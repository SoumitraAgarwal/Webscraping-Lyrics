Anne Sofie von Otter,"The stars were so much brighter then
They dim and die
So why pretend
The sky goes on forever?

But if they fade as science teaches
Poets lose the power of speech
Waste paper, ink, and feather

If I'd taken up the trumpet
As I should have done
Then I wouldn't be
Always losing sleep
While I'm trying to make this rhyme

For the stars were so much
They were so much brighter, then
If I couldn't put a price on your head
What's the use of me trying
For the stars?

The morning comes
The days are just the time between
Until the dusk
When we can be together

If I'd taken up the drums
And I could play in time
If I had the power
Would I be wondering how
I'm ever going to be write this down?

For the stars were so much
They were so much brighter then
If I couldn't put a price on your head
Then what's the use of me trying
For the stars?",For the Stars
Anne Sofie von Otter,"Go, leave 
She's better than me 
Or at least she is stronger 
She will make it last longer 
That's nice for you 

Go, leave 
Don't come back 
No more am I for the taking 
But I can't say that my heart's not aching 
It's breaking in two 

I remember days when we laughed a lot 
Those that weren't so good I soon forgot 
We could sit and talk till words 
Were coming out our ears 
Not just for days or weeks or months 
But it's been years 
Now here they come 
Here they come here come my tears 

So go, leave 
You said goodbye 
But could it be that you are stalling 
Hearts have a way of calling 
When they've been true 
",Go Leave
Anne Sofie von Otter,"Fine rain was falling on the gravel and glades. 
The last rays of September bejewelled broken blades. 
But there's someone that I long for. 
Oh, where have you been? 
As the red earth lies under a covering of green. 
Do you trip on the city's golden gutters and kerbs? 
As the seasons grow wild and the ground undisturbed. 
'Til you find what you are now 
Is less than you've been; 
As the red earth lies under a covering of green. 
Is patience exhausted? 
Are your pockets picked clean? 
I was lost in the next world 
Or somewhere in between. 
And it's much as predicted, 
They go down that same track. 
They say they'll return 
But they never come back. 
Fine rain was falling on the gravel and glades. 
The lest rays of September bejewelled broken blades. 
Are you still restless
Or are you serene? 
As the red earth lies under just a covering of green.",Green Song
Anne Sofie von Otter,"[Chorus:]
I want to vanish
This is my fondest wish
To go where I cannot be captured
Laid on a decorated dish
Even in splendor this curious fate
Is more than I care to surrender
Now it's too late

Whether in wonder or indecent haste
You arrange the mirrors and the spools
To snare the rare and precious jewels
That were only made of paste

If you should stumble upon my last remark
I'm crying in the wilderness
I'm trying my best to make it dark
How can I tell you I'm rarer than most
I'm certain as a lost dog
Pondering a sign post

[Chorus]

I want to vanish
This is my last request
I've given you the awful truth
Now give me my rest 
",I Want To Vanish
Anne Sofie von Otter,"In the cold pale sunlight that was slanting down, I spied 
Frost reflecting on the glass and in the air outside, 
Fond relations mouthing words of love and tragedy. 
Though it's cold there's vapour rising from a moving stream. 

In a narrow, shallow bed of fine linen and starch, 
Where her long hair tumbled once upon her graceful arch, 
Lace hung on the counters and the walnut cabinets, 
Teeth ware chattering like schoolgirls clicking castanets. 

There will be no light to guide as you ascend the stairs. 
There may be a candle as you kneel and say your prayers. 
Throw the window wide and open, keep this mark from me, 
Just the letter ""T"" and its most dread companion ""be	"". 

How in heaven? Hadn't it been conquered long ago? 
How did it come back again? It's just a curio.",Just a Curio
Anne Sofie von Otter,"Long awaited darkness falls 
Casting shadows on the walls 
In the twilight hour I am alone 
Sitting near the fireplace, dying embers warm my face 
In this peaceful solitude 
All the outside world subdued 
Everything comes back to me again 
In the gloom 
Like an angel passing through my room 

Half awake and half in dreams 
Seeing long forgotten scenes 
So the present runs into the past 
Now and then become entwined, playing games within my mind 
Like the embers as they die 
Love was one prolonged good-bye 
And it all comes back to me tonight 
In the gloom 
Like an angel passing through my room 

I close my eyes 
And my twilight images go by 
All too soon 
Like an angel passing through my room 

",Like an Angel Passing Through My Room
Anne Sofie von Otter,"I stole a glance at my reflection,
Though these days I tend to hurry by.
How pale the rose of my complexion,
How strange the knowing look that's in my eye.
But when the springtime was ablaze,
You took my hand, you held my gaze.

There is no wonder there,
I learned my lesson well,
No need to wonder where that girl has gone.

There is a secret no one knows,
I set my face, I changed my clothes

I dreamed I stood as you were passing,
Just as the horse-drawn carriage sped away.
Of petticoats in puddles dragging,
And my highbutton boots were splashed with clay.

But when the summer was in flame,
You broke your word, denied my name.

There is no wonder there, etc.

But as the winter drags along,
It blurs your sense of right and wrong.

There is no wonder there, etc.
",No Wonder
Anne Sofie von Otter,"The other woman finds time to manicure her nails
The other woman is perfect where her rival fails
And shes never seen with pin curls in her hair

The other woman enchantes her clothes with french perfume
The other woman keeps fresh cut flowers in each room
There are never toys thats scattered everywhere

And when her baby comes to call
Hell find her waiting like a lonesome queen
Cos when shes by his side
Its such a change from old routine

But the other woman will always cry herself to sleep
The other woman will never have his love to keep
And as the years go by the other woman
Will spend her life alone
",The Other Woman
Anne Sofie von Otter,"Down by the harbourside 
A boat is fastened by a length of rope. 
It was a perfect match, 
Dreaming of escape, 
Feeling almost detached. 
Look beneath the waves - 
The seabirds diving down into black water. 
The morning bells begin, 
Schoolchildren chant and spin. 
A length of rope 
Below a hanging tree, 
Like cruel secrets some of us turn out to be. 
Should our love increase, 
We are all released like statues from marble. 
While in a prison yard, 
They're taking turns to guard 
A length of rope. 
Are you too weak to fight? 
Picking up a thread and then stretching it tight. 
Look beneath the waves - 
The seabirds diving down into black water. 
Still our love increased, 
We are all released like statues from marble.",Rope
Anne Sofie von Otter,"I fear, my dear
We've forgotten the things strangers do
If we could look back
To the terrible thrill that we knew
Am I imagining a world without you?
Must we be shamed into love?

What can I say?
Will you pardon my stupid embrace?
Sometimes I`m desperate
While you`re wiping the smile from your face
Am I surrendering, or am I replaced?
Must we be shamed into love?

Shamed into love
You`re once a fool for having it
Twice for letting it go
Somewhere, my love, there`s a feeling deep inside of me
That I can`t let go
Oh, you`ll never know

But then, my darling
I've forbidden myself to confess
I've looked around now
But I always return to your face
In a world where everything
I once cursed, I bless
It must be you who shamed me into love

Must we be shamed into love?",Shamed Into Love
Anne Sofie von Otter,"These rooms play tricks upon you
Remember when they were always filled with laughter
But now they're quite deserted
They seem to just echo voices raised in anger
Maybe you will see my face
Reflected there on the pane
In the window up above for long
In broken home

Yet this house is empty now
There's nothing I can do
To make you want to stay
So tell me how am I supposed to live without you

These walls were lined with pictures
Remember the glass we charged in celebration
But now I fill my life up
With all that I can to deaden this sensation
Do you recognize the face
Fixed in that fine silver frame
Were you really so unhappy there
You never said

So this house is empty now
There's nothing I can do to make you want to stay
So tell me how am I supposed to live without you

Oh, if I could just become forgetful
When night seems endless
Does the extinguished candle care
About the darkness

It's funny how the memory
Will bring you so close then make you disappear
Meanwhile all our friends must choose
Who they will favor, who they will lose
Hang the garland high, or close the door
Or throw away the key

This house is empty now
There's no one living here
You have to care about
This house is empty now
There's nothing I can do
To make you want to stay
So tell me how am I supposed to live without you

This house is empty now
This house is empty now
There's nothing I can do
This house is empty now
This house is empty now",This House Is Empty Now
Anne Sofie von Otter,"I know perfectly well
Im not where I should be
Ive been very aware
Youve been patient with me

Every time we break up
You bring back your love to me
And after all Ive done to you
How can it be

You still believe in me

I try hard to be more
What you want me to be
But I cant help how I act
When youre not here with me

I try hard to be strong
But sometimes I fail myself
And after all Ive promised you
So faithfully

You still believe in me

I wanna cry...
",You Still Believe in Me
Anne Sofie von Otter,"I work all night, I work all day, to pay the bills I have to pay
Ain't it sad
And still there never seems to be a single penny left for me
That's too bad
In my dreams I have a plan
If I got me a wealthy man
I wouldn't have to work at all, I'd fool around and have a ball...

Money, money, money
Must be funny
In the rich man's world
Money, money, money
Always sunny
In the rich man's world
Aha-ahaaa
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world

A man like that is hard to find but I can't get him off my mind
Ain't it sad
And if he happens to be free I bet he wouldn't fancy me
That's too bad
So I must leave, I'll have to go
To Las Vegas or Monaco
And win a fortune in a game, my life will never be the same...

Money, money, money
Must be funny
In the rich man's world
Money, money, money
Always sunny

If I had a little money

Anne Sofie von Otter,"I don't wanna talk about things we've gone through,
Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.
The winner takes it all,
The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.
 
I don't wanna talk if it makes you feel sad,
And I understand you've come to shake my hand.
I apologize if it makes you feel bad seeing me so tense, no self confidence.",The Winner Takes It All
Anne Soldaat,"Tomorrow is everything and today we best forget 
We shine a light, to find our way and we lay our heads to rest 
We're just waiting for the sun 
From pillowtalk to pillowdream as we ramble on and on 

My troubles are diluted, they're like poison in a sea 
That don't mean the problem's solved, it just means they can't hurt me 

Baby-love you're all I need 
I've been loving you and happy too from the day we met 
But it's hard to know your man when his mouth is shut 
So I'm never sure just what goes on inside your head 

Too bad I'm just not equipped to cope with modern strain 
Why don't we live inside the woods and we shower in the rain 
'Cause a nature boy I am 
But nature boys, they are like toys in the hands of modern man 

Baby-blue, you're all I need 
And I want you near so many times, but you're not there 
Sure you need your time to create 
But every song just takes so long and it's getting late 

Tomorrow, it don't mean a thing and today we best forget 
Changing moods from day to day, as we live inside our head 

We're just waiting for the sun 
From pillowtalk to pillow dreams, as we ramble on and on",Pillow Talk
Anne Soldaat,"One thing's for sure, I can't explain
Why my left and my right side - they don't look the same
Now I'm a dancer, you don't come close
With my hands in the air - my nose

'Cause what you got, I can't explain
So I pinch myself, to make sure I feel again
It could be magic, could be drag
But as long as you're here - it's fab

Pray for delay
The phone's ringing but I can wait
yes, I can wait

I seize the day
No looking back on what is gone
'Cause I've been waiting far too long

You want so much, just more and more
The announcment I made, was what you're waiting for
And with a smile I fix the rope
As long as there's pain, there's hope

There's only half of you to please
So the other half can go and rest in peace
And if you're uptight and not too lame
In a moment you'll feel the same

Pray for delay
The phone's ringing but I can wait
yes, I can wait

I seize the day
No looking back on what is gone
Cause I've been waiting far too long",Pray for Delay
Anne Walsh,"In the still of the night
As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be

Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Anne Walsh,"Why don't we take a little piece of summer sky, 
Hang it on a tree.
For that's the way to start to make a pretty world, 
For you and for me.

And for the sun we'll take a lemon bright balloon, 
You can hold the string.
Oh, can't you see that little world of ours will be, 
The prettiest thing.

We can gather rain enough for the stream, 
To hold our happy faces.
When you want a breeze, 
I'll blow you a kiss or two.

Take me in your arms and our little world, 
Will be the place of places.
Nothing must be made but breakfast and love.

We'll hang a little sign that just says, ""Paradise, 
Population two.""
I know together, 
We can make a pretty world, 
For me and for you -- for you, 
It's what I'm longing to do -- to do, 
To make a world with you.

Anne Weiss,"I have gathered all this distance
from the height called falling down
and from this lowland place I can
reach mountains hidden in my hands

hair shorn to silver
tattoos underneath his scars

sitting smugly in the cars

Modern cowboy cadres, guns and glory dudes

Warum vertragt ihr euch nicht einfach oder küsst euch wieder mal? 
Fragt sie und denkt, es ist ja schließlich nur ein Streit
Und ihren Freunden sagt sie oft, dass das schon klappt
Man muss nur warten und sie wartet, doch ein Zweifel ist, was bleibt

Und sie räumt öfter wieder auf 
Und sie geht wieder zum Ballett und sie hilft spülen, 
Falls das irgendetwas bringt

Ist ziemlich streng und sehr genau
Und wenn Paul Witze macht und lacht
Schaut sie adrett und mit Bedacht

Wenn man genau hinsieht, dann grinst sie
Weil sie ihn noch immer mag
Und das seit 55 Jahren
Und das bis zum letzten Tag

einander treu und trotzdem frei sein kann

Sie ist schon lange nicht mehr da

Und eben trotzdem, ob so bald sie auf die Bretter gehn'
Manche Ladies haben Körper, die die Welt hypnotisiern
Und ihre Liebsten schlucken Schwerter, in der Nähe dunkler Türen

Stars, was sind schon Stars?
Sie sind allein in tristen Bars
Oder Cafes und sie verstecken ihr Gesicht
Der sie liebt der tut es gern, für was sie sind in ihrem Traum
Und ihre Ehen enden meistens vor Gericht

Manche haben sich, und mehr schon, als ihr Herz dabei verbrannt
Und nach so manchem wird nachher sogar 'ne Straße neu benannt
Und sie lebt wie Marlene, spät des Nachts mit Orson Wells
Nur statt dessen mit den Lenden Ihres Marriot Hotels

Manche glauben sich geborgen und riskieren ihr Genick
Manche Leute geh'n verloren und kommen nie mehr ganz zurück
Manche Tanzen über Scherben, manche gleiten über Eis

Annett Louisan,"Ich bin seit Wochen unterwegs 
Und trinke zu viel Bier und Wein 
Meine Wohnung ist verödet 
Meinen Spiegel schlag ich kurz und klein 
Ich bin nicht der, der ich sein will 
Und will nicht sein, wer ich bin
Mein Leben ist das Chaos
Schau mal genauer hin

Ich bin tierisch eifersüchtig
Und ungerecht zu Frauen
Und wenn es ernst wird
Bin ich noch immer abgehauen
Ich frage gerade dich:
Macht das alles einen Sinn?
Mein Leben ist ein Chaos
Schau mal genauer hin

Und du glaubst, ich bin stark
Und ich kenn den Weg
Du bildest dir ein
Ich weiß, wie alles geht
Du denkst, ich hab alles im Griff
Und kontrollier was geschieht
Aber ich steh nur hier oben
Und sing mein Lied

Ich bin dauernd auf der Suche
Und weiß nicht mehr, wonach
Ich zieh nächtelang durch Bars
Immer der, der am lautesten lacht
Niemand sieht mir an
Wie verwirrt ich wirklich bin
Ist alles nur Fassade
Schau mal genauer hin

Und du glaubst, ich bin stark
Und ich kenn den Weg

Aber ich steh nur hier oben
Und sing mein Lied
Ich steh nur hier oben
Und sing mein Lied

Stell dich mit mir in die Sonne
Oder geh mit mir ein kleines Stück
Ich zeig dir meine Wahrheit
Für einen Augenblick
Ich frage mich genau wie du:
Wo ist hier der Sinn?

I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere

Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland

In a phrase how I feel

Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

And ride the wild surf they come to try
To conquer those waves some 30 feet high

And hanging round the beach you'll see the best

The surf to build up on the northern shore

Lined up and waiting for that next big set outside
Nothing can stop it cause you've just gotta ride ride ride ride ride
The heavies at the pipeline are OK
But they can't match the savage surf at Waimea Bay
It takes a lot of skill and courage unknown
To catch the last wave and ride it in alone

Well it was obvious you did not care
About the one
No you don't bother
Well I'm happy without you, honey

Oh yeah they told me
You should be careful what you do
They only use you
For his pleasures and absurd

It was the last that you deserved

To own somebody, that's absurd

I saw you
It was a rainy day in May or June
I couldn't help it
God, you looked so fine
I just had to make you mine, all mine
Well I'm a helpless fool for love

I cannot eat nor sleep, no
Hard to breathe
You read my love so easy

Twist my mind around and 1, 2, 3
Then I'm a helpless fool for...

When he talks
When he moves
Makes my day

Ah...
Not unkind
I don't mind
When he talks
Just a rush
I'm a fool for love

All shook up
I know it's stupid to precipitate
Without getting all humiliate
Didn't know what I should say or do
Everything I'll give to you and me (when I'm here without you)
We're gonna have a riot
Trust in me (I can't live without you)
I'm gonna make you happy
What you need (helpless fool without you)
I'll give you everything
I'll try to be (you know, you know, you know, you know, you know)
Still your helpless fool for...

And it seems like a dream

Ah...
Need you, Doctor Love
Are you there?
Every day I'm the helpless one

Annie,"It's time to tell my story
of a girl I used to know
Always cried into her pillow
under pinups on the wall
She didn't make Italia Conte
didn't get that TV show

with a new portfolio

feeling good on top of the pops
Can you make it me plus one?

She breaks down in the video
Think you'll find it's me plus one

Now this wannabe seniorita
met a group of likely girls
Traded posters and the voxpops
for jetting round the world
But it didn't make her happy
and now she flies alone
The wrong pictures in the paper
and no one back at home

Did you even know my name? Did you ever really care?

Chauds, j'aimerais que la foule dise ooh

De main je m'en vais donc conter le parcours
Et croyez que le voyage ne sera pas court
Il why eut beaucoup de morceaux composés que l'on a modifiés
De rimes calculées de feuilles raturées
Et des heures passées à échantilloner
Sans savoir vraiment si cela marcherait
Et tous ces kilomètres que l'on s'est tapés
Moïse à côté de nous, n'a fait que se promener
On partait le matin tôt, tout frais
On arrivait le soir avec un bâton et des caligaes
Cela s'est répété tant et tant de fois que les stations d'essence
Ont le sourire aux lèvres dès qu'elles nous voient
Pour aller faire un concert à l'autre bout de la France
On avait l'impression que see'était le temps des transhumances
Toutes ces randonnées dans un but précis
Celui de monter sur scène, histoire de voir si
La température augmente dans le foule peu à peu
Afin que nous puissions why mettre quoi? Le feu

Mets tes mains bien en l'air si see'est bon
Respecte le métèque et tout ira bien

A la force des mots sans user de danses obscènes
Saute si tu veux crie si tu le peux

Iam est ici pour embraser la nuit la partie
Tu veux des sous un crédit, trouve-toi un job chérie

Donne-moi la force de foutre le feu
Aux yeux des spectateurs et des spectatrices
Expectateurs de cette voie destructrice
Donne-moi la volonté pour ensuite écouter

Annie Haslam,"Going home, going home
I'm just going home
Quiet light, some still day
I'm just going home

It's not far, just close by
Through an open door
Work all done, care laid by
Going to fear no more

Mother's there expecting me
Father's waiting, too
Lots of folk gathered there
All the friends I knew

All the friends I knew
I'm going home
Nothing's lost, all's gain
No more fret nor pain
No more stumbling on the way
No more longing for the day
Going to roam no more

Morning star lights the way
Restless dream all done
Shadows gone, break of day
Real life begun

There's no break, there's no end
Just a living on
Wide awake with a smile
Going on and on

Going home, going home
I'm just going home
It's not far, just close by
Through an open door
I am going home

Annie Haslam,"If I loved you, time and again
I would try to say all I'd want you to know
If I loved you, words wouldn't come
In an easy way, round in circles I'd go

[Chorus:]
Longing to tell you but afraid and shy
I'd let my golden chances pass me by
Soon you'd leave me
Off you would go in the mist of day
Never, never to know
How I love you, if I loved you

[Chorus]",If I Loved You
Annie Haslam,"Holding on to yesterday
Meant all the world to me
Finding out that you exist
Has made a clearer day to see
Only this morning
When I realised
Sun shining through
My window open wide
Feelings that held my heart
Close to all your smiles

Living in an empty space
Surrounded by broken lies
How my meaning had been lost
Until I found you in my eyes
How could my spirit
Free itself from doubt
Holding a dream inside
That should be out
Freer than all the streams
That have flowed to the sea

[Chorus]
If there's a moment
That belongs to me only
It must be now you are here
Inside my life
And if I can be forever
In the closeness of you
Then I'll stay
As a shadow on your mind
Left for your memories to find

Looking into sleepy eyes
Gazing across my view
Knowing that tomorrow brings
A day containing one less fool
Finding the answer
Lying in your love
Carries on living
Now that there's enough
Happiness to be found
Sharing time with our lives

[Chorus]",Inside My Life
Annie Haslam,"There was a boy
A very strange enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far
Very far
Over land and sea
A little shy
And sad of eye
But very wise
Very wise was he

Then one day
A magic day he passed my way
And while he spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me
The greatest thing
You'll ever learn
Is to love
And be loved in return

Then one day

Annie Haslam,"Past lovers whisper
Temptations from before
But I've learned illusion
I don't listen anymore

Some memories thicker still
On my silver screen
But I turn and walk away
From what might have been

I'm breaking ground
Into something that's real
Forgotten tenderness
You show me how to feel

Further from fantasy
I'm closer to you
More I remember
The more I'm pulling through
Further from fantasy
I'm closer to you

From pieces of my dream
You're by my side
Confusion washed away
By the rising tide

The rhythm of my heart
Is like the rhythm of the sea
Can't tell a breath apart
Is it you or me

My passions turned
From dull gray to gold
Fly again now
I've got someone true to hold

[Chorus]
Further from fantasy
I'm closer to you
More I remember
The more I'm pulling through

Someone's gotta love you baby
Let it be me oh let it be me
Someone's gotta sooner or later

You think promises were made to be broken
I want to prove that you're wrong

Annie Haslam,"The first time ever she saw him,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
He passed on worried and warning,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Lost in a riddle that Saturday night,
Far away on the other side.
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
And she couldn't find how to push through.
The trees that whisper in the evening,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
All she saw was a silhouette of a gun,
Far away on the other side.
He was shot six times by a man on the run
And she couldn't find how to push through.
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven far away.
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven one day.
Four a.m. in the morning,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
I watched your vision forming,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Stars roll slowly in a silvery night,
Far away on the other side.
Will you come to terms with me this night,
But she couldn't find how to push through.
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven far away.
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven one day.
Far away on the other side.
Caught in the middle of a hundred and five.
The night was heavy and the air was alive,
But she couldn't find how to push through.
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Far away on the other side.
But she couldn't find how to push through.",Moonlight Shadow
Annie Haslam,"Break the ice you can help me understand
Take the night into your own hands

Take one step closer let love start over
Shoot one more arrow through my heart
We'll come back stronger and hold on longer
Shoot one more arrow through my heart

Unashamed it can't be wrong to try again
No one's to blame but just a quiet end

I knew love so sweet and so secure
Turning with an open heart
With a touch we would never be apart

So much pain to see that love betrays
I will never love again
For love lies, and it will die in the end

If I knew then what I know now
If I had known it all somehow
Always believing love is deceiving
I could have held my shattered dreams
Seen all the things I should have seen
Now I know love lies
Now I know love is bound to die

Flames of love now ash just drifts away
Here I am: I'm lost, and love's astray
I can never love again
For love lied and then it died in the end

I thought I saw love in his eyes
But now I know that love just lies
Leaving me hollow, nothing to follow
So I will never give my heart
And I will be a woman apart
Now I know love lies
Now I know love is bound to die

And love was nothing but a need
Devoured by an empty greed
The ashes fill my empty heart
I will always stand apart
This from love's beguiling mask
A kiss, the questions never asked
And now I know that love just lies
I know love is bound to die

And it's true reflections casting shadow to the light
So still, it seems that we are etched in smoke tonight
We will remember this
The sweetest kiss

Should our dreams drift by as time unfolds
Between the sea and sky above
We will stay together, we will hold
The peace and purity of love

I see life and light; it shines from you
A fragrance on the cooling breeze
We will see infinity come through
And who would not love days like these?

And it's true: the music's flowing echoes in the light
Quietly now we are sketched in the mist tonight

And never dies - never dies

Of a newly opened heart

Annie Haslam,"Why do we love so carelessly
A broken heart can never feel the same
Why do we make everything so hollow, and then borrow
Someone's love, selfishly

Why do we take the easy way
No looking back, you never see the pain
Why do we hurt, people who we care for, and would bear for
If we thought, with understanding and with caring in our hearts
If we could see, if only we could see
All the love we lost - carelessly

Why do we take and not return
No going back, you never meet again
Why do we think, always of our selfish need and go with greed
When if we knew with certainty and caring in our hearts
If we could see, if only we could see, all the love we lost
All the love we lost - carelessly","Careless love (Arr. of Chopin's Etude Op. 10, No. 3)"

Moves in a sea of light

I'd like to share with you tonight
Come here
Out of the darkness
I walk into a pool of light

And everything above me
Was all so clear

Free to roam the earth
Through the sun, the sand, the surf

I'll share with you the golden songs
I hear
A new beginning
A time of love for everyone

Annie Haslam,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From angels bending near the earth
To touch their harps of gold:
""Peace on the earth, good will to men
From heaven's all-gracious King.""
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the angels sing!

Yet with the woes of sin and strife
The world has suffered long
Beneath the angel strain have rolled
Two thousand years of wrong
And man, at war with man, hears not
The love song which they bring:
""O hush the noise, ye men of strife
And hear the angels sing!""

Still through the cloven skies they come
With peaceful wings unfurled
And still their heavenly music floats
Over all the weary world
Above its sad and lowly plains
They bend on hovering wing
And ever over its Babel sounds
The blessed angels sing

All ye, beneath life's crushing load
Whose forms are bending low
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow
Look, now, for glad and golden hours
Come swiftly on the wing
O rest beside the weary road
And hear the angels sing!

For lo! the days are hastening on
By prophet bards foretold
When with the ever-circling years
Comes 'round the age of gold
When peace shall over all the earth
Its ancient splendors fling
And the whole world give back the song
Which now the angels sing!",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear

It is the night of the dear Savior's birth

Till he appeared, and the soul felt its worth

For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees; O, hear the angel voices!
O night divine, O night when Christ was born!
O night, O holy night, O night divine

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by his cradle we stand
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming

The King of kings lay thus in lowly manger
In all our trials born to be our friend
He knows our need, to our weaknesses is no stranger
Behold your King, before him lowly bend!

Truly he taught us to love one another
His law is love, and his gospel is peace
Chains shall he break, for the slave is our brother
And in his name all oppression shall cease

When you hear her call you across a crowded room,

And Joan's very thick with Miss Blewitt
So Monica's sulking alone

So her coronets caught in the traces
And now all her fetlocks are loose

I know that you'll succeed
And if you want to hurt me
There's nothing left to fear
'Cause if you want to hurt me
You're doing really well, my dear

Now everyone of us was made to suffer
Everyone of us was made to weep

Save me from the blast

It know not how it sound
For it is the drum of drums
It is the song of songs

Once I had rarest rose
That ever deigned to bloom.
Cruel winter chilled the bud
And stole my flower too soon.

Oh loneliness, oh hopelessness
To search the ends of time
For there is in all the world
No greater love than mine.

Love, oh love, oh love
Still falls the rain (still falls the rain)
Love, oh love, oh, love
Still falls the night 
Love, oh love, oh love
Be mine forever (be mine forever)
Love, oh love, oh love

Let me be the only one
To keep you from the cold
Now the floor of heaven's lain
With stars of brightest gold

They shine for you, they shine for you
They burn for all to see

And set this spirit free",Love Song for a Vampire

It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate

It's five o'clock in the morning
And you're just getting in
A knock upon the door
A voice sweet and low says
(who is it?)
She opens up the door
And she lets you in
And never once does she say
""where have you been?""

She says,""hold it,
Are you hungry,did you eat yet,
Let me hang up your coat now""
And all the time she's smiling
Never raises her voice
It's five o'clock in the morning
And you don't give it a second thought

[Chorus]

The sweetest woman in the world

Could be the meanest woman in the world
If you make her be that way
She might be holding something in
That's really gonna hurt you
One of these fine days

There you are in the hospital
Bandaged from foot to head
In a state of shock
That much from bein' dead
You didn't think your woman
Could do something like that to you
You didn't think she'd got the nerve
Actions speak louder than words
Louder than words
Louder than words
Louder than words,come on

If you won't give a damn about me
Come on baby, baby
You don't really care about me

By your man
Tell me something
I don't understand

And then you left me
Said you felt trapped

But the heartache's with me till this day

[Chorus]
did you stand by me
No,not at all
Did you stand by me
No way

All the times
That we were closed
I remember
These things the most
I've seen all our dreams
Come tumblin' down
I can't stay happy
Without you around

So alone I keep the wolves a bay
And there's only one thing I can say

You must explain
Why this must be
Did you lie
When you spoke to me

Did you stand by me
No,not at all

Now I got a job
But it don't pay
I need new clothes
I need somewhere to stay
But without all these things I can do
But without your love I won't make it through
Without you love I won't make it through

But you don't understand my point of view
I suppose there's nothing I can do

Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor

And the room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
But the waiter brought a tray
And so it was later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

You said there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be
And one of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might just as well be closed
And so it was later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

Is like a mirror on the shelf
And the only one you're blaming 
is yourself

A million little deaths you've died
The times that you've been crucified
The more you've loved and lost and tried
And still could not be satisfied
When will you be satisfied?
When will you be satisfied?
Not till the hurtin' time begins",The Hurting Time
Annie Lennox,"Loneliness
Is a place that I know well
It's the distance between us
And the space inside ourselves
And emptiness

Is the chattering in your head
It's the call of the living
And the race from life to death
Whoa and I know
Yes and I know
What you feel

And I've got a longin'
That's hard to find
Won't give me no peace of mind
Something that I've lived with all along
Days and weeks and months and years
Filling in the time my dear
Tryin' to find the place where I belong
Hopelessness
Is the darkness in your heart
It's the sound of one hand clapping
While it's pulling you apart
Woa and I know
Yes and I know
What you feel
And 
I've got a longin'
That's hard to find
Won't give me no peace of mind
Something that I've lived with all along
Days and weeks and months and years
Filling in the time my dear
Tryin' to find the place where I belong

And 
I got a hunger that's 
Hard to fill
Driving me on overkill
Tellin' me that everything's gone wrong
Got me a need
That I can't break
More than I can hardly take
Somehow I still keep on going strong
When I call your name
I'm gonna scream out loud
I'll say

Here I am standing in the crowd
You'll say come to me
With your open mind
You never know
What you still might find
But you keep me here
Like a cancelled flight
An empty train
Running through the night
An orphan child
A broken shoe
And I'm still down here
Looki' out for you
Are you there for me?
'Cause I'm here for you",Loneliness
Annie Lennox,"Oh God,
Where are you now?
And what you gonna do
About the mess I've made
If there was ever a soul to save
It must be me
It must be me

Dear god,
Oh how can I survive?
Will I make this drop this dive?
When it all comes to this
I'm looking down at the abyss
Where you don't exist
You don't exist

but if you hear me
If you can see me,
I know I can't be that strong
'Cause everything I ever did went wrong
Everything I ever did went wrong

Now where do I come in?
Gone and broken everything
So I hope you'll understand

It must be now
It must be now",Oh God (Prayer)

So hush little baby, don't you cry

One of these mornings you're gonna rise up a-singing
You're gonna spread your wings and away you'll fly, oh
But 'till that morning, nothin' will harm you
With daddy and mommy standin' by

Summertime, and the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high

So hush little baby, don't you cry

Watch the sunrise on a tropic isle
Just remember darling all the while
You belong to me

See the market place in old Algier
Send me photographs and souvenirs
Just remember when a dream appears
You belong to me

I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too, and blue

Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
Just remember 'till you're home again
You belong to me

I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too and blue

Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
Just remember 'till you're home again

We'll have Manhattan

It's very fancy
On old Delancey Street, you know
The subway charms us so
When balmy breezes blow
To and fro

And tell me what street
Compares with Mott Street
In July
Sweet pushcarts gently gliding by

The great big city's a wondrous toy
Just made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll go to Greenwich
Where modern men itch
To be free
And Bowling Green you'll see
With me

We'll bathe at Brighton
The fish you'll frighten
When you're in
Your bathing suit so thin
Will make the shellfish grin

Sail on Jamaica Bay with you
And fair Canarsie's lake
We'll view

Into an isle of joy

We'll go to Yonkers
Where true love conquers
In the wilds
And starve together, dear
In Childs'

We'll go to Coney
And eat baloney
On a roll
In Central Park we'll stroll
Where our first kiss we stole
Soul to soul

Our future babies
We'll take to ""Abie's Irish Rose""
I hope they'll live to see
It close

The dreams of a boy and goil

We'll try to cross Fifth Avenue
As black as onyx

We'll find the Bronnix Park Express
Our Flatbush flat, I guess
Will be a great success
More or less

The night we met
There was magic abroad in the air
There were angels dining at the Ritz
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

I may be right I may be wrong
But I'm perfectly willing to swear
That when you turned and smiled at me

The moon that lingered over London town
Poor puzzled moon he wore a frown
How could he know we two were so in love
The whole damned world seemed upside down

The streets of town were paved with stars
It was such a romantic affair
And as we kissed and said goodnight
A nightingale sang in Berekeley square

How strange it was
How sweet and strange
There was never a dream to compare
To those hazy crazy nights we met
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

Ah this heart of mine
Loud and fast
Like a merry-go-round in a fair
We would dance cheek to cheek
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley square

The dawn came stealing up
All gold and blue
To interrupt our rendez-vous
I still remember how you smiled and said
Was that a dream or was it true?

Alice in hell, what else can you do

Crying out, you've lost your doll
It isn't worth a dime

Alison hell, aren't you growing cold

Alice in hell, soon I close the door

Sitting in the corner, you are naked and alone
No one listened to your fears, you've created me

Alice isn't frightening

Devoid strength my life, inert
Anger fills they're shocked me back

Hatred turned to apathy, led down this black abyss
Good night, farewell you pig from hell, this world I shall not miss

Annotations of an Autopsy,"The age of the storm has come
And with it the end of man.
The rise of the
Hybrid race

Our power is taken from our hands before our eyes.

As man cowers before the might of their race,
We surrender our freedom and our lives.

Of a war fought in
Vein.

And witnessed the aftermath of
Heresy,
And the fall of the divine.

Shape.
Glowing, drawing ever closer.
I watched as the shape drew near
And
Before my eyes turned into a demon.

He stopped in his tracks before me.

His head layed a crown of fire.
The flames flickered as his eyes met mine.

Stood motionless in the storm

I've heard all that is to be heard.

Got your thoughts on my mind
The faster they come
They less I remember

The brightest of days
You're three states away
You squint through the sun
As you leave with the sparrows at dawn

The coldest of nights
Shaken in fright
Spit through my teeth
Roll down my chin and I stare

If I ever let out of bed
WIthout a kiss to the center of your head
Then I never deserved you from the start
And you can let loose the wall around my heart

If I never let out of my door
Never ...

If I never let out of ..
...with the family, keep it warm

The sorest of times
I can still find your line
If I'm down on my feet
If I'm hollow, I don't care

If I never let you let of my door
Never ...

If I never let out of ..
...with the family, keep it warm

Anny,"When I think of home, I think of a place
Where there's love overflowing
I wish I were home, I wish I was back there
With the things I've been knowin'
Wind that makes the tall trees bend into leaning
Suddenly the snowflakes that fall have a meaning
Sprinkling the sea
Makes it all clean

Maybe there's a way for me to go back
Now that I have some direction
It would sure be nice to back home
Where there's love and affection
And just maybe I can convince time to slow up
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up
Time be my friend
Let me start again

Suddenly my world's gone and changed it's face
But I still know where I'm goin'
I have had my mind spun around in space
And yet I've watched it growin'
If you're listening God, please don't make it hard to know
If we should believe the things that we see
Tell us should we run away, should we try and stay?
Or is better just to let things be?

Living here in this brand new world might be a fantasy
But it's taught me to love so it's real to me

A world full of love like yours and mine

Fly honies I attract
Niggaz know not to act up, dips be on my tip

But don't say nothin, just listen

Get a hold of yourself
Find something else
Stop tryna be me

Can't you see there's something wrong

Verse 2
Everybody's talking like they best friends with me
Just because they see me on the D-V-D
On the radio
I'm good to go
When I'm home alone
Like to take it slow
Sit back relax
Let my interests grown
That's just the way I flow

Yeah, take the 10:50pm train to the city
Yeah, I had a chance for romance so I do it again now

Anouk,"No hurry, I'll be waiting
My baby, now don't you worry
I'll be fine

Just take your time
To make up your mind
Draw a line
Or flip a dime
Waiting for you

It's easy, if you want to please me
Don't tell me maybe
Come back home complete me

No strings attached
That's a promise I can't keep
So I waste my time
With lazy crazy dreaming
A sparkling wine
A twist of lime
A whiskey soda, hole in time

Don't say you're sorry
Don't say it
No
Don't say you're sorry",Don't
Anouk,"So many times I've cried
When dark clouds block the sunlight
And it's raining in my heart
I'll keep my head up high

So little time to try
To find out, about the feeling
That's deep inside of you
And keeps the dream alive

So remember
When you're down and out
In the sand

So many minds are torn
By overloading senses
You're breathing in and out
No second left to sigh

Can you tell me why
Nobody will tell me
What they're feeling deep inside
We're all just telling lies

Every time you wonder
Why the feeling lingers
And it's stuck inside your soul
You're crying when you smile

So remember
When you're down and out

When you're stuck in the middle
When you can't solve the riddle
Lay it down in the sand
When you can't help but shiver
Get you finger off the trigger
Lay it down in the sand

Get it out your head
Out of your hands
Lay it down in the sand
So remember
When you're down and out
When everything's missing
And there's nobody listening
Lay it down in the sand
When you can't help but shiver
Get you finger off the trigger
Lay it down in the sand

Get it out your head
Out of your hands
Lay it down
In the sand",In the Sand
Anouk,"Can you tell me how you feel
When you turn on your tv
When you see me singing through my tears
I've saved up all these years
Can you tell me what you see
When you read the magazines
Do you see yourself in me
When you read the magazines
When the DJ plays this song
Can you tell me what you hear

And I hope you feel the way we felt
When you put us all through hell
Can you tell me how you feel now
How do feel, how do you feel
Tell me how you sleep at night
Do you take those pills like me
Or do you toss and turn
And lay your head on the pillow and fall asleep
'Cause you just don't care,
How do you feel

And now I'm in your face
And you feel that empty space
Why did we, how did we come to fall from grace
Falling, falling
Didn't you just hear us calling out
No there's nothing left to say
'Cause you shouldn't have stayed away
No man leaves his flesh and blood
This way

And I hope you feel the way we felt
When you put us all through hell
Can you tell me how you feel now
How do feel, how do you feel
Tell me how you sleep at night
Do you take those pills like me
Or do you toss and turn
And lay your head on the pillow and fall asleep
'Cause you just don't care
How do you feel

It took a crowd for me to see
That it really wasn't me
The swaying crowd is the cleansing rain
It took the pain away
And I hope you'll find yourself alone
In a million dollar home
You will be stuck
With a heart like a rock
I hope you run out of luck fool
How do you feel now
Does it hurt, does it hurt
How do you feel now
I'm just wonderin' how it feels",It Wasn't Me
Anouk,"Hey Michel how's life are you ok
I wonder if you ever think of me
It's been nine years since that kiss
I can't help but reminiss
Hey Michel do you remember

We walked the street 
To the beat 
Hand in hand you and me
Smiling faces so in love 
Hoping they all could see
That we belonged together
You and me against the world
But we found out the hard way
That it wasn't meant to be
Now it's you and her I see

You were my first and worst love
And so it only could go wrong
But that ain't that just the way you learn
Hey Michel I just wanted to let you know
That someone else has stole my heart
And now another girl has caught your eye
That does not mean I don't think of you
I'm just hoping that she'll treat you right

Do you remember how we walked the street 
To the beat 
Hand in hand you and me
Smiling faces so in love 
Hoping they all could see
That we belong together
You and me against the world
But we found out the hard way
That it wasn't meant to be
Now it's you and her I see
It's just a silly dream

Now this time to heal 
Time to let it all come down

Just don't pretend you care

When Judas takes you there, yes 

Once I really believed 
There was nothing out there for the lost and lonely 
But a voice in my head kept banging on my heart 
Says you're not the only one 

But it kills me

Anouk,"Sure got my piece of Heaven
An angel in disguise
Gone wild
But I thought you were a man
Who knew right from wrong
That's why I really don't understand
Why he's with her
It's killing me
What has she got that I don't have?
Is it the way she looks at you
Laughs with you?  Can she
Does she make you beg for more?
This is hurting
What has she got that I don't have?
I tried to call him
Anytime anywhere
But he's never there
So I went to his place
And waited all day
So he would explain it to me
And this is what he said:
There is nothing left to say
I had my fill; I went away
Your crying eyes won't change a thing
It was just a fling
Well, how could an angel break my heart?
He said: We could still be friends
Are you kidding me?
What has she got that I don't have?
Is it the way she looks at you
Talks to you?  Can she
Does she make you beg for more?
This is hurting
What has she got that I don't have?

When he loses his mind
And can't help but cry
He'll call me, and then

Anouk,"I was dreaming last night 
A figment of my brain 
On the downtown train 
And we had nowhere to go 

So we got off to take a walk 
In the pouring rain 
You said you rode it once 
And you would ride it again 
Please take me with you 

Tom waits for the morning train 
To take us away 
Me and mr. Tom Waits 
Can't wait no more 

I'm wrapped around your finger 
Two fingers on my lips 
No need to speak 
Cause it's all in our eyes 

When they turned out the lights 
They gave us one for the road 
We headed for the tracks 
And never looked back 
This could never be real

Your sweetest thing for 7 years

Don't think you own my life
I've still got my pride

I cannot help but hear your voice

This is love, just trust me baby
Other girls mean nothing to me
Why don't you keep your big mouth shut

And all the bridges that you burn
Come back one day to haunt you
It's just a matter of time

Baby, don't get me wrong
If I'm not there to catch your fall
Did I try for too long
Am I to blame for you being you

Save those tears for someone else
Your trouble's only just begun
Hands off my sunshine leave it alone
Before I go commit a crime

I'm gonna show you what you taught me
No respect, no mercy
Till you fall down on your knees for me

Anouk,"I've got a bug in my head 
And a jumping heart 
No time to spare 
Turn left turn right step on it 
Stopped by the traffic light 

And all that honking screaming 
The cabdriver is dreaming 
Of the beach and babes 
Leaning back easy as the sun goes down 
But I'm already late 
No time to spare, couldn't care less about it 
If the sky was falling down 
No I don't care you can stare while the whole world is crumbling around me 

Urban solitude breaking me down 
Keeps me dreaming 
Urban solitude shaking me down 
Keeps me dreaming 

So you've got a lot of stuff on your mind 
Or a bleeding heart when nobody cares 
Step in, step out of the rain 
Head for the flickering lights, just head for the flickering lights 
There's always somebody dancing, taking a chance 
You can find a little romance, someone will give you love 
Although it's just enough to get you through the night 
Well alright now 
No I don't care you can stare 
I don't care about it 
No I don't care you can stare, while the whole world is crumbling around me

That what I used to think
Was a lie
Is really a life

There's only one place to reach 
Only one thing to preach
And that's the highest

It's the strangest thing 
That I can feel so much

There is no reason 
There is no logic to feelings
'Cause when love is the dealer I'm addicted

So fascinating

What you've known all along

'Cause there are women at the bar to greet you everyday

May it help you ease your pain
Though the windows have a view of city rain, city rain

And if you walk in constant sorrow
And you cry for me
May it hit the painful memories
Maybe then you'll see

That if you drown yourself in liquor
Because it keeps you company
Then just remember who you're losing
And be proud to set me free

Because it don't talk back or disagree
It just makes you see so hazily
But in the morning light your life is scattered with the wind
Scattered with the wind

I said they tell you he's a sinking ship
And he's trying to pull you down

You know you break my heart
You said you want me to come back home and try again
You want me to make a brand new start

Then it's hell, because you just don't know

But you like to see me crawling
What his body wants to be
But it feels just only falling
Down, once in paradise
One searches his way back home

And I said
What is cool
What is time
What is sport
What is crime
What is death
What is hiding
I'll wake up in time

We all are lost inside the maze
We can find our way home
Not baby, wouldn't it be great?
If we could turn it all around
All around, all around
Turn it all around
All around, all around",Daze
Anouk,"We're breaking things we can't repair
But none of us will take the blame
No nothing can be done this time

I threw them all away

Don't let me get you down
Let's just move on
I am setting you free

'Cause I don't wanna hurt no more
No I don't wanna make you go through one more rainy day
No I don't wanna hurt no more

I'm taking off today
I don't wanna hurt no more

The darkness you left in my soul
Do we know how much we've lost
Will the moon be shine in his bright as before
And his arms sing in the song
Tears well up in my eyes
And I will always wonder

Why I will never have
The life I wanted
Now I'm letting it go

'Cause I don't wanna hurt no more
No I don't wanna make you go through one more rainy day
No I don't wanna hurt no more
There's not much more to say
'Cause it's to late now
I won't hurt no more

So I wait 'till morning comes
You made it clear that it has been only pain loving me
Things that we won't do for love
I am setting you free

You got it all
What makes you hesitate

For things to blow up in your pretty face

You try not to let it slip away

So hard to see
When there's something wrong
It goes on and on

You got your ball and chain
I found out the second
Round that somethings never change
Open my eyes 
And let the days come over me
Maybe it will go away

People just don't know you

When you're making it

Water's so much colder

Doesn't make it right for you 
To decide that you don't have to stay

Break Through to the other side

Ever gonna let me know
That you just wanted
Something else in life

What do you say when it's all over
What do you know when nothing's going
Right the troubles in your mind
What do you do when you
Get lost inside your soul
Where do you go when love's gone
What do you say nothing at all

It was so hard when I watched you falling down
But it was time for you to walk alone
Just know if you really need a friend
And you're feeling like you can't go on

Just walk back just a little bit faster
Take my hand I will blow your fears away
Break through to the other side
For bitter or worse I know
You better than anyone else
And I'll be by your side

What do you say when it's all over
What do you do when it's all gone
What do you do when you
Get lost inside your soul
Where do we go when love's gone
What do you say nothing at all

When it all becomes reality
That this is where it ends for you and me
I'm about to lose my mind
Will love find a way on time
Please don't try and kiss these tears away
We know we've both have made mistakes
If I could do it all again
I wouldn't change a single thing

What do you do when it's all gone

Clouds have taken all the light
I have no control it seems my
Thoughts wander off

Of the time when I tried to
Live life without you

Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride

If being myself is what I do wrong
Then I would rather not be right
Hopes turn into fear and with my
One wing I can’t fly

With sunrise embrace my
Dreams tight and that’s why

Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride
Birds

To a place without fear, with no moonlight
All I need are trees and flowers and some sunlight
Where memories are being made and where the old one dies
Where love ain’t lies

Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops

Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride
That’s why birds don’t fly",Birds

De cet air triste et songeur
Pourquoi regardes tu la lune?
Que trouves tu dans cette lueur?

Un peu d'espoir, un peu d'amour
Que tu ne vois pas en plein jour
Un peu de bonheur, pas trop de larmes
Un sourire à l'ombre d'un charme

La lune est belle, elle le sait,
elle s'embrume de rouge sablé,
Quand le ciel saigne en magenta
La lune dit ""Regardez-moi""

Pourquoi regardes tu la lune?
Que trouves tu dans cette lueur?

Elle se reflète dans tes yeux
Elle y déverse de sa lumière bleue
La lune est pleine ce soir c'est beau
On pourrait peut-être prendre une photo

Mets toi devant, voilà souris
Allez souris, allez je t'en prie
Non tu ne peux pas, ne souris pas
La lune pleure, regarde-là

Pourquoi regardes tu la lune?
Que trouves tu dans cette lueur?

De la chaleur, du réconfort
Des fleurs séchées, perdus dehors
Le soleil n'a que sa lumière
Celle des étoiles est trop amer

Réveille moi lorsque tu pars
Embrasse moi s'il n'est pas trop tard
La lune n'a rien de mieux à faire
que de s'accrocher au dessus de la Terre

Et faire rêver le monde entier
A travers ses rayons de beauté
Au clair de la lune on oublie
Ca l'ami Pierrot l'a compris

Ne pleure plus, sèche tes yeux
Allons faire un tour, tous les deux
Sous le ciel noir de cette nuit

Pourquoi regardons-nous la lune?

From Monday to Friday night
And the wages that they pay me
I swear they're very light

They take out a little for the state
Little bit more for Uncle Sam
How can I ever catch up
And get myself out of this jam?

I'll move in to the jungle
Way out in the woods
The way things are happenin' here now
I ain't doin' myself no good

I go to town on Saturday
Just to pay my bills
I gotta make it early
Or the collector will come where I live

I go to church on Sunday
Get down on my knees to pray
The preacher takes up collection
And say, ""Brother, what will you pay?""

I'll move in to the jungle
Way out in the woods

Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this

Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss

Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye

Ant Banks,"For the funky beats I made I get for my grade 
I'm from the Dangerous Crew, I can't hang with you 
Cause I'm from Oakland, bitch, where the game is true 
You don't belive me? Well, come on slide through 
Because the city of dope will give you somethin' to ride to 
Put my tape in your deck and do some damages 
But the six by nines, they can't handle this 
I'm twenty-three so I'm far from a young buck 
This gin and juice is gettin' me pumped up 
Fake rappers get chumped up 
You want to slang'em, watch your face gettin' lamped up 
Well, what's my name? You can call me Banks for short 
You want to book me? You're about to see a gangsta show 
Cause I be tighter than tight, give me a brew and the mic 
And it will be on like chickenbone, you know that's right 
Some mothafuckas didn't belive that I can do this shit 
Kick some funky ass rhymes with some beats that hits 
Now I'm provin' them wrong but still suckas want to clown 
But you jealous mothafuckas ain't bringin' me down 
I kept faith in myself, that's what I had to do 
To make it out here and stop fuckin' with you 
I'm 2 the head... 

Yeah! Now all you fake niggaz: get the fuck off my nuts! 

I got my shit rollin' so now I'm like a mack in town 
And when I'm ridin' through, the hoes be flaggin' me down 
I'm just a player kickin' funky shit with the Dangerous Clique 
And all these bitches, they out to get some famous dick 
But I ain't trippin', girl, you can bring that ass on 
Cause all this jockin' shit ain't guaranteed to last long 
But while it's happenin' you know I'm straight lovin' it 
You put your pussy in position and I'm pluggin' it 
But if you're lookin' for a nigga with a touch of affection 
You better take your ass to the love connection 
Cause, hoe, I ain't got no trust in you 
Cause if another rapper comes you'll be fuckin' him too 
And that's real, save the love for ????? 
Cause it's all about mackin' in 92 
One love, I ain't goin' that far 
I'm better known as a gigolo rap star 
I like to fuck groupie bitches cause it's fun too 
And I never get played cause I'm young true 
Hoes want to be mine but that's a no no 
Get the fuck off my face, bitch, I'm 2 the head, hoe 

Now for verse three, you know it never quits 
Cause Ant Banks is in the house makin' hits 
And since I'm doin' this I gotta deal with jealous punks 
Mad cause my shit like pumps in the trunks 
And when I'm ridin' I gotta roll strapped in my 500 Benz 
Cause it's sittin' kinda phat, fake niggas smile on my face 
But they ain't bold ones 
Trippin' out cause they ain't ridin' on gold ones 
I know you're envies, that's hell of dumb for me 
Cause the shit I got, it didn't come for free 
Late nights at the studio bustin' my ass crack 
Tryin' to make hits, man, but where was your ass at? 
Probably at the corner drinkin' Old E, slangin' D 
See, you was sleepin', now everybody's know me 
I guess hard work pays and doin' nothin' is off

Take all your loot, kick down your door
The word got around you's a bitch-ass hoe
Hanging with these same ass niggas that owe you cash
That won't pay your ass
Them niggas just owe you for life
Be all in your face every day and night
If you'd have broke their ass off years ago
For fucking off all them counts of dough
You wouldn't be a broke-ass nigga today
(I'm a get that shit back) Well I'd figure you'd say that
Cause you go way back, rewind and play it back
You just a fat fucking needle in the haystack
They should've just named you jack
Cause you ain't never gonna get that back
So reminice on the things you had
Cause you having money was just a fad

You working every day and can't never gat ahead in life
Stop punking out running cause you're scared to fight
You hang with nine broke niggas, you know the rest
Kiss a fake nigga ass and give a hoe respect
Lying all the time about your cash flow
And talking about shit that you think you know
Well motherfucker if you only knew
You made the next nigga rich while he stole your loot
You've been hoeing so long I bet you feel like a bitch
Why can't niggas like you get rich?
Cause you gotta be a hustler, can't be a buster
You ever get a ho, nigga, please don't trust her
Used to be rapping, now you slanging dope
Stressing so hard you want to hang your hope
Dreamed of owning a house, maybe two or three cars
Come up like a motherfucking movie star
But the shit ain't happened yet
And I'm an old-school rappin' vet
You trying to get your loot, I say you ain't some
Niggas get their cash, and some can't
Short Dog on the mic, watch me gank this bitch
All that shit you doing, boy you can't get rich
But don't give up, just stop faking the shit
Get off your ass and start making it, biiiitch!

Niggas in Oakland all day long 
Be pimping these hoes from dusk til dawn 
Making cash real fast and you know it's on 
Hanging on the streets of Oakland 

All we do is smoke that weed 
And drink brew on the ave til we get keyed 
And a little bit of head is all we need 
Hanging on the streets of Oakland 

Welcome to the danger zone, where the niggas don't play that 
Every man for self, the rule is to stay strapped 
'Cause rat packers try to jack that ass 
From the jealousy that's built in the streets when you stack cash 

And they'll blast, hoping they can get get it 
Punk, so if you got it, you best to get with it 
Or quit it, cause niggas be flipping over dope and 
Your friends might get you if you're slipping in Oakland 

Yeah, so don't play no punk-ass nigga close 
'Cause they'll mash on your cash and get ghost 
And don't say Ant Banks didn't warn ya 
About the loced-ass gangstas killing in California 

That's where I'm from, nigga, rolling in my G-ride 
Hey, you gonna see me slide when I'm on the Eastside 
Making all my fucking gitnotes 
Making sure my gat straight smitnokes, smobbing with my fitnokes 

That's all we doing is the town is seeing bitches clowning 
Kicking back getting high lounging 
It really doesn't matter what you do, yo chilling with your crew 
You're sipping on a brew, you're pimping bitches too 

And the shit don't bother me if that's how it's gotta be 
Then macking these hoes should be equality 
See, the game goes deep when you're rolling 
Hanging on the streets of Oakland

Nighttime falls and everybody's perking 
No punks around so funks occurring 
But the sideshow's back and everybody's flossing 
In they ride trying to side and all the freaks are tossing 

And brother with bump, trunk of funk is knocking 
Candy paint on they ride keeps the bitches jocking 
Knowing you's a balling-ass nigga everybody hates 
Rolling in the town with a pound straight dropping weight 

Blowing up like dynamite 
Selling weed, yey, angel dust, hop, and China white 
Fuck it, you're making duckets, never riding buckets 
Playing punk bitches like puppets 

Yo, but there's a lot of fake counterfeit macks 
Playa hating on they homies trying to dry cat 
To look good for the hoes, man these niggas ain't joking 
Boy, you get that ass smoked in Oakland 

[Chorus] 

Aw yeah, The Coup is up in here, and we be talking about the real. 
Motherfuckers know that we know, that they know, that we know the deal. 
Now the originality of our principality is that we don't play the pimp. 
But the reality of our locality, and you'll learn this gradually, 

Is that motherfuckers do this shit to pay their rent. 
But here's a hint: how we gonna get it straight when we bent? 
Shit, see I ain't never had shit but my stripes and my game and my life, 
And all them's just hand downs from my grandaddy. 

Yeah, I'm living large kidding with Ant Banks, 
But I'm still hustling food stamps for my candy apple red Caddy.

It's a blessing so let me speak and teach a lesson
I run deep and freak on streets, I keep 'em guessin'
I'm flexin' when I hit the Hennessy
Then I see the enemy
Pretender think that he know my identity
But nigga that's a penalty so here we go again
You think you know what I'm foldin'
Cause what I'm rollin' in
Well I don't give a fuck nigga I was in the cut 
While you was up at my spot tryin' to peep what I got
Why not bust a shot when I was ridin' you was mad
And see me in the bucket and thought I was doin' bad
Thinkin' that I was broke but you can peep and goin' wonder
But little did you know that I was creepin' on the under
Goin' yonder now you dumber cause your number has been pulled 
You fool cause that shit you thought you knew was bull
At this beef where you at see I'm speakin' the facts
So forget that chit-chat cause it's deeper than that
And I'm keepin' a Gat and let my Tecs blast quick
So why the fuck you sittin' back stressin' of the next man's shit
Cause I'm the fuckin' one and only

I own a gun 16 shots bust up on this one
Yeah motherfuckers I'm the one
With beats from the streets
So don't talk that shit and be scared to come to me
I know them punk ass niggas be jockin' my flows
But when I turn my back they just yap like some gossippin' hoes
I guess I ain't got no true friends but I got a few wins
To pay for paint and put this AMG's on my new Benz
Them jealous niggas steady guessin' and wonderin'
Tryin' to catch up but stuck stressin' and wonderin'
I'm never stumblin' just bundlin' up my cash
I gotta last so I don't give a fuck to blast
My mind be havin' sinister thoughts 
I guess it's because I always mug when the ministers talk
I'm heavy-weightin' capable to breakin' a fool's neck

Cause I'm makin' cash and they ass stuck up on a pipe now
I write down facts so the saps think that I'm dissin'
But listen guess this is just an addiction for non-fiction
And niggas break on the tracks and fat tapes
That Max makes so homie wait and get your fact straight
But act fake and end up bendin' from back brakes

Crashed up his ribs with my body blows
I got him froze tremblin' cold with his snotty nose
You chose not to have a hustle now you desirin' mines 
Tryin' to find out my mix but I got those clips for inquirin' minds
Them tirin' lines I'm hearin' ain't phasin' me
I was raised a G and that's what I'm paid to be
So fuck them suckers with them false accusations
Lookin' for my location tryin' to stop my operation

Wise crackin' felines, uh. 
Can a nigga make a bee-line
To that nappy area?  Don't want to marry ya;
Just want to bury ya head in a pillow.
Sorry, but I got a kill yo' pussy-willow.
Janked ass penicillin; ain't got ta ask how ya feelin';
I'm tha nigga that got ya squealin'.
Ya want to know how we keep these hos in check? 
Keep them broke, and keep their panties soakin' wet.
I like to smoke big, ride fat, and always stack cash.
Believe me, keep her breezy with her fat ass.  (Fat ass.) 
Big thangs on my mind; ain't trippin' at all.
They call me $hort, but I got a big dick in my drawers;
I feel like a giant sometimes; bitch, don't stare,
You'll go blind from my diamonds
Tryin' ta size me up, but basketball I ain't playin'.
Call a tech; blow the whistle; throw the bitch out the game.

[Chorus]
We havin' big thangs, (like it's the thang to do;) 
Big thangs, baby, ($hort Dawg and Cube.) 
We havin' big thangs, (like it's the thang to do;) 
Big thangs, baby, (you know it's true; really doe.)
 
[Ice Cube, Too $hort]
Now how can I let this bitch run it,
When her ass ain't never felt the seats of a six hunnit?  (Now.) 
Tricks, we take shits at the rents; we don't get excited 
Over long hair and big tits.
$hort Dawg, they get hella weak when I tell the freak 
We the richest niggas that you gonna ever meet.
We got bosses in the back, countin' the stack.
We got cunts in the front, with Hennesey and blunts.
Now what you want? 
She want to get fucked all night long; bitch, what's up? 
You know I got a tight song;
Heard me on the radio; I can't go wrong.
But you ain't got no features; this can't go on.
You're like a bundle of joy, but you're unemployed.
You ain't throwin', so the pussy is just null and void.
Do you really understand what I'm tellin' you?
Looks can be deceiving, and bitch, I ain't even feelin' you.

[Chorus x 2]

Best believe me; it ain't easy, to be off the heazee.

[Ice Cube, Too $hort]
You can try and figure out the new shit we on.
Before you break yourself make yourself at home.
Give thanks, when it's Ice Cube, $hort Dawg, and Ant Banks.
We all platinum; now ya got ta add francs
To the salary; that'll be cash or charge.
So large; got a whole floor actin' mirage.
We like big thangs; we like runnin' big trains
Of big beautiful bitches with big brains.
Bitches with big brains; I went to Spelman College
To see if my dick could get some higher knowledge.
But pussy is pussy, from Bel-Air to the projects;
Bitch better suck my dick.
Ain't nothin' new; the game is old.
You think the bitch is decent, and that's the same old ho;
Used to fuck the whole crew; we was ballin', man.
Westside!  You know we doin' big thangs.

[Chorus]

[Ice Cube, $hort Dawg]
We off that heazee, bitch.
Beeeyyyitch.
Hey $hort, give 'em yo' part.
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, make me rich.
Do all that shit.
She can even lick my dick, but I ain't lickin' no clits.

Ant-Bee,"She looked at me
And the emptiness in her eyes was cruel to see
Then she turned away and said,
""Once I loved, but love is dead""
And I whispered, ""Sometimes love is only sleeping""

She said, ""I cannot cry
And I cannot give or feel or even try""
And her voice was hard and cold
Then her sweet young face looked old
And I whispered, ""Sometimes love is only sleeping""

Through the endless days and nights
Could not help but wrap herself in sorrow (sorrow)
Through the endless days and nights
She waited for a shiny new tomorrow
Love was sleeping, sleeping

She looked at me
And her smiling tears were warm and sweet and free
And the moonlight kissed her eyes
As it mingled with our sighs
And she whispered, ""Sometimes love is only sleeping""
And she whispered, ""Sometimes love is only sleeping""
Only sleeping",Love Is Only Sleeping
Antara,"History speaks a thousand words the past is never done
What I thought were finished pages were just songs I'd left unsung
My history speaks to me when I lie awake at night
Speaking angry words and images to remind me of the fight
I'm using my time wisely I am trying to get clear
I'm trying to get in touch with what I love and what I fear
But what I love is freedom what I fear is freedom too
When I'm looking at my enemy is it me or is it you?

Every breath take is a choice
Every look I see a vision
With every step I take I move…move into a new direction.

Am I moving in a fast enough forward or falling steps behind?
Am I keeping pace with my own voice or with words that are not mine?
Is it compromise or sacrifice is the path of truth one line?
Which is justice which is pain? Is it past that will define?

Every breath take is a choice
Every look I see a vision
With every step I take I move…move into a new direction.

So pack your emotional baggage if you're going for this ride
My bags are packed already they are right below my eyes
My eyes are seeing clearly what is music what is noise
I have no maps there are no signs you'll have to trust your voice.

Every breath take is choice
Every look I see a vision
With every step I take I move…move into a new direction.",Directions

I reached far into my fear and doubt.
I reached out,

From my family and friends in the hopes of finding new identity,

I reached out,

in my darkest days this distance stays.
I reached out, 
I reached out, 
I reached out.

Could you be my passion? 
Could you be my wheel? 
Can you take me to a place and make me feel apart 
Of something that is not alone? 
Can you wrap me in your warmth?
Will you take me home?

I'll reach out, 
I'll reach out, 
And when I find what it's all about.

Antennas to Heaven,"Redlight flickers in the dark
Throwing her electric shapes on the screen
A world of tiny colored spots
A world lacking that final dimension
And he watches, over tables and drawers that aren't his
He watches her flicker, illuminate, glance down at him from mounted on the wall
He watches because he trusts it
He trusts the walls without pictures and the surfaces without photographs
He trusts the sound of a zip over that of a door
He trusts the lock and key not being his
And the faceless cards that would let anybody in if they chose
Because he chose
He chose
She speaks only in silence
Without words, her mere presence is a sound
A dull hum that is there but not
She is only redlight
While he is emptiness
A card with a printed name
An unsigned dotted line

An empty mini bar
A forgotten badge crumpled on a forgotten lapel
But he has redlight every night
Redlight, wallpaper and minty breath
Because in the morning she is always gone
And then he has to ABC 1 his way to the car with a smile
And he will find foreign roads
And speak to static with a finger in his ear
He will find painted smiles that don't sign
And cheap wit cards to be crumpled in his wallet
He will drink spirits from paper cups
He will drink and laugh at the third dimension of the bar
And let the bar staff read his name to feel at home
He will find all of this and nothing else
He will find it and he will trust it
He will find it and he will trust it
He will find it and he will trust it

Dancing on the wall
She's feeling stranger now
Why she's standing tall
Way too tall for him to handle
Next to the very small candle
That's burning tonight
To make it allright
He felt me ???? and then he said
Take me, all of me
Take me, all of me

And starts to laugh
She wonders how they'll find their way back
And should they ponder it together
Or sit and stand around forever
Is this how it is
Or is that how it was
She danced instead
And then she said
Take me, all of me
Take me, all of me

And your mystic drug
I taste immune
But make him come
Undecided she steps in the unknown
Now she's there
It feels like home

She takes and hides it all away
With a jumpy heart

Is there somewhere you can tell me?'

I watched her as she walked away
My mind was still numb by her leaving
I guess for I thought of nothing to say

And a moment from now as her footsteps
[Incomprehensible] like the echo of her last goodbye
Then I'll start reliving my yesterdays
While all my tomorrows die

I should have known better
But I took the chance
And I loved her with all of my heart
What else could I do when even her glance
Pretend to tear me apart

And to live day by day
Knowing she won't return
It's useless, I won't even try
So I'll start reliving my yesterdays
While all my tomorrows die

Anthony Armstrong Jones,"I was born and raised down in Alabama
On a farm way back up in the woods
I was so ragged that folks used to call me Patches
Papa used to tease me about it
'Cause deep down inside he was hurt
'Cause he'd done all he could

My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hands, see
Education he never had
He did wonders when the times got bad
The little money from the crops he raised
Barely paid the bills we made

For, life had kick him down to the ground
When he tried to get up
Life would kick him back down
One day Papa called me to his dyin' bed
Put his hands on my shoulders
And in his tears he said

He said, Patches
I'm dependin' on you, son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you

Two days later Papa passed away, and
I became a man that day
So I told Mama I was gonna quit school, but
She said that was Daddy's strictest rule

So every mornin' 'fore I went to school
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on
I wanted to leave, just run away from home
But I would remember what my daddy said
With tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed

He said, Patches
I'm dependin' on you, son
I tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest

Then one day a strong rain came
And washed all the crops away
And at the age of 13 I thought
I was carryin' the weight of the
Whole world on my shoulders
And you know, Mama knew
What I was goin' through, 'cause

Every day I had to work the fields
'Cause that's the only way we got our meals
You see, I was the oldest of the family
And everybody else depended on me
Every night I heard my Mama pray
Lord, give him the strength to make another day

So years have passed and all the kids are grown
The angels took Mama to a brand new home
Lord knows, people, I shedded tears
But my daddy's voice kept me through the years

Sing,
Patches, I'm dependin' on you, son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you

Oh, I can still hear Papa's voice sayin'
Patches, I'm dependin' on you, son
I've tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest

I can still hear Papa, what he said
Patches, I'm dependin' on you, son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you",Patches
Anthony Armstrong Jones,"On a quiet street
In the city
A littleold man walked along
Shufflin' thru the autumn afternoon
And the autumn leaves reminded him
Another summer's come and gone
He had a lonely night ahead
Waitin' for June

Then among the leaves
Near the orphan's home
A piece of paper caught his eye
And he stooped to pick it up with trembling hands
As he read the childish writing
The old man began to cry
'Cause the words burned inside of him
Like a brand

Whoever finds this I love you
Whoever finds this I need you
I ain't even got no one to talk to
So whoever finds this I love you

The old man's eyes searched the orphan's home
And came to rest upon a child
With her nose pressed up against the window pane
And the old man knew he'd found a friend at last
So he waved at her and smiled
And they both knew they'd spend the winter laughing at the rain

And they did spend the winter laughing at the rain
Talkin' thru the trees and exchanging little gifts 
They'd made for each other
The old man would carve toys for the little girl
And she would draw picture for him of beautiful ladies
Surrounded by green trees and sunshine
And they laughed a lot
But then on the first day of June
The little girl ran to the fence to show
The old man a picture she had drawn
But he wasn't there
And somehow the little girl knew he wasn't coming back
So she went back to her little room
Took a crayon, piece of paper and wrote:

Whoever finds this I love you
Whoever finds this I need you
I ain't even got no one to talk to
So whoever finds this I love you
",Whoever Finds This I Love You
Anthony Ashur,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear
Anthony B,"There was a little boy once upon a time
Who in spite of his young age and small size knew his mind
For every copper penny and clover he would find
Make a wish for better days the end of hard times
For no more cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet 

His clothes were always clean
His face was always scrubbed
There was food on the table enough to fill him up
His house was full of life - His house was full of love
But when winter days arrived
There was never money enough to shod his cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet 

He grew up to be a worker determined to succeed
He made a life for himself, free from worldly wants or needs
But with nobody to share the life he'd made
No body to keep him warm at night
When he'd go to sleep he'd sleep alone with his cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet 

One night he walked the street looking to the heaven's above
Searching for a shooting star a benevolent God
When a woman passing by brushed his arm
He turned and found love
He then wished for the courage to ask this stranger
Who she was to not have cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet 

He thought she'd like the party life and want the finer things
So he promised more than he could buy
And he promised her the sun and moon to not have cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet 

He worked day and night his fingers to the bone
Hi worried mind guilty conscience drive him on
He can't give her what she needs
He wants to give her what he thinks she wants
Her sad-eyed face, his empty pockets drive him on and his cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet 

He'd struggled all his life to be an honest man
Proud that the dirt on his palms was the soil of the land
But some guys he knew from high school days
Said they had a plan to get rich quick
And they could count him in if he don't have cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet 

He thought about their offer accepted it without qualms
Dreamt about the life he'd buy
The comfort that would come without cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet 

He decided to tell his wife things would soon turn around
He said the little boy is dead
A man stands with you now without cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet
Without cold feet 
Cold cold cold cold feet 

He thought he'd set his clock right, He though he'd read his watch
He left in such a hurry he didn't think to wish for luck
Makes no difference if you're early, No difference if you're late
When you're out of time, The flowers have been laid
You're six feet underground
With cold feet
Cold cold cold cold feet

Yu worthless 
Pass mi sword and mi cutlass 
You think is a laughing matter this 

Verse 1: 
You a try everything you have you trap set up 
And you plan is for one brother to hate the other brother 
And slay him so Babylon can crush him cup 
It's a pity many of the youths don't realize 
That you stray them with your dollars 
Give them your killing orders 
And turn around and sell dem out just like french fries 
But here is what you do, you use the youths like dem a tool 
For doing a bag a evilous things 
But woe be on to you for turning people pickney fool 
You shatter their hopes and dreams 
You can't deny don't even try 
You are the reason why decomposed bodies are often found 
But will not be for long can't escape with all your wrong 
Countless murders committed in towns 

Chorus: 
Fi di bag a people you mek a suffer 
Fi di blood money that mek you richer 
Oh oh oh Mr. Heartless you end it a go bitter 
Shall be bitter, shall be bitter 
Fi di youths you pay fi do the murder 
Al a di body whey dem dump in a gutter 
Oh oh oh

You no waan learn 
Well nuff a dem skin get burn

Verse 2: 
Check it out many times the innocent get slay 
And you same one name the killer 
To the crime stop media 
Collect reward while sufferer grieve in pain 
Mama face the hardest time to give youths education 
And end up loosing many ways for her is only wasted days 
No chance of getting back a fraction 
So youths you need to stand up strong 
Don't take no boosting from no one 
Take this advise I give 
Don't get red eye because a money just work and earn it honestly 
Don't say that I'm talkative 
A lot of youth like you dem use and heard it often in the news 
Most wanted for killing a few 
No follow them and loose your soul 
Just keep you cool nuh loose control 
Like others they will shake you up too 

Chorus: 
Fi di bag a people you mek a suffer 
Fi di blood money that mek you richer 
Oh oh oh Mr. Heartless you end it a go bitter

Al a di body whey dem dump in a gutter

Until the colour of a man skin is of no more significance 
Than the color of his eyes, 
Then shall always war

Get so many busters on the West Coast
And then to say the least

And the question is asked
Do you wanna rap, scrap or blast to that nigga Daz
I'll be the first one to him em
Oh yeah, fuck B.G. Knocc Out and every nigga down with him

There's so many motherfuckers that I can include
Whose quick to blast motherfuckers in a feud
It doesn't make a difference, cuz it's about
Who's the quickest on the draw to end all existence
For instance, let's take these Ruthless fools
These Ruthless fools and the Pound in one room
Assume, it's only for conversation, so let's
Conversate slip a nigga the .38 then dip
Empty out the clip
Mind on stead-trip, cuz niggas talk shit

Now if, a nigga had a prayer before a nigga died
Would the nigga be dead or would he stay alive
And if I was in your shoes, would I survive
Probably not, you'd probably let your Glock go pop
Now drop, to your knees
And picture Dat Nigga Daz flowing in the breeze

Now what would you do
If you could fuck with me and my crew
But you can't so don't even think about
Steppin in the motherfuckin house

From the twitch of the eyes
You can see the line, just know it when you see it
Cause it messes up the flow, to the real fillings y'know
And I'd rather be sipping on a glass of wine
Can you feel yourself in the room with Everlast
Trying to steal a flow, I don't think so
Cock-blockers come with their hearts beating jealousy
Then away like a stray dog
Tryin to claim every bitch as his own
Cock-blockers, come in every color
Even blue, now this is true
Trying to fuck your woman, and even you
Now what the fuck would you do, motherfucker",What Would U Do?

I only know they tell me that love is grand, and
The thing that's known as romance
Is wonderful, wonderful

Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

The moon is my light of love
In the night, I am quite a romancer

To being me consolation, you're my inspiration
This is my imagination.

Nothing but love in view, then you fall

I could live without love
Now I must admit,

And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me
Because I'm sentimental over you

Anthony Braxton,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Anthony Braxton,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You
Anthony Braxton,"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

I would be, caught in the undertow

Anthony Braxton,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Anthony Braxton,"Gee, how I miss
Your tender kiss,
And the wonderful things we would do.

And miss it each night and day

I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Steals across the meadows of my heart

You wander down the lane and far away

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?",Over the Rainbow
Anthony Callea,"When you're weary, feeling small
When tears are in your eyes, I will dry them all
I'm on your side when times get rough
And friends just can't be found

[Chorus]
Like a bride over toubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you
I will take your part when darkness comes
And pain is all around

[Chorus]

Sail on silver girl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine
If you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind

Anthony Callea,"You're an obsession now,
Night after night I think of you,
A little mysterious, 
You're hot like the sun but you're cool like the moon

It would be easier, 
If I could only read your mind, 
Not knowing is killing me, 
Are you trying to be cruel 'coz I'm dying inside

[CHORUS]
Do you know what you're doing when you walk like that, 
Do you mean what you're saying when you talk like that, 
Did you steal my heart 'cause you knew you could, 
How could something feel so good, 
When it hurts so bad

Are you insatiable, 
How many hearts are on your list, 
When will you let me know, 
Am I touching your soul when I'm kissing your lips

Do you believe in love, 
Or are you making other plans, 
You're making it hard for me,
I know what I'm feeling but I don't understand

[CHORUS]
Do you know what you're doing when you walk like that, 
Do you mean what you're saying when you talk like that, 
Did you steal my heart 'cause you knew you could, 
How could something feel so good, 
When it hurts so bad

What can I do to make you understand, 
You've got to know you're my one and only, 
You're all I need baby, all that I have, 
How can it hurt so bad

Do you know what you're doing when you walk like that,

Anthony Callea,"Oh yeah
The magic's there, it's never felt so right
There's nothing better than you by my side
How did I find you, sometimes fate is kind
Two hearts connected, we are intertwined
Subconscious minds
Displaying omens
Just waiting for a sign
(Chorus)
I want you
That's all I know
So hold me close
And don't let go
I want you
That's all I know
So hold me close
Don't ever let go
I want you
Let's make it special, make it last all night
Stay in this moment till the morning light
Don't have to worry, no such thing as time
I'll give you kisses that are so sublime

Displaying omens

The clouds are warning,
Every day feels the same, 
You check the forecast 
How long can this last, 
We're gonna drown in this rain

Gotta get away, get in your car or just catch a plane,
Gotta feel the ocean spray, lets just sail away, 
Gotta feel the sun, gotta feel the sun

And all that you're thinking,

Anthony Callea,"We started out as friends
Then something happened inside me
Now I'm reading into everything
But there's no sign you hear the lightning
And you don't even notice me turning on my charm
Or wonder why I'm always where you are
(Chorus)
I've made it obvious
Done everything but sing it
(I've crushed on you so long but on and on you get me wrong)
I'm not so good with words
And since you never notice the way we belong
I'll say it in a love song
I heard you talk about
How you want someone just like me
But everytime I ask you out
We never move past friendly
And you don't ever notice how I stare when we're alone
Or wonder why I keep you on the phone
(Chorus)
You are my very first thought in the morning
(and the last one at night)
You are the love that came without warning
I need you, I want you to know
I've made it obvious
So finally I'll sing it
I'm not so good with words
And since you never notice the way that we belong
I'll say it in a love song
I'll sing it until the day you're holding me
I've wanted you for so long but on and on you get me wrong
I more than adore you and since you never seem to see
I'll say it in a love song",Obvious
Anthony Callea,"I can't say that nothings broken
Can't tell you I'm not wrong
The hardest word has been unspoken
On our lips for way too long
If you need a place to go
To know that this is true

(Chorus)
Take it to the heart for real
Take it to the place where love can heal
I'm ready to go there
I'm ready to give up everything for this
Take it to the heart for keeps
Don't stop until it's only you and me
There's nothing I won't do
Just let me show you
Here and now
Take it to the heart
Burning nights and days of thunder
Baby that's the way we are
This craziness can't pull us under
If we let it go too far
If you need a place to go
To know that this is true

Anthony Callea,"When you were my girl, there were times you'd look at me
And I knew exactly how it felt to be loved
When you were my girl, I don't know if I told you
But whenever I'd hold you, it scared me so much

You were all that I needed, you were all that I had
The one I could turn to when the world had gone mad
And I guess I just wanted
For you to know that

Not a day goes by, I don't think of you
(Do you ever think of me when you're alone)
Or I don't ask myself why
(Do you ever wonder how things could have gone)
If everything's so perfect now
(Do you ever think of me and start to cry)
Why do I cry all the time?

I didn't cry
When you were my girl
When you were my girl

When I was your man, if I took you for granted
Please understand it was my foolish heart
Girl, you were my best friend, baby, your love complete me
I loved you completely just as you are

And if you couldn't feel that then how I regret
That I never told you all the things I should've said
But I guess that's the one chance
That I'll never get

Not a day goes by, I don't think of you
(Do you ever think of me when you're alone)
Or I don't ask myself why
(Do you ever wonder how things could have gone)
If everything's so perfect now
(Do you ever think of me and start to cry)
Why do I cry all the time?

I didn't cry
When you were my girl
When you were my girl

And now I'm walking this world without you
And with every step I take
I find out every day
How much further my heart can break, oh, yeah

I don't understand why
We let something so beautiful
Just fade and die
We should have tried

One more time
When you were my girl
When you were my girl
",When You Were My Girl
Anthony Callea,"I call sleep. I can't think
I don't know what's wrong with me
I see you. within me
0r am I just imagining
A vision of how we could have been now
But I only see me somehow
I'm falling so far
What we're leaving behind is in the back of my mind
'cause I'm addicted to you

[Chorus]
Lets take it right from the start
Can't bare us to be apart no more
Don't walk away from me now
Can't lose the love that I found
I'll promise you no more tears, or fears
Just give me a chance to show you now
How my love can change your heart

Don't you see me
Why can't it be like it used to be
A light shines in my night
Its the promise of everything that we could've been
Its come apart at the seams
I'm living inside my head, I don't care what's said
'cause you've opened my heart
Don't you tear me apart

How my love can change your heart

Can't you remember baby all the love we shared
It's hurting me to think that you're no longer here
I couldn't keep you near me
I sat down and cleared my mind
And told myself it's just a matter of time
Yeah
'cause I'm addicted to you

And keeping me warm
This sadness keeps me company 
As soon as you're gone 
All the promises we made
That we never dreamed we'd break

[Chorus]
I'll forget everything I knew
Almost a perfect life with you 
Memories shine and fade away 
We were so close, we were almost 
Until the darkness turns to light
I'll get through today but not tonight 
Almost a perfect life with you 
We were so close, we were almost 

I know I must move on from here 
Don't think of the past
Sometimes there's no amount of love 
That can make it last 
All the feelings that we shared 
That we'll never have again

And now I've got no one to run to 
We'll always know we were so close

Here I am miles from where your heart beats

[Chorus]
All I ever felt was power from you
Our rhythm of life all that I ever knew 
All I'm feeling is the nothing inside 
That leaves me incomplete 

Your heart beats a sunset 
At the end of the day 
I wait here in the darkness 
For your heartbeat 
To come back again 
Don't know which turn 
What road to take
'Cause I only ever needed one way to run
Here I am miles from where your heart beats

Come back, I don't know how to live without you 
Impossible, I won't make it through 
Come back, I know I'm gonna fall without you 
I feel so incomplete
With no heartbeat, it's frozen 
It shivers, one last time 
And I don't know which turn 
What road to take

I Keep making true same mistakes 
Here I go again
Why do I put myself through this pain
Isn't it a shame
You don't feel this way

I'm used to imagining you here beside me 
Though I am all alone I hear your words whisper

If only they knew, I wouldn't have to lie 
When I look at you, with that other man 
How I'd wish you'd understand

Its been playing tricks on me again 
It hides every piece of the puzzle
I find them but it's too late by then
I hear your heart has been mending
The truth is the hardest thing to take and I miss you today 

[Chorus:]

If only I could see you now
If only you could be here in my arms 
How can you find someone 
But lose the one thing you wanted 
Wanted the most
And all these walls are built so high 

I will climb
(If only I could see you, If only I could see you now)
I will climb
(If only I could see you, If only I could see you now)

Blinded by all of the bright lights
Still I can't help see your face 
Where are you now my baby 
You are the one thing I can't replace 
I hear your doin much better 
I'm lying here lonely, make this right 
I miss you tonight

",If Only
Anthony Callea,"No, no one lives for love
How can we go on
When no one lives for love
And though we see the world is falling down around us 
Why can't we see, it's you and me 
Alone, is the sun without the rain to carry on 
Is the heart without the love to keep it warm 
Where did we go wrong, where did we go wrong 
What if this life we live, is a chance for us to give 
What if dreams were made to show the way 
How can we survive, when we push the love aside 
Only God can save us now this night I pray 
No one lives for love
Someone tell me why 
No one lives for love
We must realise, that no one lives for love
When all the beauty of the world is all around us 
Why can't we see it's you and me
And now, as your soul becomes the rain that's falling down
I pray, that we, we can learn to live for love the way 
God has shown us, through your life his, love will find a way
Through your life, we've all learned to live for, love

Anthony Callea,"I walk these streets alone
I see the world around me changing
I'm in a dream
Faces that I knew
Are slowly turning into strangers
I've never seen
I read each line I turn the page
I laugh and cry at this true story
It's time for a new chapter to begin

Why does love fall easily for some
When will it ever come to me
How do I show you what burns inside my heart
I'm not just who you want me to be, to be

I hide out here sometimes
I watch the sunlight leave the skyline
Here I am safe
I close my eyes and sleep
Tomorrow brings another journey
That I will take
I read each line like it's the last
I know this book, this time has passed
I need a new chapter to begin

Do you tell a white lie 'cause it's easy

Day after night and night after day
All my life I try to do better
Show me the way

[Chorus:]
I see it right now, no turning back
I found all the signs for the wrong direction
I am at the crossroads again
This time I know I'm not the same
And maybe it's alright to make a perfect mistake

Do you hurt the ones that you love
Words that were said you didn't mean it
Told too many lies like I did
Have you walked from the scene of the crime
Stole somebody's secret and blown it
It'll come back and get me sometime
'cause I make perfect mistakes
Day after night and night after day
All my life I try to do better
Show me the way

I don't wanna be falling down like an angel
And the devil takes me when I'm weakest
When I'm lost, confused, when I wanna change my name
But this time I refuse to feel ashamed

All my life I try to do better

Cold turkey, you can't expect me to quit, do you baby?
Cold turkey, feelings don't go away so easy
Just a little more time and I swear I'll leave you alone
But tonight I got this jones coming down

I'm finding out real quick, I just can't have anybody in my bedroom
'Cause when I want it, it's got to be you right
And though I threw away your number and I tried not to remember
Got it locked inside my brain memorized, showing off

Don't tell me that you don't recall all the fun that we used to have
And how I used to make you laugh and cry sometimes sugar
Now, I don't believe you when you say
That you ain't really thinking about me
'Cause baby girl you're steadily running through my mind
And I can't, I can't go

Cold turkey, you can't expect me to quit now baby
Cold turkey, feelings don't go away so easy
Just a little more time and I swear I'll leave you alone
But tonight I got this jones coming down

It keeps calling me right back, I keep thinking about the past
I don't wanna be with nobody but you, no man
I miss your rhythm and groove miss, don't know how you do it
All I know is I'm addicted to your love
And I can't go

Cold turkey, you can't expect me to quit, do you baby?
Cold turkey, feelings don't go away so easy
Just a little more time and I swear I'll leave you alone
But tonight I got this jones coming down
Understand what I'm saying

Cold turkey, you can't expect me to quit now baby
Cold turkey, feelings don't go away so easy
Just a little more time and I swear I'll leave you alone
But tonight I got this jones coming down, coming down
Coming down, coming down, coming down, coming down",Cold Turkey
Anthony David,"Oh hey hey this goes out to,
You really do think that you can do anything that you wanna do
Your protecting us from crime but 
Who's protecting us from you yea

24 hour patrol around the block 
Never stops the drugs from comin' in comin' in 
Yea it kind makes me wonder sometimes just who's really deliverin'
Always harassin' me and askin' me for my ID 
But I ain't done nothin' so you ain't seein' nothin' no 
Packed me a bag of buddah but I ain't the high school shootah

Anthony David,"She moved into my old apartment
That's how we got this whole thing started
She called and said that I had mail waiting there for me
I told her that I'd come and get it
How could I know in just a minute
That I'd be standing face to face with my own destiny
Oh, and we sat there talkin' just like we were old friends
Oh, then I ask her can I see you again

She said, 'Yes'
'N I said wow
I said how about right now
Love can't wait
'N I asked if she believed in fate
And she said, 'Yes'

The days flew by like a fast train
Nothin' else has been on my brain
Except the thought of how she makes me the man I want to be
She's the one I want for a million reasons
And loving her is just like breathin'
It's easy and it's obvious she was made for me
Oh, then it happened one night lookin' into her eyes
And when I popped the question much to my surprise

She said, 'Yes'
'N I said wow
I said how about right now
Love can't wait
'N I asked if she believed in fate
And she said, 'Yes'

So I called the preacher, family, and friends
And nothin's been the same since

She said, 'Yes'
'N I said wow
I said how about right now
Love can't wait
'N I asked if she believed in fate
And she said, 'Yes'",Yes
Anthony David,"It's the truth
If you told me last year I'd be laid up like this man
I would have never believed you
Things are a lot different

Seems like it was just a year ago
I was talking sleek about girls
About the little things they do to just piss me off, oh yeah
I was better off alone

I became numb and insensitive
Started being bitter and cold
Tuning in and listening to pimps on the radio and you know
It started making sense to me

But that's when I met my lady
Woman came and changed the game
Happy that I found my lady
And my life would never be the same, oh yeah

Wasn't even looking to fall in love
Was the last thing on my mind
Didn't see it coming till it already had me down
Struck me blind

I was on the verge of being through with the pain
Didn't see a reason to try
Couldn't understand what all these fools kept singing about
'Till I became one of them

When I became your lady
Everything started to change
Happy I became your lady
Life can never be the same

That's when I found my lady
And I've changed the way I think of things
Happy that I found, happy that I found
Nothing in the world can change the way I feel about you baby
Feel so good baby, don't you ever go away",Lady
Anthony David,"[Chorus]
Smoke one with your folk
Drink one with ya boy
I know it's been a little while
Since we had a little fun
Smoke one with your folk
Drink one with ya boy
I know it's been a little while
Since we had a little fun

Fancy running into you again
At this place, at this time
All the memories are rushing back again

My old friend, how you been doing, yeah?
Somebody told me that you lived down here
Somebody told me you bought a crib down here
Maybe I could check it out, I could swing by the house
Maybe I could talk you into doing something bad

[Chorus]

Hey, we can do some of the things we used to do
Or we can put our heads together
And come up with something new, yeah

All I want to do tonight is get next to you
We can make up for lost time
Share what's happening in our lives

I know some things change
But some things stay the same
Like the magic that occurs whenever we meet

The way you move, the way you dance
The way you smell, indeed divine
Some things do get better with time

Anthony David,"How, how can it be
That a love carved out of caring
Fashioned by fate, could suffer so hard
From the game played much too often

And making mistakes
Is a part of life's imperfections
Born of the years, it's not so wrong
To be human after all

Drawn into the stream
Of undefined illusion
Those diamond dreams
They can't disguise the truth

And there is something about you, baby, so right
I couldn't be without you, baby, tonight

If ever our love was concealed
No one could say that
You didn't feel a million things
In a perfect dream of life

Gone, fragile but free
We remain tender together
Not so in love, it's not so wrong
We're only human after all

These changing years
They add to your confusion
Oh, when you need to hear
The time that told the truth

There is something about you, baby, oh so right
Don't wanna be without you here tonight
And there is something about you, baby, oh so right
Don't wanna be without you here tonight

And there is something about you, baby, oh tonight
Don't wanna be without you here tonight

(Something about you, baby, oh so right)
It's what makes the world go round
It's what makes the rivers flow and
(Don't wanna be without you here tonight)

It's what makes the sparrows sing, and
It's what makes the flowers grow, and
(Something about you, baby, oh so right)

It's what gives the babies breath, and
It's what gives the sun its shine

It's what makes the Phillies play",Something About You
Anthony David,"She was in love with you
You knew it from the first day
Thought it was cute the way you played
Your little pimp game
And now it's different
'Cause she just won't leave you alone, yeah

You've got to understand
That women don't like to play
She just can't cut off her emotions
In the same way
Don't be surprised when she's blowin' you up
On the phone, yeah

[Chorus]
Stop playin' games with her heart
You know it's a shame
The way you treated her
Stop playin' games with her heart
Grow up and be a man

You think that just because
You told her from the get go
Now that it's over
She can be like you and let go
But when she laid with you
She broke you off a piece of her spirit

She tried to tell you when you met her
How she was and
And now you're caught up
In this fatal attraction
You can't pretend that in the end
This isn't partly your fault

[Chorus: x2]

This ain't a lesson, this is something
You should already know
Hey, it just comes with maturity
You can't start a fire then get mad
When it grows out of control

No matter what I say, it's nothin' but words
Just let me prove to you what I know is real
Let me express to you the way that I feel

I believe that love is synonymous
With heaven, such a sensual bliss
The way you touch me makes this life so good
A reward at the end of the long road

Take a picture off the wall, try to reframe it
Take all the color off, try to repaint it
If you want picture perfect, well we ain't it
Because we painted our own portrait
Of me and you that could never be tainted
Because real love and bodies are colors of the spectrum
Mix a few greens with your reds and your blues
Create some new youse, then you rehang it
Start over, even though your friends gon' doubt you
And all them other niggas tryna scout you
It gets so tiring, but I'd be lying
If I said that I'd be better off without you
And when I think of walking out you
Smile in a way that make me feel like I'd be lost without you
Me and you are the only threats to us
Till death do us I'm standing next to ya, uh

Summertime's on the horizon
Little girl with a baby crying
'Cause she's got no food to eat
And it ain't that, nobody's listening
And it ain't that, nobody cares*
It's just that everybody's busy looking out for what is theirs

I'm a hustler, on the corner, making very little money
But down the block, on the other corner
This nigger's down there getting paid
What's he doing and I ain't doing?
He got clothes and fancy things
Big ole car and pretty women, watch what jealousy and envy brings
On the backstreet, that's where I live
On the backstreet, there ain't positive

Now up the block comes my man Cee-Lo say what's happening, how you feel?
He don't care about no 5 - 0 'cause he's known to keep it real
Peep what's happening down the block yo, who is down there taking mine?
Cee-Lo knows about his bizness, so he runs it down one time
He get keys straight from Miami, hooks it up and sells it cheap
You ain't getting none but O's from Sammy so your prices are too steep
But I got just the thing you need son, if you really want to win
Sun light sparkles on his gold fronts as he makes this evil grin
Take a walk on down to my crib then let me show you something new
I got loads of guns and ammo that I bought from this white dude
He could tell that I was down that I was just the man to see
And he fronted me at least a G's worth of artillery on the backstreet
That's where I live, on the backstreet, yeah
There ain't nothing positive

Now in his bedroom it's amazing, he got guns of every kind
He lights a blunt we start blazing then I picked the one that shined
It's an old school Calicola, semi auto dark as night
It's just the thing I need to make my situation tight
So he shows me how to load it since I don't know what to do
Aims towards the wall and it exploded, through this poster of Ice Cube
Upon so much devastation that it's obvious to me
That is just the thing to separate your soul from your body
On the backstreet, that's where I live
On the backstreet, yeah, there ain't nothing positive

I went home and starting plotting for my come up at midnight
In the darkest catch them slipping, take his re-up money his life
I'll just catch him as he goes out to his car to make a run
Now you can't front when you're confronted with the cold steel of a gun
When night comes and I'm moving on the creep all dressed in black
Wearing a ski mask so he won't know who just put him on his back
So I hid behind the bushes at the people's house next door
3 shots rang out from behind me and my blood began to pour, no
What? What now boy? Told you I was gonna get you boy
Thought he's gonna catch me sleeping, in your dream
Do it hurt? Let's go

Everything happened in one swift action, shit I just couldn't believe
Cee-Lo told them what was happening, I been tricked,I been deceived
And it ain't that, nobody heard it
And it ain't that, nobody cares
It's just that everybody was busy looking out for what was theirs

Non-contributing citizens, what they call the NCC
I don't really know what that means but it's what the cops called me
They don't care what happens to me, they don't miss me on the beat
All they know is that there's one less nigger
Hanging on the backstreet, where I used to live
On the backstreet, there ain't nothing, nothing,

Precious redeemer and friend

Rescue the souls of man

Hopelessly lost our way

You are the one we adore. 
You give the healing and grace our 
Hearts always hunger for 

Oh our hearts always hunger for. 
Oh mighty infinite father 
Faithfully loving your own 
Here in our weakness you find us 
Falling before your throne 

Oh were falling before your throne

I never wanted to be your only love.
I know the sting of plight hurts, it only makes matters worse
I never said I would be your only love.

Old ships, battle skies, silhouettes of skeletons
news on once the clouds are gone,
these are things that I ignite.
Old news heaven sent if heaven wasn't what it is
if all the stars fell from the storm
then this is what I've become.

I need a new relief
dressed as a new belief and then
I can try to be anything or anyone other than who I was
we never hear the dawn, it wake your roommate up
so all between the sheets wishing for anyone other than us.

Please keep your distance from me I know its hard to believe
I never wanted to be your only love.
I know the sting of plight hurts, it only makes matters worse
I never said I would be your only love.

Long locks, fuzzy dice, summer in the dead of night
some would say I had to go,
and these were things we never was.
Long cries no response, silhouettes from all my bones
still we get our heads on wrong,
cause these are things we never was.

I need a new relief
disguised as new belief and then
I can try to be anything or anyone other than who I was
and I will let you sing between your mothers sheets
and I will slip through the crack of the records that stack your bedroom wall.
Oh

Please keep your distance from me I know its hard to believe
I never wanted to be your only love
I know the sting of plight hurts, it only makes matters worse
I never said I would be your only love

Got time and a story to tell 
Started when I was nine years old 
Woke up and daddy was gone 
I started hustling and the couldn't tell me nothing 
Fronting in the hood, trying to be somebody 
My soul was on empty 
I was searching for something 
Tried to be good 
Tried to keep from trouble 
Living too fast 
Trying to make a good hustle 

Sometimes it gets rough 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Times got hard 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you gotta walk to work 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you gotta do a little dirt 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 

Wasn' really looking guess I found it 
Five foot three light brown skinned 
Coming from the university 
Lifestyle looking kind of lovely 
Didn't know she had much game 
Down to ride out, even take the train 
Even take her to a poker game 
Top notch fried chicken and sushi 
Tried to be good 
Tried to treat you like a lady 
Tried to be your friend 
Turned out that you were shady 

Sometimes it gets lonely 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Some times ain't what they seem to be 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Some times would get the best of me 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 

Well, tried to be good (I tried, I tried) 
Wanted nothing but to love somebody 
Didn't want to die young 
Steady hustling trying to feed my family 
Too scared to have kids and like daddy did 
'Cause I'm so scared of failing 
Sometimes it gets hard 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 

Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you gotta moan 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you gotta cry a little louder 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you gotta fight the pain 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you get a little worried 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you get lost out of touch 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes I think I pray a little to much

'Cause they ain't got food to eat.
How the children gonna learn,
When they gotta take turns
'Cause they ain't got books to read.
Then our babies turn to crime,
Started gettin' high
'Cause the job train's kinda slow.

'Cause ain't nobody worryin' no more, no more, no more, no more, no more.
When the tears start to fall and you can't see your way,
Just carry on, c'mon, judgment day.
You don't have to mourn, help's on the way.
'Cause ain't nobody worryin' no more, no more.

These are our precious times,
Disease taking lives,
Medicaid ran out.
Show me a weapon line,
There's a mother on the phone,
Tryin' to beat the drought.
Tell me when will this end?
All the suffering,
My faith is runnin' low.

Ain't nobody worryin' no more, no more, no more, no more, no more.

And just carry on, c'mon, judgment day.
Don't have to mourn no more, help's on the way.
'Cause ain't nobody worryin'.

Ain't nobody worryin', 
When the shots fly high and the siren starts to ring.
I said, ain't nobody worryin', 
When the kids die young and the mothers are suffering.
Ain't nobody worryin'
The black man's doing time and no one cares for him. (Nobody carin'.)
The government on the grind and tryin' to fence him in. 
(Our babies are gettin' high.)
With drugs in the schools, we need to pray again.
When will it end? Will it end? Will it end? Will it end?

'Cause ain't nobody worryin'. 
(Shots fly high and the siren starts to ring.)
Ain't nobody worryin'. 
(When the kids die young and the mothers are suffering.)
Ain't nobody prayin'. 
(when they kneel down low, all they doin is tyin' their shoe string.)
Ain't nobody worryin' no more, no more, no more, no more, no more.

When it's all said and done

Anthony Hamilton,"Its about finding a new experience with someone you never thought you meet,
Who totally turns your life around completely
Helping you get a job and keeping you off the streets, church on Sunday morning
Eventually I'm saving money
Sending my life in a new direction, now I'm friends with my old man again
Standing here wearing this wedding band I can say I knew love because of you
Say I know love

I know what love is all about
I know what love's all about

I used to think that love was just a weekend thing
The way you make me feel, sharing a moment
Of emptiness, but you see that wasn't nothing
Cause the moment she left I forgot about her, until you
Came in and you showed me what it really felt to be loved
And kissed, and held, and prayed for, and
Wanted, and nurtured and guided, and ohh to be understood

I know what love is all about
I know what love's all about

I know I can sit here and I can talk about it cause I've experienced it
And I'm feelin' it, I'm livin' it
Right here right now
I got somebody who loves me for me
Got somebody who loves me for me
I know sometime I have to realize that sometimes its about compromise
And you can't always have your
Way, cant always have it your way,
Love is about realizing and love is about redirecting your discisions
Whether to go out all night long or go home to the one you love
Its about taking care of your family, and
Taking care of your kids, and holding your wife at night
And letting her know that the bills will be paid
On time and that you look and you listen to her cause its about love, say love, say love",I Know What Love's All About
Anthony Hamilton,"How could I ever hide what I felt
How could you ever say you never knew
All along it was there on my mind in my heart, 
It was the feeling, I was in love.
You act as if you never knew my name, 
How could you treasure puttin' me through so much pain, 
Like a child in the womb I needed you to give me love 
I miss that feeling of being loved

[Chorus]
How could I ever love again
How could I start to love again
After you broke me down, 
Its hard to trust that feeling, 
To fall in love again

A man don't usually fall no more then twice 
And if he does you'll never know cause he wont say,
For the fear of being fooled taken twice by the heart, 
It's in his nature, to be afraid, he starts to
Wonder if its really right, 
To let his past take control of his life, 
Maybe I'll run into hope, someone
That's right for me, 
And she'll love freely and fall in love again

[Chorus]

Love
You know what they say about a man its hard for him to fall in love
Love
Once hurt he'll never give in its hard for him to trust
Love
Bowing down it was hard to cope, 
When ya love broke down on me it was hard for me to trust again

[Chorus]",Never Love Again
Anthony Hamilton,"Another day
Chance to make another chance
A fragile place
Running on empty
A smile so faint
Barely even breaks the space

His word alone is what has kept me
Born the Son, King of eternal peace

Anthony Hamilton,"She had a habit tht she couldnt really stop, 
Needed money so she had to hit the block, nobody knew it so
She steady had to play a role, went to church, 
But surely tearin' up her soul, she'd repent sometimes,
Then she'd press rewind, started over messin up her life, 
Couldn't cope so she had to hit a knee slow,
Started prayin' to the lord, she was a

Preacher's Daughter
Sendin' herself the tears 
Sendin' herself the tears 

A preachers daughter so she had common sense, 
It's ashamed the way her life went, he's too busy though,
Steady savin souls, to realize he lost one of his own, 
Full of pain and stuck out in the dark, I even
Heard, her father made his mark, now she's confused, 
Now she's about to lose everything she thought she
Ever owned

My thumbs cause her life is gone and her kids are gone and 
She lost everything, and see her own father
Was a preacher but he couldnt pray for her 
Cause he was too busy prayin' for everybody else and layin'
Hands on all the women in the congregation, 
But I guess that's what goes on when you walk right and
Perfect and your whole house seems to be perfect, 
And behind closed doors, everybody suffers from some
Kind of demon but nobody knows it, until it all unveils itself, 
Your own daughter is out there locked out
In the dark she was a preachers daughter

I need you right now, I need you daddy, could
You hear me prayin', don't you hear me prayin' (she's somebody's daughter)

Oh
There used to be a little old boy
Riding my bus home from school yea
Introverted, kinda frail, didn't think much of himself, no
He used to see the pity
His mothers drunken boyfriend
Hanging out by the corner store
There was a very old lady
That used to call him baby
And in his mind this is what he heard

[Chorus]
Georgie Parker, get away
Georgie Parker, come with me
Georgie Parker, free your mind
Georgie Parker, let yourself be
Georgie Parker, come with me
Georgie Parker, oh
Georgie Parker, George

Trying to be his only friend
He wasn't open to strangers then, oh no
He turned his head and walked away
As he turned around and started to cry, ""why me?""
Stuck in the lions den
To scared to let help in
He had to make a sacrifice
He tried to cope with it
And couldn't find the strength
Can anybody tell me what Georgie did?

[Chorus]

They'll be a better place for u and me
Free your mind
Get away, follow me
Follow me, to a place
Free your mind lets go to, to a place
Where u can be free, oh Georgie
Free your mind, let yourself go the rest will follow",Georgie Parker
Anthony Hamilton,"Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Yea, yea, yeah
I'm so tired of all the love wounds
That yo you left girl when yo you went away
Sitting here fighting a battle that was over when I had to relocate
Yo you see I ain't much for letting go, no baby I gotta hold on
Cause trials, tribulations, and relationships have all made me strong

Girl I cry
These tears that I shed are the trail to bring  you home
Girl I cry
Mama told me that a mans own tears can make him strong
Girl I cry
I will sit around here and wait for  you to come home
I cry for you, I'll cry
I cry for you, I'll cry

Away from  you and a baby
Girl that's to much for me
I missed choir practice on saturday
Trying to catch the last midnight movie
See I just buried my mother
And I'll be damned if I loose you
Until time bring  you home again
This is what I'll do

Anthony Hamilton,"Oh, love, oh love, oh love
Well
I remember when I used to love someone that looked just like you
And also I can remember the smell of her sweet perfume
She used to tell me things that I used to love
She had a way of getting the best of my heart
And also she had a way of keeping me smiling
But now she's gone

I used to love someone, but now I'm on the run
She had a hold on me, slipping the walls of my heart

Also I can remember the first day that you came in my life
(Came into my life)
It seemed then that you were a little more open with all of your thoughts
In them days you used to talk to me

But now I don't know who you really are
It seems that the look of your eyes is that you're driftin' off from afar
And you don't even seem the same
It's like you're playing a game with me

I used to love someone, but now I'm on the run
She had a hold on me, slipping the walls of my heart

The love that I once knew still has a hold on me
I tried, oh I tried to love you

I used to love someone, but now I'm on the run
She had a hold on me, slipping the walls of my heart

But now I'm on the run,
She had a hold on me (had a hold on me) 
Slippin' my heart
And I don't know what made me do it
Something came along and blew it
I used to love someone, now I'm on the run
Used to love.. and I still, I still can't get over you
She has a hold on me

It's not that I don't love you, I just can't get over her",I Used to Love Someone
Anthony Hamilton,"Come over here
You know I've been waiting for you
To come on over here, girl
Stop playin'

Gonna take all that time
For you to come over and talk to me
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid

Come over here, whisper in my ear
Tell me something sweet, my love
While I hold you close
I want you near, don't be afraid
All the plans I made, can I propose a toast?

Here's to you
Any and every little thing
And what you mean
I'm in love with you

Why don't you come on through?
I wanna be close to you

You're the icing on the cake
A special holiday
Since I laid eyes on you
I knew you were the one

It was alright
The very first time that we kissed
Off the coast of L.A.
On my way to North Carolina

You reminded me
Of a sweet serenade
As the music played
You sent me sailin' higher and higher

Here's to you

And ain't no telling who you with
And Every time that the phone rings

Sometimes no telling where you are

But you need and try to change your ways (change your ways)
Stop this silly masquerade
Settle down before its too late
Before you make me up and blow

Cause you stopped me from doin' somethin' awful,

All that this world is offerin'.

I was thinkin' I was so fucked up,
How my old lady packed on up,
And took everything,
Left me in church beggin' for the offering,

Never thought I'd have to kiss so much ass,
Survivin' off of bread and molasses,
I'm glad I had an angel and a dream,
And I'm so tired of smokin' weed.

I heard a voice and I called out your name,
As a speeding cab pulled off from me,
From me

And I don't know when,
I'll see you again,
Hopefully soon,
In old magnolia's room where I will be waiting

You picked up packed up didn't go real far,
Maybe your resting on the other side of town,
Hopefully waiting to be found,
Be found,

Fly cross the widest sea,

There ain't nothin' in the world,
I won't give to make you happy,

To be by your side,
Only if it will bring you home to me

The distraction that you made
Keeping me from moving on
Piecing back my life

You woke up my heart

'Cause her heart, her heart wont let me lose her
No matter how I try
I just cant say goodbye and lose her

When all the folks were said and done
You were there to welcome me home
I was convicted cause your love never wavered
I know you love me more than me
And you vowed to love through anything
I never had a kind of love that was forever

You woke up my heart

Take a stick and knock it off
Pop goes the weasel

Up and down the city road
In and out of the eagle
That's the way the money goes
Pop goes the weasel

Half a pound of tuppenny rice
Half a pound of treacle
Mix it up and make it nice
Pop goes the weasel

You know, pop goes the weasel
For years, I've wondered
What that meant
And nobody seemed to know

So, I looked it up
And the official explanation
Goes something like this

Pop goes the weasel refers to
The habit of London hatters long ago
Popping or pawning their weasels
Or accessories on Saturday night
To buy liquor, isn't that interesting

Up and down the city road
In and out of the eagle
That's the way the money goes
Pop goes the weasel

But you know
I've got a theory of my own
About pop goes the weasel
It's much simpler

Why did the weasel go pop, go pop
Pop, pop goes the weasel
Why did the weasel go pop
'Cause they upped the price
Of tuppeny rice to four pence

How did the pop get into the weasel
Weasel, pop goes the weasel
How did the pop get in there
Well, the weasel caught his
Beakle in the treacle

Now, if you've got a weasel
And you don't want him to pop
The next time you go shopping
Don't you take him in the shop
Two, three, four

Half a pound of tuppenny rice
Half a pound of treacle
Now that is the way
That the money goes
Pop goes the weasel

Every night, when I go out
The weasel's sitting on the table
Now I take a stick
And I knock it off
Pop goes the weasel

Up and down the city road
In and out of the eagle
That's the way the money goes
Pop goes the weasel

Together now

Half a pound of tuppenny rice
Half a pound of treacle
Now, I mix it up
And I make it nice
Pop, pop, pop goes the weasel

Pop, pop, pop goes the weasel
Poppity, poppity, pop
Goes the weasel now

Would you excuse me for a moment
I'm just gonna pop my weasel",Pop Goes the Weasel
Anthony Newley,"You are too beautiful, my dear, to be true
And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling that because I have found you
I could have bound you too
You are too beautiful for one man alone
For one lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs
If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you
It's not through a sense of duty
You are too beautiful
And I am a fool for beauty

You are too beautiful

Anthony Newley,"I don't ever care to rise to power
I would rather be with you an hour
For the things that one can buy
Are not worth a lover's sigh

I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart
In my heart I have but one desire
And that one is you, no other will do

I've lost all ambition for worldly acclaim
I just want to be the one you love
And with your admission that you feel the same
I'll have reached the goal I'm dreaming of, believe me

I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart",I Don't Want to Set the World in Fire
Anthony Newley,"This is a camp that is a-mighty tough
Were the marchin' men are made
But I am a guy who doesn't dig that stuff
And I'm idle on parade

There is a man, a Sergeant-Major Lush
And he has got to be obeyed (Yeah!)
And in a voice just like a little thrush
He says I'm idle on parade

Now, when they gave me a rifle, well they went too far
I'm much better off when I got a guitar
I told the C.O. that I wanna be sent
He sent me to a place where I could repent

When I was a-free, I was a crazy pup
Rock-a-boogie was my trade
Now Captain Burton-Bassett says I'm all shook up

Now that you left me
How can I live through another day
Watching my dreams turn into ashes
And all my hopes into bits of clay
Once I could see, once I could feel
Now I am numb
I've become unreal

I walk the night, oh, without a goal
Stripped of my heart, my soul

I feel the world closing in on me
Here come the stars
Tumbling around me
And there's the sky where the sea should be

Anthony Newley,"There's a fruit store on our street
It's run by a Greek.
And he keeps good things to eat
But you should hear him speak!
When you ask him anything, he never answers ""no"".
He just ""yes""es you to death, and as he takes your dough
He tells you
""Yes, we have no bananas
We have-a no bananas today.
We've string beans, and onions
Cabbageses, and scallions,
And all sorts of fruit and say
We have an old fashioned to-mah-to
A Long Island po-tah-to
But yes, we have no bananas.
We have no bananas today.""

Business got so good for him that he wrote home today,
""Send me Pete and Nick and Jim; I need help right away.""
When he got them in the store, there was fun, you bet.
Someone asked for ""sparrow grass"" and then the whole quartet
All answered
""Yes, we have no bananas
We have-a no bananas today.
Just try those coconuts
Those walnuts and doughnuts
There ain't many nuts like they.
We'll sell you two kinds of red herring,
Dark brown, and ball-bearing.
But yes, we have no bananas
We have no bananas today.""

Yes, we are very sorry to inform you
That we are entirely out of the fruit in question
The afore-mentioned vegetable
Bearing the cognomen ""Banana"".
We might induce you to accept a substitute less desirable,
But that is not the policy at this internationally famous green 
grocery.
I should say not. No no no no no no no.
But may we suggest that you sample our five o'clock tea
Which we feel certain will tempt your pallet?
However we regret that after a diligent search 
Of the premises
By our entire staff
We can positively affirm without fear of contradiction
That our raspberries are delicious; really delicious
Very delicious
But we have no bananas today.

Yes, we gotta no banana
No banana
We gotta no banana today.
I sella you no banana.
Hey, Marianna, you gotta no banana?
Why this man, he no believe-a what I say.
Now whatta you want mister?
You wanna buy twelve for a quarter?
No? well, just a oneofadozen?

Just like a leaf thart has blown away.
Gone with the wind,
My romance has flown away.

Are still on my lips,
I found a lifetime of heaven
At my fingertips.

But now all is gone,
Gone is the rapture that filled my heart.

Will the nights bring another to me?
Not your kind,
But let me find
It's not true that love is blind.

Sun shines around me,
But deep in my heart it's cold as ice!
Love, once you found me,
But can that story unfold twice?

Stirring to sing love's magic music,
Then forget the old duet

Love is a spark lost in the dark,

Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

That comes with each new love affair
The dreams that we cherish, so often might perish
And leaves you with castles in air

When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies

What lonely hours, with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything

Never any symphony
