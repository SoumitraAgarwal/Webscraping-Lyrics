Genesis,"Hot sun beating down
Burning my feet just walking around.

Hot sun making me sweat
Gators getting close, hasn't got me yet

[Chorus]
I can't dance, I can't talk.
Only thing about me is the way I walk.
I can't dance, I can't sing
I'm just standing here selling everything.

Blue jeans sitting on the beach,
Her dog's talking to me, but she's out of reach.

She's got a body under that shirt,
But all she wants to do is rub my face in the dirt.

Cause, I can't dance, I can't talk.
Only thing about me is the way I walk.
I can't dance, I can't sing
I'm just standing here selling.

Oh and checking everything is in place,
You never know who's looking on.

Young punk spilling beer on my shoes,
Fat guy's talking to me trying to steal my blues.

Thick smoke, see her smiling through.
I never thought so much could happen just shooting pool.

[Chorus]

Oh and checking everything is in place
You never know who's looking on
A perfect body with a perfect face.

[Chorus]

But I can walk.
No I can't dance.
No no no I can't dance
No I said I can't sing.
But I can walk.","I Can't Dance [12"" Version]"
Genesis,"Oh yeah
You know I never wanted to be closer
And I'll still be here until it's over
No, no, I never wanted to be closer
But you'll be back; I could've told you

Well, I always knew
Yes, I could see it coming
Your ambitious streak
You always want things beyond your reach
Well, now you've got what you wanted
And you're free to be the things
You always said you'd be
You're up there looking down
Tell me, what do you see? Oh

'Cause you know
You know I never wanted to be closer
And I'll still be here until it's over
No, no, I never wanted to be closer
Yeah, but you'll be back; I could've told you

Well, it seems to me
That you've got to fight for yourself
In this world we live in
It's dog-eat-dog and never give in
Why worry when you're holding the aces?
Don't throw it away 'cause you know
I'd rather be you than me
Up there looking down
Tell me, what do you see? Oh

Hey, hey, yeah

Oh yeah
You know I never wanted to be closer (never wanted)
And I'll still be here till it's over
No, no, I never wanted to be closer (never wanted)
Oh, but you'll be back; I could've told you

It's been a long time coming
But at last we seem to be moving on, straight ahead
We're finally getting something done
Time flies and before you know it
You'll be getting closer to where
You always knew you'd be
Up there looking down
Tell me, what do you see? Oh

'Cause you know
No, no, I never wanted to be closer (never wanted)
I'll still be here until it's over
No, you know I never wanted to be closer (never wanted)

Genesis,"Well I've been waiting, waiting here so long
But thinking nothing, nothing could go wrong, ooh now I know
She has a built in ability
To take everything she sees
And now it seems I'm falling, falling for her.

She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
She reaches in, and grabs right hold of your heart
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
It takes control and slowly tears you apart.

Well I don't really know her, I only know her name
But she crawls under your skin, you're never quite the same, and now i
Know
She's got something you just can't trust
It's something mysterious
And now it seems I'm falling, falling for her.

She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
She reaches in, and grabs right hold of your heart
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
It takes control and slowly tears you apart.

She don't like losing, to her it's still a game
And though she will mess up your life,
You'll want her just the same, and now I know
She has a built in ability

Genesis,"Reach out, hands in the air
Don't care, just what they're sayin'
Hold out, just keep on hopin' against hope
That it's gonna get better

Don't worry, there's no hurry for you or for me
Everything's gonna come around
Shout out, someone will listen to you, to me
Someone's gonna see, yeah

Well, he calls me over, calls me brother
And I know, always fighting, moonlighting
Well, it never ends

In the city, if you are alone
There's a sister
Well, she's standin' next to her man
In the doorways and in the hallways and
She don't really care, it's the city
And she's all alone

So reach out, hands in the air
Don't care just what they're saying
Hold out, just keep on hoping against hope
That it's gonna get better

Don't worry, there's no hurry for you or for me
'Cause everything's gonna come around
Shout out, someone will listen to you, to me
Someone's gonna see, yeah

Well, everywhere you go you
You live in the shadows of fear
In the darkness you feel the sharpness of steel
But it's always there in the city if you are alone

So reach out, hands in the air
Don't care just what they're sayin'
Hold out, just keep on hoping against hope
That it's gonna get better

Don't worry, there's no hurry for you or for me
Cause everything's gonna come around
Shout out, someone's gonna listen to you, to me
Someone's gonna see, yeah yeah

If it's gonna get better, it starts with a feeling
If it's gonna get better, it's gonna take time
If it's gonna get better, we've gotta start now

'Cause I know, everybody can see it
And I know, everybody can feel it
And it shows in our shows, I'm not dreaming
Because you know and I know, it's time for change, yeah

You know it's gonna get better, this is gonna get better
This is gonna get better, oh, this is gonna get better, oh, oh
Know man, it's gonna get better, it's gonna get, gonna get

Genesis,"Stepping out the back way
Hoping nobody sees
Feeling can be easy
Think how I feel
What will (can) you say?
What will you do?
Why can't you see?
It's yourself I love
(Don't you know I'm not asking
 You must have made up your mind
 Is it worth the pain you're causing
 To those you're leaving behind
 What will you say?
 What will you do?
 Why can't you see?
 It's yourself I love)
Don't you know I'd like some answers
You could give me a call
I hardly know the reason
And I really feel no good at all
Where will you go?
Where will you be?
Where can I try?
It's yourself I love",It's Yourself
Genesis,"Ooh, and the man steps out in the moonlight
At the sound of a scream from below
He thinks he is a warrior
So he picks up his sword and goes

From the mouth of the monster
He rescues the maiden fair
But we know she's a demon
Come to lure him to the demon's lair

Through restless foliage
And tall trees she leads
To a house in a clearing
A place in her fear she calls home

Come with me I need you
I fear the dark and I live all alone
I'll give you wine and food too
And something special after if you like

And though his body bids him
To enter in with her
There was something in her manner
That his mind could not ignore

Also it is whispered
In the kingdom far and wide
To beware a little cottage
In the forest in a glade

For who knows what magic
Takes place in his world
So he just thanks her kindly
Preparing to go on his way

Come with me I need you
I fear the dark and I live all alone
I'll give you wine and food too
And something special after if you like

Come to my garden
Taste the fruits and the spices of love
You can't resist me
I'm the kind that your dreams tell you of

So glad you could make it
We had everything arranged
So glad you saw fit to pay a call

Some men never listen
And other never learn
But why this man did as he did
Only he will ever know

He knew he was walking
Into a waiting trap
Neatly set up for him
With a bait so richly wrapped

So he went inside there
To take on what he found
But he never escaped them
For who can escape what he desires

Come with me I need you
I fear the dark and I live all alone
I'll give you wine and food too
And something special after if you like",The Lady Lies [Live]
Genesis,"I must've dreamed a thousand dreams
Been haunted by a million screams
But I can hear the marching feet
They're moving into the street.

Now did you read the news today
They say the dangers gone away
But I can see the fires still alight
There burning into the night.

There's too many men
Too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Just tell me why
This is a land of confusion.
This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and lets start trying
To make it a place worth living in.

Ooh superman where are you now
When everything's gone wrong somehow
The men of steel, the men of power
Are losing control by the hour.

This is the time
This is the place
Where we look for the future
And there's not much love to go round
Tell me why, this is a land of confusion.
This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and lets start trying
To make it a place worth living in.

I remember long ago
When the sun was shining
Ooh and the stars were bright
All through the night
And the sound of your laughter
As I held you tight
So long ago

I wont be coming home tonight
My generation will put it right
Were not just making promises
That we know, well never keep.

Too many men
There's too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Just tell me why
This is a land of confusion.
Now this is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and lets start trying
To make it a place worth fighting for.
This is the world we live in
And these are the names we're given
Stand up and lets start showing
Just where our lives are going to.","Land of Confusion [12"" Version]"

But maybe deep down inside, I'm lyin'
To no one else but me
Oh and my back is up, I'm on my guard

There's the morning light 
Shining in your hair, and in your eyes 
 
And just a little way behind that smile of yours

If only for one second, I could hold you close to me 
When the Master calls for me again 
There's nothing I can say, or I can do 
 
Goodbye, my love

I know what I like, and I like what I know;
Getting better in your wardrobe, stepping one beyond your show.

Listen son, you're wasting your time; there's a future for you
In the fire escape trade. come up to town!
But I remebered a voice from the past;
Gambling only pays when you're winning
- I had to thank old miss mort for schooling a failure.

Genesis,"And the lamb lies down on Broadway.
Early morning Manhattan,
Ocean winds blow on the land.
Movie-Palace is now undone,
The all-night watchmen have had their fun.
Sleeping cheaply on the midnight show,
It's the same old ending - time to go.
Get out!
It seems they cannot leave their dream.
There's something moving in the sidewalk steam,
And the lamb lies down on Broadway.
Nightime's flyers feel their pains.
Drugstore take down the chains.
Metal motion comes in bursts,
The gas station can quench that thirst.
Suspension cracked on unmade road
The trucker's eyes read 'Overload'
And out on the subway,
Rael Imperial Aerosol Kid
Exits into daylight, spraygun hid,
And the lamb lies down on Broadway.
The lamb seems right out of place,
Yet the Broadway street scene finds a focus in its face.
Somehow it's lying there,
Brings a stillness to the air.
Though man-made light, at night is very bright,
There's no whitewash victim,
As the neons dim, to the coat of white.
Rael Imperial Aerosol Kid
Wipes his gun - he's forgotten what he did,
And the lamb lies down on Broadway.
Suzanne tired her work all done,
Thinks money - honey - be on - neon.
Cabman's velvet glove sounds the horn
And the sawdust king spits out his scorn.
Wonder women you can draw your blind!
Don't look at me! I'm not your kind.
I'm Rael!
Something inside me has just begun,
Lord knows what I have done,
And the lamb lies down on Broadway.

They say there's always magic in the air.",Lamb Lies Down on Broadway (Remixed by Nick Davis)

It is in between the cages, it is always in a space

Who rides the horse without a hoof
It is shaken not stirred;
Cocktails on the roof.
When you eat right through it you see everything alive
It is inside spirit, with enough grit to survive
If you think that its pretentious, you've been taken for a ride.

Out in the garden, the moon seems very bright
Six saintly shrouded men move across the lawn slowly
The seventh walks in front with a cross held high in hand
And it's hey babe your supper's waiting for you
Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true?

I've been so far from here
Far from your warm arms
It's good to feel you again
It's been a long long time
Hasn't it? 

I know a farmer who looks after the farm
With water clear, he cares for all his harvest
I know a fireman who looks after the fire

You, can't you see he's fooled you all
Yes, he's here again
Can't you see he's fooled you all?
Share his peace, sign the lease
He's a supersonic scientist
He's the guaranteed eternal sanctuary man
Look, look into my mouth he cries
And all the children lost down many paths
I bet my life you'll walk inside 
Hand in hand
Gland in gland 
With a spoonful of miracle
He's the guaranteed eternal sanctuary
We will rock you, rock you little snake
We will keep you snug and warm

Wearing feelings on our faces while our faces took a rest
We walked across the fields to see the children of the West
But we saw a host of dark skinned warriors standing still below the ground

Waiting for battle

The fight's begun, they've been released
Killing foe for peace, bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang
And they've given me a wonderful potion
'Cause I cannot contain my emotion
And even though I'm feeling good
Something tells me I'd better activate my prayer capsule

Today's a day to celebrate, the foe have met their fate
The order for rejoicing and dancing has come from our warlord

Wandering in the chaos the battle has left
We climb up the mountain of human flesh
To a plateau of green grass, and green trees full of life
A young figure sits still by a pool
He's been stamped ""Human Bacon"" by some butchery tool
He is you

Social Security took care of this lad
We watch in reverence, as Narcissus is turned to a flower
A flower? 

If you go down to Willow Farm
To look for butterflies, flutterbyes, gutterflies
Open your eyes, it's full of surprise
Everyone lies like the fox on the rocks
And the musical box
Oh, there's Mum and Dad, and good and bad
And everyone's happy to be here

There's Winston Churchill dressed in drag
He used to be a British flag, plastic bag, what a drag
The frog was a prince
The prince was a brick, the brick was an egg, the egg was a bird 
(Fly away you sweet little thing, they're hard on your tail) 
Hadn't you heard? (they're going to change you into a human being!) 
Yes, we're happy as fish and gorgeous as geese
And wonderfully clean in the morning

We've got everything, we're growing everything
We've got some in, we've got some out 
We've got some wild things floating about 
Everyone, we're changing everyone
You name them all, we've had them here
And the real stars are still to appear
(All change!) 

Feel your body melt
Mum to mud to mad to dad 
Dad diddley office, Dad diddley office
You're all full of ball
Dad to dam to dumb to mum 
Mum diddley washing, Mum diddley washing
You're all full of ball

Let me hear your lies, we're living this up to the eyes
Ooh, aah, na-na-na 
Momma I want you now

And as you listen to my voice
To look for hidden doors, tidy floors, more applause
You've been here all the time
Like it or not, like what you got
You're under the soil (the soil, the soil)
Yes, deep in the soil (the soil, the soil, the soil!)
So we'll end with a whistle and end with a bang 
And all of us fit in our places

With the guards of Magog, swarming around
The Pied Piper takes his children underground
Dragons coming out of the sea
Shimmering silver head of wisdom looking at me
He brings down the fire from the skies
You can tell he's doing well by the look in human eyes
Better not compromise, it won't be easy

666 is no longer alone
He's getting out the marrow in your backbone
And the seven trumpets blowing sweet rock and roll
Gonna blow right down inside your soul
Pythagoras with the looking glass reflects the full moon
In blood, he's writing the lyrics of a brand-new tune

And it's hey babe, with your guardian eyes so blue
Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true?
I've been so far from here, far from your loving arms
Now I'm back again
And babe, it's gonna work out fine

Can't you feel our souls ignite?
Shedding ever-changing colours
In the darkness of the fading night
Like the river joins the ocean
As the germ in a seed grows 
We have finally been freed to get back home

There's an angel standing in the sun
And he's crying with a loud voice
""This is the supper of the mighty one""

When the sun beats down and I lie on the bench,

""Jacob, wake up! You've got to tidy your room now.""
And then Mister Lewis:
""Isn't it time that he was out on his own?""
Over the garden wall, two little lovebirds - cuckoo to you!
Keep them moving blades sharp...

I know what I like, and I like what I know;
Getting better in your wardrobe, stepping one beyond your show.

Sunday night, Mr Farmer called, said:
""Listen son, you're wasting your time; there's a future for you
In the fire escape trade. Come up to town!""
But I remebered a voice from the past;
""Gambling only plays when you're winning""
- I had to thank old Miss Mort for schooling a failure.

Thinking,
Wondering what i could make of my life, and who'd be waiting,
Asking all kinds of questions, to myself, but never finding the answers,
Crying at the top of my voice, and no one listening,
All this time, i still remember everything you said
There's so much you promised, how could i ever forget.

Listen, you know i love you, but i just can't take this,
You know i love you, but i'm playing for keeps,
Although i need you, i'm not gonna make this,
You know i want to, but i'm in too deep.

So listen, listen to me,
Ooh you must believe me,
I can feel your eyes go through me,
But i don't know why.

Ooh i know you're going, but i can't believe
It's the way that you're leaving,
It's like we never knew each other at all, it may be my fault,
I gave you too many reasons, being alone, when i didn't want to
I thought you'd always be there, i almost believed you,
All this time, i still remember everything you said, oh
There's so much you promised, how could i ever forget.

Listen, you know i love you, but i just can't take this,
You know i love you, but i'm playing for keeps,
Although i need you, i'm not gonna make this,
You know i want to, but i'm in too deep.

So listen, listen to me,
I can feel your eyes go through me

It seems i've spent too long
Only thinking about myself - oh
Now i want to spend my life
Just caring bout somebody else.

There must be some kind of mistake
I waited in the rain for hours
And you were late
Now it's not like me to say the right thing
But you could've called to let me know
I checked your number twice, don't understand it
So I went home
Well I'd been waiting for this weekend
I thought that maybe we could see a show
Never dreamed I'd have this feeling
Oh but seeing you is believing
That's why I don't know why
You didn't show up that night
There must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake
I was waiting in the rain for hours
And you were late
Since then I've been running around trying to find you
I went to the places that we always go
I rang your home but got no answer

Still don't believe it

Me looking at you, you looking at me
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all

Making me feel like I want too much
Living with you's just putting me through it all of the time
Running around, staying out all night
Taking it all instead of taking one bite
Living with you's just putting me through it all of the time

I could leave but I won't go
It'd be easier I know
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes

Ich wollt', dass sich alles um mich dreht wie 'n Hula Hoop
Ich seh' auf Tour mehr Titten als im Moulin Rouge
Scooby-Dooby-Doo, du hast Angst und ich hab den Blues
Wieso mich jeder sucht? Ich bin im World Wide Web
Keiner kennt mein Gesicht, jeder hört mein' Rap
Das mit dem Fame hab ich mir anders vorgestellt
Ich fahr' die gleiche scheiß Karre, ich hab immer noch kein Geld
Ich komm' nicht mal backstage zu mei'm eigenem Auftritt
Mir ist das Lachen echt vergang', seit ich Clown bin
Rotzlöffel, Klassenclown, Rap-Superstar
Träum' davon, diverse Sportwagen cash zu bezahl'n
Aber dann holt mich mein Wecker auf den Boden der Tatsachen
Ich bin Killer und mein Mic ist meine Tatwaffe
Swing Swing so wie Frank Sinatra, my way
Have a nice day, ich will Beef und order zwei Steaks
Nach dem Album tauch' ich ab und mach 'ne Weltreise
Und wir gehen allerhöchstens unter wenn ich stagedive

Um meine Stimme zu bezwing' sind deine Boxen zu klein
Selfmade hat uns, der Rest hat Fotzen gesigned
Ich versetze mich in Trance und tanze nackt ums Feuer
Scheiß auf Navigation, denn ich bin schwanzgesteuert
Du kommst im BMW, ich im Kampfhubschrauber
Hoffentlich bleibt beim Gemetzel mein Anzug sauber
Der Bulle hält mich an - ich bleibe cool wie Sub-Zero
Unter meinem Sitz liegt 'n ganzes hasch Kilo
Er peilt nix und wünscht mir gute weitere Fahrt
Noch mal Glück gehabt, das rettet mein' Eigenbedarf

Meine Zeit ist nah, ruf ""Priester der Inka"" zu meiner Weihung
Ich bin der Messias, lauf' übers Wasser und du kniest nieder
Du kehrst ab von deinem Glauben, wirst augenblicklich zum Diener
Du hältst das für übertrieben, doch ich kenne keine Grenzen
Letzten Endes ist mein Denken durch Technik nicht zu ersetzen
Meine Neuronen sind bestens verchromt und verknüpft wie Netze
Ich bin Pharao, versklave Wörter in meinen Sätzen

Ich hab 'nen riesen IQ ih hab 'ne Knarre und du?
Ich hab 'ne Zukunft vor mir ich hab auch Kugeln dazu
Was ist, wenn man uns schnappt? Mann, ich kenn jeden im Knast
Und wenn wir draufgehen dabei? Ey, darum geht's doch, du Spast!

Hier drin wird's langsam eng, ich muss raus aus mei'm Kopf
Weil meine Kreativität mir schon aus jeder Pore tropft
Auf Papier und sie malt Bilder in Farben, die bisher keiner kannte
So entstand karuzo als Teil meiner Geisteskrankheit
Ich hab meinen Geist geteilt, weil ich dachte so bleibt er eins
Versucht's zu unterdrücken wie Dr. Jekyll und Hyde
Doch kein Medikament oder Therapie, die mich heilt
Seitdem leben wir zu zweit in ei'm Körper als Feind
Es bleibt uns nicht mehr viel Zeit
Weil ich selber noch nicht mal weiß
Wer von uns beiden diesen Text eigentlich grade schreibt
Ich sitz im Labor - heißt, natürlich nur, wenn ich Ich bin
Vielleicht bin ich auch er oder er Ich - wer will das wissen, hä?!
Was soll das werden, willst du mich etwa vernichten?
Dazu fehlen dir außer Eiern ganz nebenbei auch die Mittel
Ich erstick dein Gewissen und übernehme das Ruder
Warum wehrst du dich so sehr, akzeptier' mich endlich als Bruder
Wir sind Ying Yang, ching chang chong
Reich mir deine Hand und alle sing' dein' Song
Erspar' uns diesen Kampf, ich hätt' ihn sowieso gewonnen
Böse sein ist fantastisch, komm, Bruder, komm

Ich hab 'nen riesen IQ - Ich hab 'ne Knarre und du?
Ich hab 'ne Zukunft vor mir ich hab auch Kugeln dazu
Was ist, wenn man uns schnappt? Mann, ich kenn jeden im Knast
Und wenn wir draufgehen dabei? Ey, darum geht's doch, du Spast!

Genau genommen gibt es, glaub ich, nicht mal 'nen Grund
Aus Langeweile habe ich Gewichte gepumpt
Und der Umfang meiner Brust ist langsam nicht mehr gesund
Und in der Zelle nebenan ist es stumm
Meine Nachbarn brachte ich letzte Nacht um
Den Verstand - Jetzt sind wir auf einer Wellenlänge
Und kommunizieren telepathisch durch Zellenwände
Ich krieg nie Besuch, seitdem die mich wegsperrten
Ich verlier' die Nerven und mach Stress mit 6 Wärtern
Da gibts ne Spritze von so abgefahrenem Zeug
Und die nächsten 3 Tage bin ich vollständig betäubt
Ab und zu kommt so ne Schlampe von Psychiaterin
Und sagt, dass ich, trotz Therapie, immer noch Banane bin
Kein Plan, ob das Gelaber stimmt, Frauen halt
Fakt ist, diese Fotze verlängert meinen Aufenthalt

Ich komm hier nie wieder raus, ich werd für immer festsitzen
Die letzten Schritte werden die sein zum Elektrischen
Hinter Gittern, das ist lebenslanger Strafvollzug

Heut hab ich Freigang, ab in den Park mit 8 Beamten
Ich sitze auf der Bank und fütter die Enten und wink den Passanten
Dann gehts zurück, Block-D, ich werd abgeführt
Ohne die Fesseln hätte ich alle 8 schon massakriert
Ich habe die Bibel die Tora und den Koran gelesen
Mit dem Papst geredet mit Rabbis und zu Allah gebetet
Aber anstatt mich aufzunehmen in den Himmel
Wollte mir jeder von denen einen Auftragsmord vermitteln
Die andern Insassen trauen mir nicht über den Weg
Bis jetzt hat keiner meiner Freunde meine Freundschaft überlebt
Die Selbstmordrate meiner Mithäftlinge steigt
Wenn ich in der Nähe bin auf unerklärliche Weise
Besser du gewöhnst dich an das duschen ohne Seife
Denn wenn nicht wirst du in Zukunft nur noch Blut und Sperma scheißen

Also knock ich sie aus mit meiner knochigen Faust

Wird auch Zeit, weil ich endlich hier raus muss
Noch 'n paar Sekunden, dann werde ich Freiheit schnuppern

Vierzig Stunden Wehen, - so kündigt sich ein Rebell an
Mama war hart, man gab ihr Eisenstangen zum Draufbeißen
Ich war härter und sie mussten mich aus ihrem Bauch schneiden
Das erste was ich seh' ist also Klinge und Blut
Klingt nicht so gut, in mir wuchs dann auch ne innere Wut
Die Welt hat angefangen, sie steht nicht so auf meinen Besuch
Ich hab mir das nicht ausgesucht, ich bin ein laufender Fluch
Mein Laufstall war aus Panzerglas, ich hatte Fesseln am Fuß
Ich hatte keinen Schnuller, ich kaute am Rest eines Hufs
Und jeder hat es versucht, aber keiner hat es geschafft
Mich zu erziehen, so hab ich's leider nur zum Rapper gebracht
Und in der Schule war Stress mein Fach, Noten bis so lala
Scheissegal ich hatte großen Spaß
Die anderen waren taggen und kiffen auf der Mädchentoilette
In der Zwischenzeit hatte ich unseren Lehrer gekidnappt
Aber nicht für Lösegeld, ich wollte niemand erpressen
Ich wollte spielen und mit ihm zusammen Sandkuchen essen
Ich hab ihn gefüttert, bis er anfing Blut zu erbrechen
Ich weiß auch nicht, irgendwie ist alles was ich tu'n Verbrechen!

Wer bist du? Ich bin der, von dem sie alle reden
Die Entdeckung des Jahrzehnts, einfach der beste, der je lebte!
Was willst du? Ich will auf die Bühne und den Fame
In jeder Stadt, in der ich bin 10.000 Hände sehen!
Und warum? Kein Plan, das ist einfach in mir drin
Sich zu wehren hat keinen Sinn, ich folge einfach nur den Stimmen!
Und wofür? Den Kick, den Rausch und die Elektrizität
Die durch meinen Körper fließt und macht, das mein Herz schlägt!

Eyau Karuzo, wie viel wollt ihr für'n Feature?
Nich so viel, ich sag mal deine Seele und'n Plüschtier
Was ich wirklich will, kann man für Geld nicht kaufen
Da fällt mir ein, ich könnt 'nen neuen Pelz gebrauchen
Der Prof meint ich sei zwar sehr intelligent
Aber davon merkt man nichts, wenn ich die ganze Vorlesung penn
Und überhaupt, was macht so einer wie du an der Uni?
Das passt nicht, so wie meinem Schwanz die Standardgummis
Man wirft mir vor, ich schlage und misshandle Frauen
Das ist nicht wahr, man, ihre Augen waren schon vorher so blau
Ich bin romantisch, ich zünde dich an und fress' die Blumen
Da war doch was? Ach ja, du bezahlst die Rechnung, Hure
Im Kindergarten wollte keiner mit mir spielen
Vielleicht, weil ich es witzig fand die Mädchen an den Haaren zu ziehen
Kratzen, beißen, spucken, das war meine Disziplin
Meine Hobbys waren Streichhölzer, Kanister mit Benzin
Irgendwie hat sich bis heute nicht so sehr viel verändert
Nur trag ich in inzwischen nur noch sehr selten eine Pampers
Du bist so sehr Gangster wie Ned Flanders
Ich hab das Herz eines Mammuts und du das eines Rentners

Tut ihr's nicht, bleibt mir nix, außer euch anzuschießen

Widerspruch zur Hautfarbe, Nigga, ich kann sagen, was ich will
Deine MILF ist auf der Jagd nach meiner Milch, yeah
Ich häng' mir um den Hals Nahrungsketten
Und fall Frauen in den Rücken, zu Paarungszwecken
Ecstasy wirkt auf mich, wie eine Schlaftablette
Ich bin so high, ihr müsst auf den Mars zum battlen
Ihr habt Knarren unter'm Kissen? Ich AKs unter der Bettdecke
Ich drück' den Auslöser - Kannst du bitte nett lächeln?
Ich geh' mit 'nem Bombengürtel backpacken
Hip-Hop-Open oder Splash! wegspreng'
Überfallkommando, wie Terrormiliz, also hebt die Hand hoch
Ghostbusters, Phantom, Mission: Genozid

Wie ich wurde, was ich war, geht dich zwar eigentlich 'n Scheiß an, aber
Irgendwie fließen die Worte aus mir raus
Trag' mein Herz nicht auf der Zunge, nein, ich kau's und spuck' es aus
Was wollt ihr hören, dass meine Mom uns nicht geliebt hat?
Dass mein Vater mehr als ein Mal vor 'm Suizid stand?
Dass ich guten Herzens diesen Menschen vertraut hab'
Und dass sie dieses Vertrauen missbraucht ha'm? Einfach traumhaft, nich'?
Dass mein Vater sein' Zug damals verpasst hat
Genau wie auf der Autobahn den Laster, als es Nacht war
Dass meine Mom mir nie zeigen konnte, wie sehr
Sie mich tief drin liebt und noch heute fällt es ihr schwer
Dass ich immer das Gefühl hatte, allein zu sein
Dass ich dachte, dass wenn ich sterbe, dann keiner weint
Ich hab' gesagt, dass ihr die Story niemals kriegt
Und doch liegt sie hier vor mir auf dem Tisch

Wasser fließt bergauf und Blumen blühen ewig, ewig

Wollt ihr hören, dass ich viele Jahre ein Feigling war?
Dass ich den Schwanz eingezogen, mich nicht verteidigt hab?
Dass mein Cousin, der fast wie ein großer Bruder war
Mit gerade mal zwanzig Jahren qualvoll an seinem Tumor starb?
Dass ich als kleiner Junge von zu Hause fortlief
Ich jahrelang in Kliniken aufwachte und dort schlief?
Dass ich rappe, damit mein Vater nicht obdachlos ist
Dass ich manchmal nich' mehr kann, weil es mich so fickt
Und trotzdem steh' ich jeden Morgen auf und trag' mein Kreuz
An manchen Tagen mit 'nem Lachen und an manchen heul'nd
Aber das macht nix, weil der Scheiß macht unverwundbar
Ich brauch' gar nix, außer einem gottverdammten Wunder träum' von 
Goldenen Ketten und null Problem', aber leider sieht das anders aus
Ich träum' von goldenen Ketten und 'nem ruhigem Leben

Uh, ya ya, eyo Sikk sind wir am Ziel, sag du's mir
Aber auch wenn es das nicht ist, gefällt's mir gut hier
Weißt du noch, wie sie gesagt haben, wir komm' nie hoch?
Aber Gramm wurden zu Grammys und ihr macht weiter Kilos
Als wir underground war'n, hat uns keiner gepusht
Die andern Jungs aus der Hood sind ständig rein in die Clubs
Und zu viel Weißes geschnupft oder paar Teile geschluckt
Mann, die Nächte durchzuschreiben, das war Teil meiner Sucht
Und Sikk da Kid hat bis zum Morgengrauen gebounced
Und ging die Sonne auf, dann gab's freshen, neuen Sound
Geschlafen haben wir kaum, also war das auch kein Traum
Eines Morgens wacht' ich auf und war ein Clown
Eyau, ich brauch das, ich wurd für diese Scheiße gebor'n
Ich überschreite die Norm auch noch in zweitklassiger Form
Der Unterschied ist, wir sind der Inbegriff von Rap
Und euch Behinderten geht's immer um's Geschäft
Check das, ich war wie stigmatisiert, dann kam Sikk, hat's kapiert
Gab mir Kicks, gab mir Snare, gab mir Stift und Papier
Und was dann passiert, längst schon Geschichte

Uh, damals im Kreißsaal, als meine Mom mich schreien sah
Da war ihr gleich klar, das mit dem Jung' wird nicht so einfach
Ich war so verdammt cool, mein Brutkasten war ein Eisfach
Und fing sofort an zu rappen, worauf hin man mir ein Mic gab
Yeah, wir sind die Crew des Milleniums
Die Supa Dope Brothers Live, wir sind die coolsten im Ghetto
In der Villa, in der Schule, auf der Straße, aus den Boxen
In den tiefgelegten Karren, in den Klubs und in den Charts
Und ja, wir sind jetzt fast sowas wie Stars
Und nein, glaub ma', wir war'n vorher schon high
Fangfrage, was haben mein IQ und meine PIN gemeinsam?
Wie, kapierst du nicht, beide sind vierstellig
Selfmade, Baby, wir brechen den Rekord
Ruf mich vor der Arbeit an, ich battle dich in Shorts
Sikk ist mein Brother from another mother, wir holen den Highscore
Meinst du das alles ernst, nein, nicht mal ein Wort
Oder doch, das verrat' ich never, bin ich jetzt Backpack- oder Straßenrapper?
Ist auch egal, macht mal Platz für Sikk an den Turntables

Ich würd' dich gerne zudecken, doch leider geht das nicht

Du bist ihn' ein Stück näher, ich hoffe, dass sie dich wärmen
Manchmal schau' ich in den Himmel und erwisch' dich
Wie du über den Rand der weißen Wolken schielst und grinst mich
An, als wolltest du mir sagen
Hey, komm hoch und fang mich
Es tut mir so unendlich leid, aber ich kann das nicht

Ich hätt' dir sprechen beigebracht, damit du nach mir rufst
Und laufen, um mich zu finden, wenn du mal nach mir suchst
Ich wär nach dir eingeschlafen, aber vor dir erwacht
Damit ich keine Sekunde in deinem Leben verpass'
Verdrehte Welt, jeder Moment wär' ein Geschenk
Und ich wär' nicht mehr, was ich bin, ich wär' dann endlich wieder Mensch
Wenn ja, wenn, dann wär' und könnte
Aber ist nicht und so bleibt mir weiter nix, außer zu kämpfen
Dran zu denken, wie es dir da oben geht und wie du lachst
Wie du spielst, wie du fliegst und wie du über mich wachst
Dabei sollte ich der sein, der dich beschützt
Alles ist verkehrt und falsch, ich werd' verrückt
Und deshalb werd' ich zu dir kommen und dich in die Arme nehmen
Nichts wird mich je wieder quäl'n und ich schenk' dir meine Seele

Ich ging auf Verbrecherjagd, Indianer gegen Westernstar
Mit den Mädchen wollten wir nicht spielen, weil sie ätzend waren
Egal ob Regen, Hagel, Schnee, es gab kein schlechten Tag
Hat kein' Spaß gemacht, wenn wir danach nicht richtig dreckig waren
Blau gemacht, über'n Zaun ins Schwimmbad wir haben geklaut wie die Raben, früher ging das
Jeden Tag zum Bolzplatz, Könige der Straße
Autoreifen platt „Mama ich schwöre dir, ich war's nicht!“
Prügeln auf dem Schulhof, rauchen in der Pause
Keiner von uns war vor Sonnenuntergang zuhause
Wir waren die coolsten und träumten von gar nix
Dafür war keine Zeit, sowas wie Langeweile gab's nicht, yo

Lieb's oder lass es, alles dazwischendrin gibt's nicht
Als Kinder war uns scheißegal, wer broke oder rich ist
Woher du kommst und welcher Schuh war damals nicht wichtig
Und wenn du heute anders denkst, diggah, dann fick dich

Lieb's oder lass es, alles dazwischendrin gibt's nicht
Als Kinder war uns scheißegal, wer broke oder rich ist
Woher du kommst und welcher Schuh war damals nicht wichtig
Und wenn du heute anders denkst, diggah, dann fick dich

Genetikk, tikk, tikk, boom! Es war nicht immer einfach damals,
Aber witzig war's zumindest soweit's mich betraf,
Ich war nicht so brav
Denn ich wusste mich zu wehren, wenn man mich nicht mag
Und wenn die Polizei kam, hab'n wir nix gesagt
So als ich etwa 14 war entdeckte ich das Gras
Wir sind geflogen alle, immer höher Richtung Mars
Und so ging es weiter bis man über mich dann sagt
„Sein Leben war 'ne Achterbahn und dann legte er sich ins Grab.“
Wenn ein Vollspast was gewollt hat
Traf man sich kurz mal ohne Fußball auf'm Bolzplatz
Weil heut ein Vollspast was gewollt hat
Trafen wir uns kurz mal für ein Meeting auf'm Golfplatz
Doch es ist nicht wichtig, ob du irgendwann mal Gold hast
Wichtiger ist, dass du die Familie stolz machst
Mach was aus dem Leben, auch wenn's dich manchmal belastet
Entweder du liebst es oder hasst es

Lieb's oder lass es, alles dazwischendrin gibt's nicht
Als Kinder war uns scheißegal, wer broke oder rich ist
Woher du kommst und welcher Schuh war damals nicht wichtig
Und wenn du heute anders denkst, diggah, dann fick dich

Lieb's oder lass es, alles dazwischendrin gibt's nicht
Als Kinder war uns scheißegal, wer broke oder rich ist

Genetikk,"Heute Nacht ist es soweit, sie komm' mich holen
Die Sterne stehen gut in ihrer Konstellation
Ich warte auf der Lichtung, bis ich sie sichte
Halt' Ausschau nach ihnen, such' am Himmel nach Blitzen
Schließe ein' Moment die Augen und auf einmal sind sie da
Sie kommen immer näher und die Schwerkraft versagt
Alles beginnt zu schweben, sie setzen an zur Landung
Meine Strafe ist verbüst, kehrt zurück aus der Verbannung
Die Luke geht auf, ich bin geblendet vom Licht
Die Hände vor'm Gesicht mache ich den ersten Schritt
Ich weiß, ich muss gehen und doch fällt es mir schwer
Ich hab solange drauf gewartet mich von hier zu entfernen
Ich lass' alles zurück, meine Reise beginnt
Ich gehe nach Hause auch wenn ich nicht weiß, wohin
Weiter, als ich jemals war, weiter als der Mond
Vielleicht weiter als der Tod, das Universum ist groß
Für immer ist zu lang und eine Ewigkeit zu kurz
Alles fließt, alles strömt, das bestimmt mein' Kurs
Mein Platz ist da draußen, es wird langsam Zeit
Heb ab und werde Eins mit der Unendlichkeit
Die Erde wird klein, bald verschwindet sie ganz
Ein letzter Blick hinab, es war nicht alles schlecht, nein
Ich gehe in Frieden, die Waffen sind verstummt
Ihr Klang hallt nur noch dumpf durch die Erinnerung
Die letzten Worte, ein letzter Versuch
Zu gestehen mein Besuch war nicht umsonst, doch ich bin wie gelähmt, eine
Einsame Träne zum Abschied, sie fällt
So zerplatzt und verblasst das Spiegelbild meiner Welt

Und ich war' sehr gerne hier, doch meine Zeit bei euch ist beinah' vorbei
Wir haben Tränen geweint, Wege geteilt
Doch gehen muss ich leider allein
Wir werden schwerelos sein, schweben durch's All
Ziehe weiter doch ein Teil von mir bleibt
Wir hatten so schöne Zeiten, so schwere Zeiten 
Und heute sind wir endlich frei
Hinter dem Horizont
Jenseits vom Jenseits
Das bin ich der, geflogen kommt
Jenseits vom Jenseits
Jenseits vom Jenseits, oeoh
Jenseits vom Jenseits, yeah
Jenseits vom Jenseits, oeoh
Jenseits vom Jenseits
In die Ferne führt mein Weg, trotzdem werdet ihr mir fehlen
Flieg so weit, bis ich die Erde nicht mehr seh'
Sterne, die entstehen, es wird mehr als nur bequem
Jenseits vom Jenseits",Outro
Genetikk,"An alle meine Gringos, Back to the roots
Ich stolp're durch's Leben vor lauter Packets in den Boots

Zurück zum Thema, den Packs in mein' Tretern
Komm in der Pause bei und ich vercheck' dir dein' Zehner
Immer korrekt, nie gestreckt, weil das nich' klar geht

Während mein Herz im Viervierteltakt schlägt
Wiege ich das Paket, puff Haze, was geht?

Dieses Gift in den Zell'n macht Krebs
Achtzehn Jahre und du glaubst, dass du weißt, wohin der Hase läuft

Schwer ist nur, man selbst zu sein, ohne Kompromiss, yoa

Was aus einer Katze kriecht, wird immer Mäuse fressen
Bringt eure Besten, degradiere sie am Fließband
Ganz ohne Machine Gun, mach' einfach nur den Beat an

Wie lange noch, ch mach' weiter, bis die Taschen platzen
Bis die Taschen platzen, ja, bis die Taschen platzen
Ich scheiß auf jeden, ihr seid alles keine Member

Immer wenn es regnet, musst du an mich denken

Ein Feuer ohne Wärme, ein Leben ohne sie
Ein Herz im Glas, ein Gedicht ohne Strophen
Ein Donner ohne Blitz wie Regen ohne Bogen

Wie eine Hand, die keine andere zu fassen kriegt
Weil diese Welt von dem, der sie erschuf verlassen ist
Türen ohne Klinke, Küsse ohne Lippen
Nabel ohne Schnur und Logen ohne Sitze
Bühne ohne Szene, Schatten ohne Sonne
Schlüssel ohne Schloss und Trommler ohne Trommel
Züge ohne Schiene, Motten ohne Licht
Clowns ohne Schminke, ein Leben ohne dich
Adern ohne Blut, Sternschnuppen ohne Wünsche
Ihr kriegt Eden nie zu seh'n, es liegt im toten Winkel
Schreie die keiner hört, Sätze die niemand sagt
Dinge, die keiner fühlt, Schätze, die niemand jagt

Genetikk,"Weißt du was? Meine Geburt war nich' g'rade normal
Ich fiel vom Himmel meiner Mama in den Arm, schon
Meine Zeugung war ein kosmischer Plan
Das Ergebnis einer Kreuzung aus Venus und Mars, man
Schickte mich zur Erde, doch ich kam nie dort an, mein
Körper war zwar dort, aber ich war wie gefang', die
Ander'n Kids hab'm gespürt, was ich bin
Und mich verstoßen, einfach weil mit mir was nich' stimmt
Ich wuchs auf wie ihres gleichen
Lernte ihre Sprachen, die Gesten, ihre Zeichen
Doch je mehr ich sie verstand, desto mehr war'n sie mir fremd
War nie wirklich zu Haus bei der Spezies namens ""Mensch""
Ich war klein - und so sah ich in die Sterne
Und weinte so bitter, viele Trän', dass die Meere versalzten
Doch ich war zu weit weg, mich hat niemand gehört
Und so bleib ich hier, bis sie den Planeten zerstör'n

Ich gehör' hier nich' her, ich bin was and'res
Ich komme vom and'ren Ende der Galaxis
Wir teil'n rein gar nichts, außer den Planeten
Ihr und ich, ich und ihr sind nicht die selbe Spezies

Wir teil'n rein gar nichts, außer den Planeten
Ihr und ich, ich und ihr sind nicht die selbe Spezies, Spezies

Ich wurde älter, wandte mich von ihn' ab
Lasst mich allein, ich will weder eure Liebe, noch den Hass
Zog umher wie ein Streuner, verloren und einsam
Immer noch besser als verlogen gemeinsam
Doch eines Tages schickte man mir ein Signal
Eine Botschaft von Zuhause, tief aus dem All, nach
Langer Suche hätten sie mich jetzt entdeckt
Ich sei auserwählt dafür und so schenkten sie mir Raaap!
Und die Mission lautet schlicht: ""Werd' der Beste,
Dann hol'n wir dich zurück. Keine weiteren Tests mehr.
Wenn's gelingt, is' es wahr und du bist einer von uns.
Der Beweis. Wir brauchen keinen weiteren Grund""
Und jetzt verstehst du, warum ich so bin wie ich bin
Ihr wollt Fame, ihr wollt Kohle, ich will einfach nur der King sein
Es ist nich' schwer, ich kann die Zielg'rade seh'n
Ich bin auf der Überholspur - Benzin in den Ven'

Diggah, du laberst zu viel, außerdem erahn' ich dein Ziel

Nein, nich', dass ich wüsste und selbst wenn, na und? Was änderts?
Es macht uns nicht zu Freunden, dass du weißt, wer ich mit zehn war
Also quatsch mich nicht voll, Digga, was willst du von mir?
Was is' auf einma' passiert, dass ich dich jetzt interessier'?
Willst du mein Cash? Mein Fame? Alles klar, hier, kriegste gratis

Und ich schwör bei allem, so wahr Sikk mein Zeuge ist
Komme, was auch immer wolle, ich verbeug' mich nicht
Auf eurem Weg in diese Schlacht wird jeder Schritt ein kleiner Tod sein
Der Mondschein wird euch kein großer Trost sein, oh nein
Denn ihr seid sterblich und ich werd nich' eher fertig sein
Bis ihr unter Schmerzenschreien von Herzen weint, ernst gemeint
Wer will der erste sein? Freiwillige ein' Schritt nach vorn
Dich trifft der Zorn, du wirst dir gleich wünschen, du wärst nicht geboren
Und wenn einer meinem Fleisch und Blut leid antut

Ganz im Ernst ihr Hurensöhne, dann ficke ich eure drecksverdammten Mütter, 
Ihr Missgeburten! Mir ist scheiß egal, wer auf wie viele
Ich sterbe für die Familie, also haltet die Füße still! 
Ihr Primaten, ich bring euch alle um
Ihr seid dem Tod geweiht, ich stech euch ab und häng euch an die Bäume! 
Was glaubt ihr, wer ihr seid, Gangster? Unantastbar? 
Ich erbringe den Beweis des Gegenteils, quod erat demonstrandum! 
Und am ersten, der kommt, statuiere ich ein Exempel! 
Ihr kommt aus Neid und Überheblichkeit
Aber ich begegne euch mit Hass, mit purem Hass!

Dicke Titten, enge Muschi, Blaselippen, lange Beine
Bleibe auf der Straße wie'n Kick Flip
Wir sind allerhöchstens Fake übern Big Spin
Es ist Donnerstag, elf Uhr neunundfünfzig
Du weißt, wo du mich findest

Früher hab ich gedealt, heut hab ich'n Deal
Noch immer Liebe für die Street, Dago, c'est la fukkin vie
Von ihr hab' ich's gelernt, ihr gehört mein Herz
Und verdammt, ich bleib' mir treu bis zu dem Tag, an dem ich sterbe
Früher hab ich gedealt, heut hab ich'n Deal
Noch immer Liebe für die Street, Dago, alles ist supreme
Von ihr hab ich's gelernt, ihr gehört mein Herz
Und verdammt, ich bleib' ihr treu bis zu dem Tag, an dem ich sterbe

Hip-Hop ringt nach Atem wie ein Vogel unter Eis
Ich könnte ihn zwar retten, doch für sowas keine Zeit
Ich helfe stattdessen alten Frauen über die Straße
Und chill ab, Bitches blasen, wollen mit mir nackt baden
Was Battle? Kappa ist unfickbar wie ein Stein
Du rufst SOS Ich werfe einen Rettungsring aus Blei
Ich seh' kein' Grund, mit euch noch weiter zu verhandeln
Fick euch alle, komm, wir regeln das auf Straße, so wie Ampeln
Ich geh' über Leichen, du bist ein' Schritt entfernt
Rapper kriegen von mir Schläge öfter als von ihrem Herz, wir
Tun, was wir tun, und zwar aus reinster Überzeugung
Denn ich bin und bleibe fresh wie eine Python nach der Häutung 
Und der Rest ist ohne Style was dauerhaft frustriert
Ich kann Deutschen Rap nicht ficken, weil die Nutte menstruiert
Ich zerfleisch' Pseudorap wie Schwäne Brot im Teich
Ab jetzt ist jeder Mensch, der findet, dass ich scheiße Rap, mein Feind

Früher hab ich gedealt, heut hab ich'n Deal
Noch immer Liebe für die Street, Dago, c'est la fukkin vie
Von ihr hab' ich's gelernt, ihr gehört mein Herz
Und verdammt, ich bleib' mir treu bis zu dem Tag, an dem ich sterbe
Früher hab ich gedealt, heut hab ich'n Deal
Noch immer Liebe für die Street, Dago, alles ist supreme

Genetikk,"No, don't do it for the love of it
I love it when I do it for the money money

Ah, Tote Präsidenten, meine Best Friends
Ich mache mehr M's als M und M M's
Cash Man immer auf der Suche nach Investment
Doch in der Liebe gibt es leider keine Bad Bang
Manche suchen Liebe bei 'nem Lapdance
Doch lernen nur die nächste Ex kenn', sie verwechselen
Echte Liebe mit den Bitches auf ihren Tablets, Sex sells
Liebe ist ein Hashtag
Alle haben Socialmedia Jetlag
Leben vor der Webcam, Fliegen die im Netz hängen
Black, American Express, klick bang bang
Ich frag Siri wie man Crystal Meth streckt
Verfolgt von Geistern so wie Pac Man

Money Money in der Sweatpants von Palace

Sie haben vergessen wo der Unterschied ist

Der Lifestyle frei und high sein
Wieder pleite aber Baby, ich hab Money in der Pipeline
Drive-by, zwei, drei Schüsse bis dich Armors Pfeil streift
Kein Platz für Liebe in der Timeline
Lieber reich sein bevor du deinen ersten Stein schmeißt
Sag ist deine Weste rein weiß, all white
Sagst du zu den bunten Scheinen nein nein, nein
Also komm mir nicht mit dei'm Scheiß
Alles bleibt gleich, nur der Preis steigt
Sprich dein Beicht' Reim, was ich hab' ist kein Hype
Es ist meine Zeit, bin die Eins seit ich die Zeilen schreib'
Und mein Leib teil, weil mein Herz aus Eis scheint 
Keiner weint, setz mein Neid bei, weit und breit kein Weib
Lebenslang allein', schwör' kein Meineid
Keiner schmeißt Reis, Baby bye bye, ich steig' ein
Mein Vibe, vom Bordstein bis zur Skyline

If a man has money today
People wanna take it and run away
If a man has money without mates 
And a bitch call and party in spanks
You can come and move again all free
Living on top of this company
But if you want ?
Even if they're talking better than you",Cash oder Liebe
Genetikk,"Ah
Steck' seit zehntausend Jahren tief im Herzen des Berges
Sie sagen, dass ich es wert bin, für mich zu sterben
Dieser Junge gräbt mich aus, steckt mich in seinen Mund
Verschluckt mich, duckt sich
Rennt schweißgebadet, bis der Wärter den Hund schickt
Er reißt ihn nieder
Zähne tief in sei'm Fleisch
Doch nicht so tief wie das Messer, das ihn zerreißt, schneidet tief in den Bauch
Steckt seine Faust in den fiebrigen Leib
Und zieht mich raus, Blut tropft
Blut tropft auf die Lederschuhe des Warlords
Munition und Waffen für 'nen Mord ist 'n guter Deal
Dollars sind Blutverschmiert
Und ich geh durch viele Hände, Kontinente
Meer und Wüste bis zum Händler aus Europa und ich glänze, funkel, strahle
Frisch geschliffen und poliert
Ein wahrhaftiger Edelstein von makelloser Zier und Perfektion
Lupenrein, weiß mit Preisschild um den Hals
Im Schaufenster dieses Juweliers
Sie sieht mich, will mich er kauft mich, steck mich an ihren Finger
Und ich schimmer wunderschön wie immer
Sie trägt mich spazieren präsentiert mich und verliert mich
Ausgerechnet auf dem Nachttisch ihres Hotelzimmers
Wo sie ihr Versprechen brach und laut stöhnte, ihren Ehemann vergessen hat
Und das nicht zum letzten mal
So lieg' ich da als stummer Zeuge
Meine Anwesenheit ist Beweis dessen, was nicht sein sollte
Eins folgt dem andern
Und als das Zimmermädchen mich findet
Verschwinde ich in ihrer Handtasche und sie bringt mich zum Pfandleiher
Doch der droht ihr mit Anzeige
Weil er ihr ankreidet, was anscheinend offensichtlich ist
Sie ist nicht die rechtmäßige Besitzerin
Und so steckt mich der Geschäftsmann in den Safe
Und fängt schon mal an zu rechnen wie viel Geld er gemacht hat
Denn er zählt es gern achtsam, weil er schläft dann entspannter
Doch plötzlich geht die Tür auf Hände hoch, Überfall! 
Pack alles was du hast in den Rucksack all deinen scheiß Schmuck, man!
Und die Jungs springen in den Fluchtwagen
Wissen noch nicht dass sie zum Letzten mal in Freiheit Luft atmen
Weil sie die Bullen jagen und kriegen
Handschellen klicken, schnell ins Kittchen
Und weil keiner mit der Beute entwischt ist
Lieg' ich in der Asservatenkammer, ein paar Tage lang
Bis einer von der Staatsanwaltschaft mich einsteckt
Und auf Kreuzfahrt bringt
So ein teurer Ring, sie muss doch ja sagen
Denkt er sich und kniet vor ihr
Aber nein und so steht er allein, noch eine Weile am Bug
Schaut auf den Ozean und schmeißt mich rein
Sinke immer tiefer, immer kälter
Immer mehr Druck, kein Licht mehr, keine Menschen
Hier war mein Platz von Anfang an, verborgen im Dunkel
Wär' besser ihr hättet mich nie gefunden!
Hier war mein Platz von Anfang an, verborgen im Dunkel
Wär' besser ihr hättet mich nie gefunden!

Wird euch ernähren? Glaubt ihr, das euer Glück währt?

Trommeln des Krieges, ergeben uns niemals
Ihr stört unseren Frieden, wir zücken das Kriegsbeil
Reißt nur das Gold von der Wand, es gibt hier keinen Echo
Außer in den Bergen mein Kriegsschrei
Sie wollen mir sagen, der Fluss ist zu breit
Dieser Baum ist zu hoch, dieser Büffel zu stark

Le jour des rides
Le jour des larmes et des berceaux

Qu'il s'éternise ou soit trop court
Qu'il soit souhaité ou redouté

Tissée du fil de ma p’tite vie

Entre les remparts du non-dit
Bien au-delà des faux sourires
Et des destins auxquels j’aspire

C’est con comme la lune en plein jour
Mais ça change des histoires d’amour

À me dire que l’vent peut tourner 
Même si l’vieux temps s’est envolé

Et puis bientôt font leur entrée
Les méchants loups que j’ai flattés
Dans les moments de coeurs fanés
J’ai fait l’amour tou’déguisée

Quand les appels que j’ai lancés
Se sont perdus dans la routine
C’est pour te sonner les matines 
Que loin de toi j’allais danser

J’ai eu besoin pour avancer
De me punir, de tout détruire
C’est la seule façon que j’ai trouvée
Pour éviter d’avoir à fuir

Encore assise, presque couchée
À me demander à quoi penser
À me dire que l’vent peut tourner 
Même si l’vieux temps s’est envolé

Sur les chemins que j’ai tracés
D’hier vers jusqu’à maintenant
Il y a les doutes que j’ai semés
Où l’espoir pousse en attendant

Il y a la paix que j’ai cherchée
Sans vraiment vouloir la trouver
Et puis l’amour que j’ai trouvé 
Sans jamais vraiment le chercher

J’ai fait confiance à chaque instant 
En vivant toujours au printemps
Quand la neige venait à tomber
C’était ma journée de congé

J’ai mis au monde cent mille enfants
Et deux d’entre-eux sont déjà grands
Tout ça pour appeler la beauté 
Et pour ne jamais l’oublier

Encore assise, presque couchée
À me demander à quoi penser
À me dire que l’vent peut tourner 
Même si l’vieux temps s’est envolé

Encore assise, presque levée
À me demander pourquoi penser
À me dire que l’vent a tourné 
Et que l’bon temps peut arriver",Encore assise

And candle lights on little corner tables

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

The song that Crosby sings

Well sir, all I can say is

Well sir, all I can say is

Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,

That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Come to me...Taste the need. [come to me]
Painfully urging me to watch you bleed.
I put the needle in you...I like {want} you on your back.
Velvet dreams...A quick solution to set you free.
As your sex begins to drip, the scent reminds you of my grip.
Your ruptured senses will divide as I slip inside.

before i was born that's all i know  
there were two young cruel brave young men    
their king said hit the road and come back again  
they got the gig 'cause the king thought they had what it took 
and the aztecs shivered and incas shook  
they saw the white sails and muskets long  
thought these are gods/but they were wrong    
to the native people's sorrow  
here come Cortez and Pizarro  
Hernando and Francisco  
hacked their way to heaven blow by blow  
men of god in Spain they worked for someone else  
in Mexico    
they burned their ships upon the shore  
said we ain't goin' back to Spain no more  
in the smoking embers on the sand lay the future of the land    
to the native people's sorrow  
here come Cortez and Pizarro  
Hernando and Francisco  
hacked their way to heaven blow by blow  
men of god in Spain they worked for someone else 
in Mexico    
now gifts were gave/hands were shook  
but men are men/and man they took    
now the thing that brought this on for me  
was my cool earring and my new goatee  
the mirror shows a 16th century caballero  
so i thought i'd get some armor and grab my steed

A passage run, go down, descend.
And underground the air is stale
With blurring light and endless rail.
On the wheels in motion, underground.

Silent noise, relentless sound.
Through shuttered aisle, the wheels go 'round.
The day is night, yet never still,
From port to port, with miles to kill.
On wheels in motion, underground.
Just the locomotion, underground.

Windows dark, no view obscured.
With moving eyes, no sight assured.
Yet moving on, from place to place,
Through corridors, without a face.

My unworldly sins pained many lives
Yet I heard, heard with ears that wouldn't listen
And still I watched and I saw with blinkered eyes.

If you did prepare fore those rainy days
You wouldn't be sweeped away by the storm
If you would listen what the wise man say
All that you had wouldn't be gone
If you would trust into the father
And find a few minutes to pray
Now life seems so much harder
I know jah would show you the way

Rise up and your heart it must be clean
But if you mingle ina corruption jah jah nuh let you in
I trust ina the highest supreme
Jah make i a pure as a stream
Never will i trade my love for vanity
Never will i be a victim of dem insanity
All i have is love for humanity
Come help me sing da song ya if you agree with mee

Don't burn your bridges
Don't you ever turn back and close the door
Cause it just might be
That you want to use that same bridge once more

Continue do your best and life goes on and on

when even your memories are a memory
Would someone buy me another drink?
Would someone buy me another whiskey?

Everything is so fucked up
Everything is so fucked up
Everything is so fucked up
Everything is so fucked up

When someone asks “what you been doin’?”
“Nothin’” is all I can say
It's hard to do much when I'm always in pain  
And scared to wake the next day

Every song already had its turn
‘I Hate Music’ that's Paul Westerberg 
You think its fun to be thirty-one and have ambition 
but not the bullets for the gun

Everything is so fucked up
Everything is so fucked up
My fingers just ran out of luck",Everything Is So Fucked Up
Gentry Bronson,"These days I'm waking up late
I watch too much TV and drink too much coffee
I'll go for a drive to leave your ghost behind
And sing along with the stereo

Where did you go?
Did you follow the snow
in the Spring when it melts into the ground?

I watch my cat
Is that how you came back?
You sleep all day and wake just to eat

Where did you go?
Did you follow the snow
in the Spring when it melts into the ground?

And in the darkness you found
There was no way to stick around
I see you're smiling today
Your smile will never fade away

Can't wait to jump in
Can't wait to feel the water

Gentry Bronson,"Do you remember that spring of surrender
When we played Frisbee on the railroad bridge
And Pfeiffer beer tasted just like lemonade
And you looked like you'd never be tamed
 
We were all love with Susan Sache 
And she undressed you on your birthday
I lost my wallet that night in a granite quarry
Howling at the moon
 
Are you selling television satellites now Jeffrey?
Are your kids already in Junior High School?
And when you jump from Saint Benedict's church on Saturday
Do you still believe that you can fly?

Remember when Christopher sent himself away
So we drank a bottle of rum just to see him off
Followed everywhere by the sweating heat
And the stifling boots of those pigs the cops

Are you selling television satellites now Jeffrey?
Are your kids already in Junior High School?
And when you jump from Saint Benedict's church on Saturday
Do you still believe that you can fly?

And then they busted us behind the bakery
We were rooster drunk, stone cold and wired 
They kicked you so hard in the balls
And they lit my home on fire 

Do you remember that summer breeze
And the smell of girls thick on our chests
Susan Sache said I looked just like a rock star
But you said I looked more like a clown
Do you still remember the way the river ran?
It was deep and it was blessed and it was long

turn up the radio

Without stepping foot across the county line

Angry for nothing and hiding to hide
The world is too big to be trapped in your room
Open the doors and then howl at the moon

Mud will dry and flies will buzz around

I always knew you’d walk out the door

I’m just a farm boy who came out to the West
Another Midwest boy who didn’t know any better than the rest
Escaped from home

Just to run
To where the snow won’t come
Where I can have my bare feet in the sun
I want to run

I’m not sorry for who I am

I’ve been a monster, I’ve been a fool
Running ragged over you
I’ve never had much to my name
But now I will take the blame

Gentry Bronson,"You were not born broken but the damage you carried
Was like a broken doll being sold at a fireworks display 
You were my sweet poison, made me drunk with desire
While you set the walls of our little house on fire
Leaving me behind to pick up the shards 

Of your shattered glass heart
Shattered glass heart 
My hands are bleeding as I pick up the pieces
Of your shattered glass heart

I held you for years, wiped away all your tears
But when your mascara ran I knew you’d light the fuse
To blow the two of us completely apart

With your shattered glass heart
Shattered glass heart 
My hands are bleeding as I pick up the pieces
Of your shattered glass heart

Sometimes I think we could have been the best one-night stand any two people could have
Instead I wanted you to fit with me like a lost puzzle piece
Now sleepless I walk through the ashes of my memories 
Where the worst words you said were that “You’d always have a place for me”
In your shattered glass heart

When I finally said ""no"" to your anger and your pain
I walked on broken glass through the winds of your hurricane
Now I’m out here making a fresh new start

With my shattered glass heart
My shattered glass heart
My hands are bleeding as I pick up the pieces
Of your shattered glass heart
Your shattered glass heart
Shattered glass heart 
My hands are bleeding as I pick up the pieces
Of your shattered glass heart",Shattered Glass Heart
Gentry Bronson,"This shoebox is full of all my old things
Faded photographs, Christmas cards and rings
All the letters you wrote, candle wax & a silver stone
Here’s a piece of The Wall, a Polaroid of us all

Is that who we are?
Just shoeboxes full of our rise and fall
From baby shoes to funeral songs
From where lipstick stains to where ashes fall

This shoebox lid is taped and torn 
Water stained from where it is was stored
A house for ghosts, a jail for bones
A playground for stories and cemetery stones

Is that who we are?
Just shoeboxes full of our rise and fall
From baby shoes to funeral songs
From where lipstick stains to where ashes fall

Broken mirrors and tattooed tears
A lock of your hair, the chain you would wear
All I have left is a piece of your dress
However small
It’s who we are 

Just shoeboxes full of our rise and fall
From baby shoes to funeral songs
From where lipstick stains to where ashes fall
It’s who we are
Just shoeboxes full of our rise and fall",Shoeboxes
Gentry Bronson,"Monday morning, 3am
Baby’s crying in her crib
Opened a letter from the landlord that read, 
“If there’s no rent check you’ll be evicted”

The sink is dripping and the heater’s broke
TV channels are just a joke
Frost on the windows looks like prison chains
Holding you back from a change in things

Oh Mama
It’s all right
Oh Mama

Boyfriend kicked your front door in
Late at night on a drinking binge
He lost his job at the factory
And now he takes it out on you and your new baby

That’s how my love feels for you
Look into your eyes like some far off satellite
Picking up signals from no where

I’ve had enough of this disaster
I won’t wait for the earth to move 
And in the pounding of the rain

I stand up to the hurricane
I float out on a river of flame
I stand up to the hurricane

Here I am running from an avalanche
Burning a bridge with no way back
The bullet of our love is suicide
So I light myself on fire just to survive

I’ve had enough of this disaster
I won’t wait for the earth to move 
And in the pounding of the rain

I feel so clean

I’ll help you get your kids ready for school

Will you glide here with me?
Over the water, over the sea
We will find a place to breathe

With just one look I will melt
No one knows how we felt
When we first met we stopped time
You touched my skin and I couldn’t hide

Two wounded birds flying free
Will you glide here with me?
Over the water, over the sea
We will find a place to breathe

And all of our tears
Will wash away our fears
And all our of smiles
Will shine a light for us

Smell the smoke from the wood stove
Smell the sawdust and gasoline

Old work boots seen better days

Hold your head up high where you stand

Hold your head up high where you stand

Sweat it comes in the summertime
With raspberries plump along the vine
When the snow is ten feet high
Just makes it harder to get by

The unsung hero, the working man
Hold your head up high where you stand
The unsung hero, the working man
Hold your head up high where you stand
Working man

When you look in the mirror
When you get up to shave
Do you read the lines that honest work has
written on your face?

You made your life with your hands
You made your life working the land
You may not think I understand
But I believe in the working man

Geoff Berner,"How many MC's must get dissed?
Yo, motherfucker let me speak on this
I be that lyricist, pugilist, with an educated fist
Evolutionist forced to exist on a black list

Pissed and dismissed, I resist to play the backseat
No boy from backstreet, I'm intellectually elite
My mind moves faster that Michael Johnson at a track meet
Stepping over those under me like concrete

Smaller than gnomes, shatter your thoughts like Britte Bones
Crushing feeble domes like El Nino did to mobile homes
Lamp posts get ripped apart when I envade with my tirade
Like cat in the hat during the Macy's Day parade

Worthy or an accolade instead portrayed as a charade
Conveyed as an Al Jolson with a mammy serenade
Guilty of being white and out of step like minor threat
But I'm a major threat not willing to forgive and forget

Grimm, my pseudonym, I'm an MC not a singer
Put more dents in the game than the face of Wayne Hyzienga
Scarlet lettered, fettered as a wigger, just a wannabe
Beset with every epithet, can't get the best of me

People used to giggle and laugh not clear a path
I'm over coming obstacles like Jeremy McGrath
Those who used to raise an eyebrow, kowtow
Had no respect for you then, got no respect for you know

My spectacular vernacular suspends disbelief
You went from Verbose to Coatose, silent as the chief
Our time is brief, I hope no one forgets me
Goals to achieve before I leave like Gretzky

But I'll never retire until I see this thing through
To imbue my point of you, challenging you like K 2
My forte to foray with the words I say
So clear the way motherfucker 'cause I'm here to stay

I ain't knockin' the hymns, just give me a song that moves my feet

Why should the devil have all the good music? 
Jesus told the truth and Jesus showed the way
there's one more thing I'd like to say
They nailed Him to the cross, they laid Him in the ground
Should of known you can't keep Jesus Christ down
I feel good everyday, I don't want to lose it
Al I want to, I want to, one more time now

Geoff Moore,"When life's river
Becomes a trickling stream 
I've got to remember 
He will make a way to find the sea 
When the ground is dry and cracking 
From the heat of my daily routine 
That's when a slow down and listen 
And I hear my Savior whispering 

Come to me 
Come to me 
When you are weary
When you are wandering 
Come to me, come to me 
Cast your cares upon The One 
Whose yoke is easy 
And whose burden is light 

When you feel like an island in a raging storm 
No matter what your fear says 
Jesus will never leave you alone 
He sees, He hears, and He feels your pain 
He will not pass you by 
Hear him now as He calls you by name",Come to Me

Geoff Moore,"Dust devils dancin' across the Alabama hillside
That storm was brewing out on the Dixie skyline
The sky grew black as coal in the middle of the day
My great-granddaddy watched as his house was blown away

[Chorus]
Winds of change came calling
Hit them without warning
The foundation was all that remained
Everything else was carried away

I was in the Windy City, Good Friday 1982
We were sittin' pretty, cooking steaks on the barbecue
Two thousand miles of telephone wire brought word of the tragedy
My daddy's heart lay silent now
He had been taken, taken from me
He was carried away

[Chorus]

Winds of change come calling

Geoff Moore,"Everybody's thinking about self-esteem
On talk shows, Oprah knows she read it in a magazine
'Cause we don't like ourselves so much
We just need to feel the touch
Of someone who'll accept us in our need

Nothing I have said or felt or done
There's nothing that can keep me from God's love
He will take me as I am
He's got a thing for runaway lambs
And there is mercy in His blood

We've got nothing to hide, nothing to loose
Nothing to fear, and nothing to prove
He loves us just the way He made us
And no matter how high, no matter how low
No matter how far we still have to go
He loves us just the way He made us

Everybody's talking about true success
Cashing in, psychic friends, what to eat, how to dress
But I refuse to play that game
My rules have forever changed
I will live in wonder in freedom in His rest

We've got nothing to hide, nothing to loose
Nothing to fear, and nothing to prove
He loves us just the way He made us
And no matter how high, no matter how low
No matter how far we still have to go
He loves us just the way He made us

He can't love you more
He won't love you less

Nothing to hide, lose, fear, or ever prove
Nothing to hide, lose, fear, or ever prove

Nothing to hide, nothing to loose
Nothing to fear, and nothing to prove
He loves us just the way He made us
And no matter how high, no matter how low
No matter how far we still have to go
He loves us just the way He made us

Nothing to hide, nothing to loose
Nothing to fear, and nothing to prove
He loves us just the way He made us
And no matter how high, no matter how low
No matter how far we still have to go
He loves us just the way He made us

Nothing to hide, nothing to loose
He loves us just the way He made us

Geoff Moore,"Darwin first did the imminent service of arousing attention to the 
Probability of all change in organic, as well as in the inorganic world,
Being the result of law, and not of miraculous interposition
For all life is a continuum. All living things despite their awesome diversity
Are related to each other. And evolution is the term we give to that 
Process, by which the structure of plants and animals changes with the 
Passage of time thus accounting for the continuum

I was staring through the blackboard trying to keep from sleeping,
Doing my very best to hear the subject they were teaching.
When to my surprise, I couldn't my believe my ears, 
This is what you looked like back a million years
Your uncle was a monkey, he was swinging through the trees,
He lived on green bananas, and his arms swung to his knees
He spoke with such conviction, it really made me think,
Maybe my teacher, He's the missing link!
He said...

I believe in evolution,
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
It's the only possible solution,
Big Bang fiction, that we factualize

Therefore Crow Magnum Man!
It takes a lot of faith to say we're accidents of nature,
But I believe we are the work of a loving creator
Now you can wait a million years and hope that nature does it's part,
But it only takes a moment, for God to change a heart
That's why...

I believe in evolution,
Changing of the heart, renewing of the mind.
It's the only true solution,
God is always working, changing lives (changing lives),
It's evolution redefined

I used to trust in natural selection,
My survival was all I could see.
My evolving to perfection,
Started when God rescued me

I believe in evolution,
Changing of the heart, renewing of the mind.
It's the only true solution, God is always working,
Changing lives.
I believe in evolution,
Changing of the heart, renewing of the mind
It's the only true solution,
It's evolution redefined
I believe in evolution,
Changing of the heart, renewing of the mind
It's the only true solution, God is always working,
Changing lives.

He built His life on ordinary things
Worked the land as if it were His friend
His words live within me to the end

Give more than you have taken
Love most the ones forsaken

Simple heartbeat in me until I can see
A simple heart will set me free to let extraordinary things
Flow through this ordinary heart of simplicity

It was a simple thing for a boy like me
To pray a prayer and then believe
Those were simple times, how times change
Boys grow up and life complicates

I am older but am I wiser?
Has my simple heart grown colder?

Oh, simple heartbeat in me until I can see
A simple heart will set me free to let extraordinary things
Flow through this ordinary heart of simplicity

He was a simple man of simple means
The simple truth is that He was the king
He leads us down the narrow way
That is only seen with a child's faith

Simple heartbeat in me until I can see
A simple heart will set me free to let extraordinary things

Flow through this ordinary heart of simplicity

Led me to where You are

That God blessed the broken road

Geoff Moore,"My dad chased monsters from the dark
He checked underneath my bed
And he could lift me with one arm way up over top his head
He could loosen rusty bolts with a quick turn of his wrench
And he pulled splinters from his hand and never even flinched
In thirteen years I'd never seen him cry
But the day that Grandpa died I realized

Unsinkable ships sink, unbreakable walls break
Sometimes the things you think'll never happen
Happen just like that
Unbendable steel bends
If the fury of the wind is unstoppable
I've learned to never underestimate the impossible

Then there was my junior year, Billy had a brand new car
It was late, the road was wet
I guess the curve was just too sharp
I walked away without a scratch they brought the helicopter in
Billy couldn't feel his legs, they said he'd never walk again
But Billy said he would and his Mom and Daddy prayed
And the day we graduated he stood up to say

Unsinkable ships sink, unbreakable walls break
Sometimes the things you think would never happen
Happen just like that
Unbendable steel bends
If the fury of the wind is unstoppable
I've learned to never underestimate the impossible

So don't tell me that it's over, don't give up on you and me
'Cause there's no such thing as hopeless if you believe

Geoff Moore,"Morning comes too early ,
And night time falls too late.
And sometimes all I want to do is wait.
The shadow I've been hiding in 
Has fled from me today.

I know it's easier 
To walk away, 
Than look it in the eye. 
But I will raise a shelter to the sky 
And here beneath this star tonight I'll lie 
She will slowly yield the light 
As I awaken from the longest night. 

Dreams are shaking set sirens waking up tired eyes
With the light the memories all rush into his head.
By a candle stands a mirror of his heart and soul she dances 
She was dancing through the night above his bed.
And walking to the window 

He throws the shutters out against the wall 
And from an ivory tower hears her call 
""Let light surround you"" 

It's been a long, long time 
He's had a while to think it over 
In the end he only sees the change 
Light to dark 
Dark to light 
Light to dark 
Dark to light 

Heaven must be more than this 
When angels waken with a kiss 
Sacred hearts won't take the pain 
But mine will never be the same 
He stands before the window 
His shadow slowly fading from the wall 
And from an ivory tower he hears her call 
""Let the light surround you""

Once I was but I was found.
When I heard the stained glass

Her heart is like a fortress.
She clings to her silence like a lover.
She wishes you were cold and heartless
So she wouldn't...
Wouldn't have to... feel.
Oh and when she lifts her head,
And your eyes meet,
She walks to your effortless,
With suffocating grace.
And you're caught up in the moment
And someone speaks,
And whisks it all away.

But this moment never ends,
It goes on and on inside my head.
And this moment never ends.
This moment never ends.

I've loved her forever, and in my dreams,
When the evening meets morning,
We're riding bareback moonbeams.
She belongs to different spaces.
She belongs to different times.

And this moment never ends,
It goes on and on inside my head.
And this moment never ends,
This moment never ends.

At these moments it was clear,
It's taken all my life... to get here.
Se waits for me at
The door way while I draw her pictures
Of my perfect world ...

And this moment never ends
It goes on and on inside my head.

Geoffrey Downes,"I heard you on the radio
Some other time
From some forgotten studio
Way down the line
So long, so long I've waited now
To hear you again
That song, that song will still remain
It's become an old friend
And now, the tears are in my eyes
The sound you can't disguise
The truth comes back from lies
And all I want to hear

Voice of America, ooh, America
Voice of America, ooh, America

And then you came in stereo
Calling to me
And so I watch the videos
Across the T.V.
That sound, still ringing in my ears
From a decade ago
Around, around my head, the sound from my radio
I thought, that after all these years
The tears, the growing fears
That I would never hear
Never again

Geoffrey Eales,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere","Here, There and Everywhere"

Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful

Telling people what I've found

And when I told them how beautiful you are
They didn't believe me, they didn't believe me

Are in a class beyond compare
You're the loveliest girl that one could see

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,

Geoffrey Oryema,"If you were born in heaven, girl, I'd understand so well,
but ever since I met you, child, you've made my life such hell.
With ev'ry day that passes, I fall nearer to the ground.
It seems that I've been looking for something that won't be found.
 
I was only dreaming;
I was only try'n' to catch your eye.
I was only wishing you would notice me; instead you said goodbye.
 
Could this be the new answer then to all the dreams we've made?
Could there be some solution, please, to rid me of this craze?
But ev'ry single second that you hold me in your arms.
you build me up, you raise me up, you kill me with your charms.
 
I was only dreaming;
I was only try'n' to catch your eye.
I was only wishing you would notice me; instead you said goodbye.
 
(Try'n' to catch your eye.)
Won't you stay here tonight?
Won't you make these feelings last?
Can't we start this all again?
Would that be too much to ask?
 
I was only dreaming;
I was only try'n' to catch your eye.
I was only wishing you would notice me; instead you said goodbye.

I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well

I'd sacrifice anything come what might

Georg Brunis,"Carolina 
Gave me Dinah; 
I'm the proudest one 
Beneath the Dixie sun. 

News is spreadin' 
'Bout our weddin'; 
I hear church bells ringin', 
Here's the song my heart keeps singin': 

Dinah, 
Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her! 

Dinah, 
With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

What is it about you that drives me wild
What is it that gets my heart a racin'
Well I've been thinkin' about it
And I've finally put my finger on it

It's everything you do like what you do when you're with me
It's everything you say and how you say it baby
Your kiss, your touch, the way that you love
Guess what I'm tryin' to say
It's everything

What is it about you that makes me giddy
What is it about you that makes me weak
What is it that makes me feel so damn silly
Make a list, well girl I've tried it
But there ain't no way to quantify it

It's everything you do like what you do when you're with me
It's everything you say and how you say it baby

george,"It's four past the shaking hands and the house is shouting and the wide ocean's smile is two mountains away 

If the burning laughter refracts out the window and too many threads are pulled and leaves a mark on your night-faceas red as Shanghai in Autumn Moon 

If the frozen-flat birds can thaw to soar north against the wind and stare across this great wide land with faith and feather You'll know I'll be there - my love 

If I'm drowning serenelyand the browning and the tornpicture of your unshakeable smile breathes life into my eyes I'll always be seeing you - my love 

When the brush is out of paint and we stroke the gaps full of silence and restraint and the canvas starts to peel that's when, that's when, I'll take your hand",That's When You Come to Me
george,"She always said it was difficult to be jealous
Of something that wasn't really there, I thought I knew love
But I was simply trying to convince myself of it
Trying to justify and prove myself

Finding your own love of yourself
And sharing it with another love, yout truth sears through me like a giddy rush
But like a too sharp knife as well its hurting me
It's not so scary, its is liberating, it is truth

I see your truth and you see mine, we shock ourselves with the imagery
Only cause I hold up the mirror and I show you me and you show yourself

I think it's ca;;ed truth, I know that it's right
In all it's splendid beauty and vivid gain
I think it's called truth, I think its deserves
To bring beautiful glory with necessary pain

You do not make me feel complete
Just pain of another whole that halved is another wonderful self
Joined in a beautiful mystery journey
A snake finding legs and  horse learning to sit a while

Making mistakes along the way and hurting another is a par for the course
If you are following your orn, which o course you need to do
As broken winds are mended and we watch us fly

I see your truth and you see mine, we shock ourselves with the imagery 
Only cause I hold up the mirror and you show me he and I show you myself",Truth

george,"Scrounging through the shit to find a place to call home 
To settle in, set up shop, pull out your wares and play 
To sing a song to you, for you and for me 
I need to remember what I gain and why I'm here 
The sign says gents but I don't see none here 
The sign says ladies but I'm a lady feeling alone 
Everything I need to survive is feeling threatened 

I don't want you to make me jaded 
I don't want to give you the power to make me hot and cold 

I do it because I want to have my say, give it up for you 
But you chose to throw it back at my face with your distortions 
I feel sorry for you, but you feel sorry for me 
Seeing that power sometimes lies in the hands of the weakest, the lowest kind 
The power to make me scream when I only want to whisper 
The power to make me punch when I only want to caress you

I don't want you to make me jaded 
I don't want to give you the power to make me raise my voice 
I don't want you to make me jaded 
I don't want to give you the pleasure of seeing me cry 
I just want to find a beautiful face 
And remember why I am standing here 
I just want to be at that beautiful place 
And remember why we're standing here 

I speak what I feel and then it's judged by you 
But when I judge you, you get pissed off 
I'm no different to you 
I do have the time to listen, I have the time to care 
When I've had my say I'm happy to listen to yours

The bombs will run, I wish love could have its day

Has found the cure

"George ""Mojo"" Buford","It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Last night my heart was so gay
Last night I found myself dancing
In my favorite cabaret
You were completely forgotten
Just an affair of the past
Then suddenly something happened to me
And I found my heart beating, oh, so fast
 
I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart

Don't walk alone in grey and dark nights
Look to the sky and you'll be allright
There is a sun for you to shine
Lookat yourself, what do you see?
A childhood fear to be alone, maybe a heart
Without a home, but someone's waiting there for you.

Morning sky let me touch your golden sunlight
Let me dream away the dark night, let me ride
Your silver cloud, morningsky promise me you
Live tomorrow push away my pain and sorrow
In God's golden morning sky.

Be like a river wide and strong, don't be afraid
To trust a friend, so let your life be like a song
Sing with a feeling in your heart.

Morning sky let me touch golden sunlight........

And they will sing us a song

Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows

For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die

George Benson,"Honey you do me wrong but still I'm crazy about you
Stay away too long and I can't do without you

But each hurt makes my love stronger than before
I know flowers go through rain
But how can love go through pain

Ain't that peculiar

Ain't that peculiar baby
Peculiar as can be

You tell me lies that should be obvious to me
I've been so much in love with you baby til I don't want to see
That things you do and say are designed to make me blue
It's a doggone shame my love for you makes all
Your lies seem true
But if the truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger

Ain't that peculiar
Peculiar as can be
Ain't that peculiar baby

I cried so much just like a child that's lost its home
Maybe baby you think these tears I cry are tears of joy
A child can cry so much until you do everything they say
But unlike a child my tears don't help me to get my way
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there

They can't take away my dignity.

We live inside a crimson sky
We love each other in our mind
An answer is what we must find

We're just a midnight love affair
We get together and go nowhere
I'd really like to tell the world we care
But we're just another late night love affair",Midnight Love Affair
George Benson,"There I go, there I go, there I go
There I go

Pretty baby, you are the soul who snaps my control
Such a funny thing but every time you're near me
I never can behave

You give me a smile and then I'm wrapped up in your magic
There's music all around me, crazy music
Music that keeps calling me so very close to you
Turns me your slave

Come and do with me any little thing you want to
Anything baby, just let me get next to you
Am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes?
Bright as stars that shine up above you in the clear blue skies
How I worry about you

Just can't live my life without you
Baby come here, don't have no fear
Oh, is there a wonder why
I'm really feeling in the mood for love?
So tell me why stop to think
About this weather, my dear?
This little dream might fade away
There I go talking out of my head again, oh baby
Won't you come and put our two hearts together?

That would make me strong and brave
Oh when we are one, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
If there's a cloud up above us
Go on and let it rain
I'm sure our love together will endure a hurricane
Oh my baby
Won't you please let me love you
And give a relief from this awful misery?

What is all this talk about loving me, my sweet?
I am not afraid, not anymore, not like before
Can't you understand me?

Now baby, please pull yourself together, do it soon
My soul's on fire, come on and take me
I'll be what you make me, my darling, my sweet

Oh baby, you make me feel so good
Let me take you by the hand
Come let us visit out there
In that new promised land
Maybe there we can find
A good place to use a loving state of mind
I'm so tired of being without
And never knowing what love's about

And you can blow now if you want to

Come to me, let me be

Only you can make the day end right

So turn out the lamplight
Sit by my side

Just you and I

On a day when problems get me down
It's nice to think about the love we found
All I need is you and I'll get by
And though the years may make me old and grey
Darlin' you'll still take my breath away

George Benson,"I think I finally know you
I can see beyond your smile
I think that I can show you
That what we have is still worthwhile
Don't you know that love's just like the thread
That keeps unraveling but then
It ties us back together in the end
 
In your eyes, I can see my dream's reflections
In your eyes, found the answers to my questions
In your eyes, I can see the reasons why our love's alive
In your eyes, we're drifting safely back to shore
And I think I've finally learned to love you more
 
You warned me that life changes
That no one really knows
Whether time would make us strangers
Or whether time would make us grow
Even though the winds of time will change
In a world where nothing stays the same
Through it all our love will still remain

In your eyes, we're drifting safely back to shore
And I think I've finally learned to love you more",In Your Eyes

We plan for the quiet night
Whispers and lover's sighs

And when we're face to face
Let not a moment waste
I feel like it's lover's fate
Cause it's so personal

Stronger than you and me

Keeping it personal

For us to take the night
And hide from those prying eyes

Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

Once they locked me on a chain

George Benson,"To lead a better life I need my love to be here...

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesn't know he's there

I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to meet her everywhere

Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

George Benson,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
George Benson,"The song a robin sings,
Through years of endless springs,
The murmur of a brook at eventide,
That ripples by a nook where two lovers hide.

That's Stella by starlight,
And not a dream,
My heart and I agree,
She's everything on earth to me.

George Benson,"Lately, I have had the strangest feeling
With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging 'round my mind 
Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say no special place to go
But when I ask will you be coming back soon
You don't know, never know 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye 
Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart 
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping
You just say nothing's changed 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye 
Oh, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry

George Benson,"Those fingers in my hair
That sly come hither stare
That strips my conscience bare

And I've got no defense for it
The heat is too intense for it
What good would common sense for it do

'Cause it's witchcraft, wicked witchcraft
And although, I know, it's strictly taboo

When you arouse the need in me
My heart says yes indeed in me
Proceed with what you're leading me to

It's such an ancient pitch
But one I wouldn't switch
'Cause there's no nicer witch than you

'Cause it's witchcraft, that crazy witchcraft
And although, I know, it's strictly taboo

George Benson,"How could I forget what she had on
Halter top with the capri pants on
Had a smile that would stop time
And pretty feet which is a fetish of mine
Hair down to her shoulders barely
Lip gloss with no make-up surely
I wasn't gonna let her get away
Until she heard me say

Excuse me miss
What's your name
Where are you from 
And I come and possibly 
Can I take you out tonight
To a movie, to the park
I'll have you home before it's dark 
So let me know 
Can I take you out tonight

Don't care if I get rejected
At least then I won't regret it
Regret the fact I missed the chance 
For romance at least
I walk away knowing I tried my best 
And I'm going, I'm going on with my day

My nights are long and my days are cold
Cause I don't have you
How can I be so damn demanding?
I know you said that it's over now
But I can't let go

Every day I want to pick up the phone
And tell you that 
You're everything I need and more
If only I could find you

Like a cold Summer afternoon
Like the snow coming down in June
Like a wedding without a groom
I'm missing you
I'm the desert without the sand
You're the woman without a man
I'm a ring without a hand
I'm missing you

Driving 'round thought I saw you pass me
My rearview mirror's playing tricks on me
Cause you fade away
Maybe I'm just hallucinating
Cause my loneliness got the best of me
And my heart's so weak

Every day I want to pick up the phone

George Benson,"If I cried like a baby would you change your mind?
If I told you I'm crazy would you come running back to me?
The harder I try to break away, the more I get lost in yesterday
The man that you know is just a shell, living without your life is hell

I turn on the radio just to take the hurt away
Another night and I'm missing you
Girl, it's killing me, well

[Chorus]
I don't want to die tonight, but I think I might be going down
'Cause the only one I ever cared about is nowhere to be found
I don't want to close my eyes 'cause I might not see the light of day
I'm almost out of air
You're my reason for breathing
You're my reason for breathing

I don't want to go clubbing, I got no one to dance with me
I don't want to go shopping, I got no one to spend my money on
Spending my time with one glass of wine
Playing solitaire just to ease my mind

Poured one for you, but I drank that too
Anything to kill the pain of losing you

I turn on the radio just to take the hurt away
Another night and I'm missing you
Girl, it's killing me

[Chorus: x3]

So I'm reaching out on this distant line
Hoping deep inside your heart's gonna find a reason
To keep me breathing
But I'm lost in this pain and I don't have much time

I'm so tired of walking this same old line
So I'm taking my pride, gonna throw it aside
Please let me breathe girl, I'm sorry

George Benson,"I look at you and suddenly, something in your eyes I see;
Soon begins bewitching me.
It's that old devil moon that you stole from the skies.
It's that old devil moon in your eyes.

You and you glance make this romance too hot to handle.
Stars in the night, blazing their light can't hold a candle;
To your razzle-dazzle.
You've got me flyin' high and wide, on a magic carpet ride;

Full of butterflies inside.
Want to cry, want to croon, want to laugh like a loon.
It's that old devil moon in your eyes.
Just when I think, I'm free as a dove.
Old devil moon, deep in your eyes, blinds me with love.",Old Devil Mood

Risin' up angry in the sky
And there's a new voice

There are changes
Lyin' ahead in every road
And there are new thoughts
Ready and waiting to explode
When tomorrow is today
The bells may toll for some
But nothing can change the shape of things to come
The future's comin' in, now
Sweet and strong
Ain't no-one gonna hold it back for long
There are new dreams
Crowdin' out old realities
There's revolution

In the evening on a Friday night
A little light shining through the window
Let me know everything is alright, sing this song

Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Hear me sing, summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind

See the paper lying on the sidewalk
A little music from the house next door
So I walk on up to the doorstep
Through the screen and across the floor

Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Sing it, summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind, yeah

When I come home from a hard day's work
And you're waitin' there not a care in the world

See the smile a waitin' in the kitchen
Food cooking and the plates for two
Feel the arms that reach out to hold me
In the evenin' when the day is through

Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze makes me feel fine

George Benson,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

Will color all my dreams

George Beverly Shea,"O Lord my God, When I in awesome wonder,
Consider all the worlds Thy Hands have made;
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,
Thy power throughout the universe displayed.

Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!

When through the woods, and forest glades I wander,
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees.
When I look down, from lofty mountain grandeur
And see the brook, and feel the gentle breeze.

Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!

And when I think, that God, His Son not sparing;
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;
That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died to take away my sin.

Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!

When Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation,
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart.
Then I shall bow, in humble adoration,
And then proclaim: ""My God, how great Thou art!""

George Beverly Shea,"Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see

T'was grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fear relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers, toils and snares
We have already come
T'was grace that brought us safe thus far
And grace will lead us home

When we've been there ten thousand years

We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun",Amazing Grace

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

I will cling to the old rugged cross

When other helpers fail and comforts flee
Help of the helpless, oh abide with me

I need Thy presence every passing hour
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?
Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine Lord abide with me

Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies
Heaven's morning breaks and earth's vain shadows flee
In life, in death oh Lord abide with me

Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Out of town were the people I knew

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm

George Cables,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

Moved out west where I'd be found
Dreamin' well I'm dreamin'
Well I never thought my life would change
Always thought it'd be the same
But leaving I'm still believing

That childhood dream I'll have someday
Slowly starts to fade away
I'm seeing
So very close I could almost taste
Seems those years have been a waste
Decieving it's been decieving

Time has past but I still feel
The ocean breeze it seems so real
I'm hoping, just hoping
Someday soon if it all works out
Nova Scotia is where I'm bound
Believing, I'm still believing
I'll hear the waves against the shore
Seagulls cries at the fishing warf
I'm hearing
The mackerel runs and the dory boats
The simple ways I love the most
I'm dreamin' just dreamin'

I see her when I close my eyes
The Scotia land I once despised
Longing, just longing
It's been ten years or more it seems
But I've still got my memories
I'm holdin', just holding
Through the years I've wondered why
The grass seemed greener on the other side
But I'm learning
When I set my feet on that Scotia ground
Then I know I've surely found
The meaning, the meaning

Well it don't matter where I go
'Cause in my heart my Scotia home is waitin'
Just waiting
Good Lord knows I regret the day
I packed it up and moved away
But someday, maybe somday
I'm dreaming just dreaming
Believing I'm still believing

Yeah believing, I'm still believing

Hank said, ""I'd be a cowboy
Someone like John Wayne""
Johnny said, ""Hey pilgrim
Blow that cigar smoke the other way""
Said he'd make a million dollars
Pitchin' in the major leagues
Then he stared straight into
Paul's bloodshot eyes and said
""Who would you be

Would you be John Lennon
Can you imagine giving hope with just a song
Would you be the Babe, pointin' that bat
Saying, ""This one's going long""
Maybe Moses, partin' the waters
Saying, ""Children follow me""
If you could be anyone in this whole world
Tell me, who would you be""

I knew those boys would roll their eyes
When they heard what I had to say
But I shuffled the cards and said, ""Deuces wild""
And I told them anyways

I'd be a father who had all the answers
To every question my kids had
I'd learn every word on that coffee cup
That said, ""World's Greatest Dad""
Be a perfect husband to that woman

George Canyon,"She's got an eighty-three two eighty z, just twenty three
Lives on 42nd street, Paris, Tennessee
Exactly nine hundred twenty four feet from her door to mine

Seven days a week at six a.m. she gets her five miles in
All the neighborhood men pretend to get their paper
When she goes running by

She don't see it but it's obvious
To everybody else, it all adds up

One Miss America smile, two blue eyes
Three little words I'm telling her tonight
She's cooler than cool and hotter than the 4th of July

She's five foot six and she's gonna look great
I'm seven minutes early for an eight o'clock date
She's one hot number, hallelujah, amen
She's a hard nine, working on ten

She's a first round knock out, down for the count
Loud twist and shouter, a keg of gunpowder
Sparks fly around her twenty four hours a day

She's smart and funny, ooh honey smack dab on the money
Summa cum laude a smart little hottie
Who would have thought she'd ever even look my way

I'm a lucky man there ain't no doubt
It ain't that hard to figure out

George Canyon,"He left Louisiana on a greyhound bus
Kicked off in Indiana, no idea where he was
With an empty stomach full of anger and doubts
Finally stole his way to a half-way house
And there a little grey-haired woman on a life long mission 
Took him by the hand, said, ""Boy, now you listen."" 

[Chorus:]
If you've lost your way, that's o.k.
Trust in me and have some faith 
You know where one road ends, one more begins
Something brought you here today
If you're lost, you're in the right place

So, he went to diesel college on that little old lady's dime 
Leased a fillin' station across the county line 
One cold rainy night he was fixin' a flat
When Sarah rolled into his life needin' a map 
He could tell she was running
She could tell he had a good heart 
She said, ""I don't know where I'm going.""
He said, ""I've been where you are.""

[Chorus]

Well, that map that he gave her, she never opened up
Before morning came they'd both found love
And the days and the months and the years went by 
Like that gallons of gas and cars through the drive
Sarah had just left the doctor 
She could wait to share the good news
When a drunk driver stopped her out on route '62
Not knowing where to turn, he left that cemetery
Trying to out run the pain that he couldn't bury
He ran out of gas beside a little country church 
And through an open window he heard these words 

[Chorus]",You're in the Right Place
George Canyon,"See that girl over there? Everyone thinks she's hot
And after a few, your thinkin' that you've got a shot
Well maybe you do, maybe you don't
But if you strike out there, there hauss
And start telling yourself its her lose

[Chorus]
That's just drinkin' thinkin', liquor logic in a can
Your brain cells party, and your body believes your superman
That's just drinking thinkin'
And here's where the trouble starts
The more you drink, the better you think you are

From this stage, and these lights
I see this stuff every night
A guy with a tie will challenge a biker to a fight
Or the karaoke king who gets up to sing
An oldie and hears the applause
And believes he can quit his day job

[Chorus]

Your getting better all the time

That's just drinkin' thinkin', liquor logic in a can
Your brain cells party, and your body believes your superman

George Canyon,"I drive an 85 Chevrolet pick up truck,
Got dust on the dash to bring her good luck.
She never breaks down, she never gives up,
Still goin' strong.
Got a job in the city, get up before dawn,
Drive 60 miles an hour to get back home.
The girl I love and a five year old,
I got no regrets, this is as good as it gets.

I'm a happy man
I've got everything I need,
Standing right in front of me.
It's a simple plan,
But it seems to work just fine.
I count my blessings all the time
For who I am,
I'm a happy man.

There's a river that runs through my back yard.
Don't know where it ends,
Don't know where it starts.
It whispers my name, and it speaks to my heart,
Like an old friend.
there's a place down by the property line,
Two young lovers made a promise one time.
They carved their initials in the side of a tree for eternity
Well baby that's you and me.

Give me faith, give me freedom,
Friends and family
Like the little gifts from heaven
Right down here with me.

George Canyon,"When she got the news
The phone hit the floor
She fell to her knees,
And cried his name

He had just kissed her lips,
And both of the kids
Their lives will never be the same

The end of her hardest day
The only words she could say were,
I want you to live,
I want you to love,
I want to go back to the way it was,
To hear you say my name again,
I want to see you smile again
I want you to live

It takes all of her strength
To go through his things
It feels like she's holding him again
The letters he wrote, books that he'd read
And some of his shirts still had his scent
The picture in Florida
She holds to her heart and cries out loud

I want you to live,
I want you to love,
I want to go back to the way it was,
To hear you say my name again,
I want to see your smile again,

Lying awake in the middle of the night
Trying not to let the kids hear her cry
She prays for an answer, some little of sign
And closes her eyes
And swears she hears him say,

I want you to live,
I want you to love
I want you to go on and not give up
I want you to live,
I want you to try,
I want you to know that I'm alright

George Canyon,"Everybody wants to leave this town,
But don't let that one red light slow you down,
Go on and chase your crazy dreams around,
A piece of tin blew off the barn last night,

A big ""I Love You"" left by her old flame,
Man I can't look at it another day,
I've got some elbow grease and some turpentine,

Just wanna live my life,
One step at a time.
Yeah, I've got my own ladders to climb.

The day is coming when they load that train,
With all the sinners he turned into saints.
And I know right now that's something that I ain't.
And I don't want to be left behind.
So I've got my own ladders to climb.

George Canyon,"My baby girl just turned five,
Got her mama?s smarts, 
And her daddy?s eyes,
She thinks I?m 10 feet tall,
King of the world and that?s not all. 

When I?m acting like a fool,
That?s when she thinks my jokes are cool, 
When she?s riding on my back,
I?m superman and that?s a fact.

I?m just an ordinary guy,
I can?t stop bullets and I can?t fly,
But I can be the one, who dries her eyes,
And makes her smile, when she cries,
I may never be the man she thinks I am,
But I?m gonna be the best one that I can. 

She?s never seen my name in lights,
But her eyes light up when I get home at night, 
She takes her pony for a ride,
And still wants her daddy by her side.

I make her boo-boos go bye-bye,
Sing her to sleep with a lullaby,
I?m just a joyous phenomenon,
?Cause sooner or later she?s gonna catch on.

I?m just an ordinary guy,
I can?t stop bullets and I can?t fly,
But I can be the one, who dries her eyes,
And makes her smile, when she cries,
I may never be the man she thinks I am,
But I?m gonna be the best one that I can. 

Someday her heart will find another man,
Who?ll take my place,
Just the way god planned,
Then she?ll understand.

I?m just an ordinary guy,
I can?t stop bullets and I can?t fly,
For now I?ll be the one, who dries her eyes,
And makes her smile, when she cries,
I may never be the man she thinks I am,
But I?m gonna be the best dad that I can.

He might have been or how fast he could've run
They just stare as he rolls by, all they see is a helpless kid
With no chance to live a life but If they only knew

Climbing up a snow capped mountain and planting his flag
He believes one day he'll stand up and walk away from that chair
He's got faith, he's got hope and all his mamma's prayers
He's not jaded or bitter, gonna leave the giving up for the quitters

And says, 'I'm gonna prove you wrong'

And takes a long deep breath
Lifts his right foot off the mat
And with all that he has left

Going long for a touchdown with his buddies out back

On the road to no where fast

In a small cafe just outside of Paris
By a rope swing danglin' in the breeze
Carved in the bark of a dogwood tree in Kansas

Someone let it show

Somebody wrote love and the world was changed
Just a simple word but it can do so much
In a space where nothing was

Spelled out with a backwards E in first grade
On a overpass out side of town

Said,""Say a prayer for me""

If they take me back to Texas
They won't take me back alive""

At the alter of the sun

In the valley of the gun

When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne
And seven Spanish Angels
Took another angel home

She reached down and picked the gun up
That lay smokin' in his hand
She said, ""Father, please forgive me
I can't make it without my man""

And she knew the gun was empty
And she knew she couldn't win
Her final prayer was answered
When the rifles fired again

He said ""daddy, I wish I could drive that big old truck""

You can stay up as late as you want
Watch t.v all night long
Nobody tell you what to do

I know I'm everything he just can't wait to be
But if it was up to me

I'd ride my bike down the old dirt path
Hands in the air going way to fast
Make the morning last all afternoon
In a tire swing over Beaver Creek
Man that water was cold and deep
Lie on the bank and stare up into the blue
Ya son I wanna be just like you

He said ""dad when you going to take me to work?""
I said let's stay here and play tonka trucks
Trade baseball cards
He wants to travel the world like me
Ya, I'd rather stay home, climb a big ol'tree
Catch fireflies, in a mason jar

He's just a breath away from standing in my shoes
But if I could stand in his, here's what I'd do

I'd ride my bike down the old dirt path
Hands in the air going way to fast
Make the morning last all afternoon
Sit around and make up silly songs
Build sandcastles all day long
Eat candy bars and watch cartoons

Maybe it's been standin' right beside you all along

So when you find somebody (find somebody)
You can love more than you. (more than you)
You gotta hold on, (hold on) hang on, (hang on) whatever you do
And when it feels like you've got nothin'
And your world is all but stopped
You still have everything. You still have everything
When Love is all you've got",When Love Is All You've Got
George Canyon,"Wanna leave a long day behind
Wanna take the world off my mind
I wanna give love a chance
And baby slow dance

Wanna take the kids to your moms
Wanna throw some Lionel Richie on
I wanna give love a chance
And baby slow dance

Let me show you that I'm still the man I used to be
Take you in my arms
Sweep you off your feet
'Cause I can still remember what it feels like to believe
In true romance
So baby let's slow dance
Oooo

I wanna let the moment have it's way
I wanna kiss that smile back on your face
I wanna give love a chance
And baby slow dance

So let me show you that I'm still the man I used to be
Take you in my arms
Sweep you off your feet
'Cause I can still remember what it feels like to believe
In true romance
So baby let's slow dance

Yeah let me show you that I'm still the man I used to be
Take you in my arms
Sweep you off your feet
