Stanley Turrentine,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Everywhere
Everywhere
Everywhere",A Foggy Day [#][*]

Stanley Turrentine,"I'm not in love
So don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because
I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made
I'm not in love, no no, it's because..

I like to see you
But then again
That doesn't mean you mean that much to me
So if I call you
Don't make a fuss
Don't tell your friends about the two of us
I'm not in love, no no, it's because..

I keep your picture
Upon the wall
It hides a nasty stain that's lying there
So don't you ask me
To give it back
I know you know it doesn't mean that much to me
I'm not in love, no no, it's because..

Ooh you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh you'll wait a long time
Ooh you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh you'll wait a long time

I'm not in love
So don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through

Stanley Turrentine,"When I'm away from you, boy
All I seem to do is cry
And then when I see you, boy
My, how the time does fly

I don't know if you need and love me
The way I love and need you

I hope that we can be together soon
I hope that we can be together soon
I hope that we can be together soon
Real soon, can you make it real soon?

When I think about you, girl
Chills run up and down my spine
And if my wish would come true, girl
I'd be with you all the time

For the right, day and night I'm gonna miss you
All my lonely heart seems to do

I hope that we can be together soon
(Maybe tomorrow)
I hope that we can be together soon
(Maybe tomorrow)
I feel that we can be together soon
But will you make it real soon?
(I can't wait)
Can you make it real soon?
(I can't wait, I can't wait)

I hope that we can be together
I swear I can't wait any longer
Every day my love grows stronger
Ooh, baby, and I, I'd like to make it real soon

Stanley Turrentine,"Ah
If there's a cure for this
I don't want it

I'll run from it

Stanley Turrentine,"Together again
My tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights
Are now at an end

The key to my heart
You hold in your hand
And nothing else matters
We're together again

Together again
The gray skies are gone
Your back in my arms
Now where you belong

The love that I knew
Is living again
And nothing else matters
We're together again

And nothing else matters
We're together again

Stanley Turrentine,"For a while, to love was all we could do
We were young and we knew, and our eyes were alive
Deep inside we knew our love was true
For a while we paid no mind to the past
We knew love would last
Every night somethin' right 
Would invite us to begin the dance
Somethin' happened along the way
What used to be happy was sad
Somethin' happened along the way 
And yesterday was all we had

Oh, after the love has gone
How could you lead me one
And not let me stay around?
Oh, after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?
 
For a while to love each other
With all we would ever need
Love was strong for so long
Never knew that what was wrong
Baby, wasn't right
We tried to find what we had 
Til sadness was all we shared
We were scared this affair 
Would lead our love into
Somethin' happened along the way
Yesterday  was all we had
Somethin' happened along the way
What used to be happy is sad
Somethin' happened along the way
What used to be was all we had

Oh, after the love has gone
How could you lead me on
And not let me stay around?
Oh, oh, after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?

Stanley Turrentine,"I can hear you sighin'
Sayin' you'll stay beside me
Why must it be
That you always creep
Into my dreams

On the beach we're sitting
Huggin', squeezin', kissin'
Why must it be
That you always creep
Into my dreams
In my dreams

When I'm sleep at night baby
I feel those moments of ecstasy
When you sleep at night baby
I wonder do I creep into your dreams
Or could it be I sleep alone in my fantasy

Oh, love is so amazing (Oh, oh, oh, ah, ah)
Guess you will be stayin'
So let it be
That you always creep
Into my dreams

Stanley Turrentine,"Music is a world within itself 
With a language we all understand 
With an equal opportunity 
For all to sing, dance and clap their hands 
But just because a record has a groove 
Don't make it in the groove 
But you can tell right away at letter A 
When the people start to move 
They can feel it all over 
They can feel it all over people 
They can feel it all over 
They can feel it all over people 
Music knows it is and always will 
Be one of the things that life just won't quit 
But here are some of music's pioneers 
That time will not allow us to forget 
For there's Basie, Miller, Sachmo 
And the king of all Sir Duke 
And with a voice like Ella's ringing out 
There's no way the band can lose 
You can feel it all over 
You can feel it all over people

Stanley Turrentine,"Here we are on earth together
It's you and I
God has made us fall in love, it's true
I've really found someone like you 

Will it say the love you feel for me, will it say
That you will be by my side 
To see me through
Until my life is through 

Well, in my mind, we can conquer the world
In love you and I, you and I, you and I 
I am glad at least in my life I found someone 
That may not be here forever to see me through

But I found strength in you
I only pray that I have shown you a brighter day
Because that's all that I am living for, you see
Don't worry what happens to me

And never get love
You'd better let love depart
I know it's so, and yet I know
I can't get you out of my heart

You made me leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you

I guess I'll never be the same

You love me, then you snub me

Stanley Turrentine,"Little boy lost in search of little boy found
You go a wondering, wandering 
Stumbling, tumbling, round! round!
When will you find 
What's on the tip of your mind?
Why are you blind 
To all you ever were
Never were, really are, nearly are?
Little boy false in search of little boy true
Will you ever be done traveling
Always unraveling you, you?
Running away could lead you further astray
And as for fishing in streams for pieces of dreams
Those pieces will never fit 
What is the sense of it? 
Little boy blue, don't let your little sheep roam
It's time ,come blow your horn, meet the morn
Look and see, can you be far from home?

Stanley Turrentine,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need

Stanley Turrentine,"You look at me and wonder, you look at me and doubt,
Darling your eyes are asking, ""Will the flame burn out?""
Well, no one is sure of sun shine, no one is sure of dawn,
But I am sure my love will live on and  on.
I'll be tired of you  when stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming, then I'll be tired of  you.
This I know is true, when winds are tired of blowing,
When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.

Beyond the years, 
'Til day is night, 'til wrong is right,
'Til birds refuse to sing,

Will still be whispering, whispering.

That it is tired of beating, then I'll be tired of you.",Then I'll Be Tired of You

Starfield,"Worn out, wasted
Like a bird with broken wings
Sometimes grace reminds me
I don't get to be the king

But love it washes over
Love it pulls me closer
Love it changes everything

So everything is beautiful
Even when the tears are falling
I don't need a miracle to believe

Even in the crashing down
I can hear redemption calling
And everything is beautiful to me

Sweetly, You release me
From the weight of what I've done
The trigger trips the hammer
But the bullets never come

But love it washes over
Love it pulls me closer
Love it changes everything

So everything is beautiful
Even when the tears are falling
I don't need a miracle to believe

Even in the crashing down

And love like a landslide
Like the wind
Spins around me, pulls me in

Leave 'em burning and then you're gone

You're in the mood for a dance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet
Only seventeen

You can jive
Having the time of your life

Starlite Orchestra,"Can you hear the drums Fernando?
I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

(Repeat x2)
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

I feel lost, I feel sad.
With nothing but the mem'ry of yester-love
and now now it seems those yester-dreams were just a cruel 
and foolish game we used to play,
yester-me, yester-you, yester-day.

That was the first time I saw you
Never had the guts to let you know
That I was stalkin' you

And so many things I've sacrificed
For a life looking in through your window light
Every night every day I need you more
Addicted to you, it's something to live for

Don't leave me with these bad dreams
I wanna get in your jeans bad
You always were the best thing
That I never had

My head explodes into
Thousands of tiny pieces
I feel my blood flow when I watch you
It brings me to my knees

And if you ever caught me
I wouldn't mind 'cause someone needs to stop me
And my obsession is growing stronger and stronger

I'm on my knees

And I'm psychotic for you
Psychotic for you

And I went to your mom's house
She laid me down on the couch
She told me I was young and full of energy
But I know

So many things I've sacrificed
For a life looking in to your window light
Every night every day, I need you more

Statik Selektah,"Lets do this man for real

We smoke big blunts, cigars, it's us
It's obvious, kids, we regulate up shit moving through brush
The beats is grim, the ambiance plush
The speaker won't bang, the sneaker won't lust
Snitches wish dead, the eagle gon' bust
Catch you in the wrong spot, you dust
Statik ill, bring the havoc, this is magic
Fake niggas flee out, fly out the mouth, I get you gatted
Sports cars, re endorsed yards
Everybody four stars, ray like forty jewelry gaudy
Your creature game corny, I eat your dame, you hop up on me
Head off the rip, grab the whip, rest maturely
Hanging around the vets in the sweats
Since '97 we was rolex-ing the extra
Fuck around a hundred texts
Flash flex, cash, drugs, money and sex
Dumb check smashing

Watching the game from a bird's eye view
They say it's hard to keep trust so my third eye grew
Chakras open, binocular scoping, sour smoking
Hoping my best buzz ain't only in it only for the tokens
Cause they say if who you joking with, chokin' potent with
Tag team the joker chicks, the ones who do some bogus should
Act cool on the strip, but want to put two on your hip
Macking jewels in your whips, booming your hits, screwing your bitch
Froze under my toes, bitches where my penis is
Kicking it since the womb, now you see what the fetus is
And what the fetus is? Would these niggas feed us shit?
Rob a nigga for his number 2's to put my feet in, shit
Flow slippery, rise to the tippity top
I'mma make hot drops, make snakes history
Dreams of living civilly in Sicily
Laughing with a fan like

It's the elephant in the room
Created by a collision of the sun and the moon
My sonogram was an image of a gun in the womb
That was soon to be doper than heroin in a spoon
I'm astonishing, honestly my future looking promising
As my skin tone and a crystal clean onyx is
Darker thoughts let the beats break like a Amish's
I'm a stroke of genius like Mickalene Thomas is
Hip-hop and body rocking and doing it dude
I am the living definition of improving the groove
I use the same tools to shoot that Kubrick used
Take your hero to the river, give them two b-rick shoes
Who lose? If you really ain't nobody till somebody love you
I say you ain't nobody til they speaking highly of you
And what I'm sure you wouldn't want is any kind of trouble
Unless you got a crash dummy or a body double
You got a couple homies down to catch a homi- for you
Well I'mma fold niggas into origami for you
The most notorious, Poet Laureate
Whole story is glorious, stoic warriors
And I got my eyes wide open on you quasi-
Haters still smirking like the gators on an Izod
Lacoste, y'all tomato head niggas are
Imposters, long drawn out process
Triple OG's got a worn out conscience
Reminiscing to when we was all out monsters, on
Our Sierra Leone reigning tyranny
I strike fear in their hearts, rappers stear clear of me
Black Sankofa, Ayatollah, Range Rover, games over
Bill folder, give niggas that Ebola virus

If you die to shine then ice ain’t for you
If the sky fall then the sky can’t warn you
When your head crack the base don’t warn you

Always round with the gauge and they lurkin with meaners
Who will serve to get paid, committing more than misdemeanors
Once the while the shit you see my nigga do in his life
The average shit, there’s no one on here every night

Niggas was in the fam with me, only niggas that dance with me
Bitches ain’t wanna fuck, now they on and this for a chance with me
If you knew what that bass meant this is my fuckin rhapsody
Feel like I’m a rhapsody, killin it with my faculty
High up above the ground, I swear I’m defying gravity
Yea I be younger but when I grow up I’mma buy me something
I always knew I’m like the psyche bluffin
Miss clear where the hustle, watch where I could see the future
We got bigger guns than dreams, little niggas will shoot ya
For no reason other than colors, he looked up to his brother
Now we layin beside him, too many tears for a mother
Too many story of hunger but fuck ya

I’m so emotional right now, you don’t even know

Waiting where I left you
Couldn’t wait to kiss you
Smelled your scent from the door
Answer the door in a red velour
I only get head on tour
Cause they can’t have what’s yours
Shorty Greek, with an African physique
She tasted like a peach and her eyes were green
I’m headed to the beach take this ride with me
And don't babysit the weed bitch get high with me
Jagged Edge played her legs spread
She said she needed me inside of her
She held me tighter, told her, “Pass the weed
Pull your panties to your feet
Just don’t ruin my seats, you little freak""
Now it’s been years of creeping
And I’ve been thinking about forever lately
Your body feel like heaven baby
Come and save me

It’s me, it’s me baby

I don’t need nobody else you’re all I need (All I need)

Man, how you gonna leave me like that?
I was just fucking them girls, I was gon’ get right back
At least I thought so
I guess your negative energy and your insecurities
Drew me to drawing a blank
I got a new thing, and everything is straight
Wait, you wasn’t even the only one in the first place
Couldn’t even say if you knew better, you'd do better
Cause you knew better, and you still acting like a bitch
Texts all day but don’t say shit
It’s okay boo, I don’t blame you
I know that this backwards society raised you
Taught you to play on your phone and watch cable
So while I play on your mind like I’m a Jedi
I’m probably eating a ribeye, finna hop on a red eye
Rolling up the green that shit that give you them red eyes
You is a bad bitch, it’s just time to say goodbye

I don’t need nobody else you’re all I need (All I need)",All You Need
Statik Selektah,"Life is resigned
Feel that shit baby
You drive me so crazy

Sometimes I just wanna be alone
Wanna talk to myself
When I'm at home

Just had to pay like 60 stacks in taxes
All this money I make, no thanks to federal bastards
Tell me why they take a piece of my assets?
Does Bill Gates have these same fees? I need the answers
Cause I think somebody taking advantage behind the camera
Watching, hoping I end up like Hammer in the slammer
Tiny flaws in my grammar, using anything to slander me
Looking at the Canada, can't wait to put and end to me
Bury my entities, hating only wastes your energy
Fuck negativity, I got love for all my enemies
Most are mini-me's, what they mean to me, minimal
My closet like a mini-mall and I'm expecting many more
The new millenials and the Inidgo's survive
So it's about time 'fore it changes into tide
Let's put the drum aside and read between the lines
I'm in America screaming ""Who will survive""
If only you could see through my eyes and perception
What it means to have is complexion
What it means to have these connections, to the most high
How it feels to have your two brothers in the skies
Sometimes I wanna cry, sometimes I wonder why
Sometimes I question God, can you blame me?
The sun ain't been shining here lately
And I swear it ain't the same cause

Everyday I think about you
Before I got to sleep, I pray I dream about you
Everyday I think about you
Before I got to sleep, I pray I dream about you
Sometimes I just wanna be alone, be alone

My creator had a master plan
Back when I was just an average man
Life is a snowball and avalanche
I heard a inner voice say i still had a chance
So i found my self trapped in no mans land
I felt a little tight, smoked the whole damn gram
I took that to the face, now I'm on my way
So insightful, been [?] on my mind all day
Step up the plate when it's a fork in the road
Each spoonful of knowledge is a fortunate load
That's food for thought, a little salt in the cone
On the pineal, life is bitter sweet, that's so perennial
We gotta move on from the ignorance, if I'm resilient
Moving coherent, changing appearance from the villain
Penicillin whenever this pen is spilling
They can't see what's really written, but they can feel my brilliance
They don't feel me though, they don't feel me
I swear they gon' kno

Everyday I think about you
Before I got to sleep, I pray I dream about you
Everyday I think about you
Before I got to sleep, I pray I dream about you
Sometimes I just wanna be alone, wanna be alone
Wanna be alone
Sometimes I just wanna be alone, wanna be alone",Alone

Look what I did, you all looking like pupils to what I is
On a level, you mah'fuckers can't buy shit
That's respect, live wire on my Kentucky
Fuck that nigga, that's how I feel you ain't lucky nigga, real spit

Statik Selektah,"I've been down but never been out
Around the world since I been out
Now I'm about to fuck around, pull the pin out
Cause kids needs clothes on they back
And daddy need new gold spokes on the 'Lac
Ah- I still posing for flicks holding my dick head
At the table ripping bread with my day ones
Ain't shit change dawg I got the same number
Just a little bit of money and some fame, huh
The hunger stronger than ever
I can taste blood on my taste buds
Holler back at me in eight months
Glowed up like a rave in the forest
In all white eating orange
A beautiful life

It's a beautiful life

The high top Air Force One all canvas
Took those off, hit the stage wearing sandals
Four X white t-shirt, that's standard
And1 shorts, '96 on the camera
Baby got me stiffer than L.A. Looks
So I hit her with that New York dick
Number 3, John Starks on the jersey
Bitch I've been doing this for thirty
The hair on my face says I'm a dominant man with no regards
Catch ya boy on Queens Boulevard
Sunk in the seat of something classic
Sittin' on the floor like a gypsy in a basket
Damn I'm a bastard

It's a beautiful life

The lemon grass in the bally shack
Hit up Chuck, what up I'm on my Cali swag
Cadillac dreams, transactions in between
The man and his cream, every thought brought the penny back
Ballin' off that, yo thanks for the alley act
Probably paint the cut, all black like an alley cat
Middle fingers up
You fuck boys, fucked up
Ya dismissed, had one shot but time's up
Make the block boys go crazy
Take a whiff
Ain't worried about another life
We tryin' to change shift
My reality, life from my ankle ain't actually
All you perceive these eyes can deceive
Holdin' back but I'm never holdin' out
So I doubt what ya lil trap mouth chat 'bout
Know they strapped like the back of the couch
We the era, black out on any rat in the house
Smash ya spouse until the cat tap out
Asses out until she passes out
No doubt we gettin' cash now
Use to be class clown
Don't worry about beef
I'm feelin' like a cash cow

If I'm a lion I run the jungle
I'm lying I run the streets
This nine I fire wild
I never had to sneak diss
Dismember contenders with every word I speak
With any word that's wrote, the King James I preach
The insane I see, clear view my peak
Mountain top, no sweat like Keith Cool collect
You gotta prove me wrong
You can't prove these set traps
Like boobie setbacks
My uzi det dat
Loosie puff up, coughing lungs up
I'm from NY, we pop Chris like Tucker
This brick got locked up
Duct tape tucked up
This traffic fucked up
But nothing get me nervous when I'm trafficking weight, wait
The time and the place
You bring me static, your death come
I select the date
I hate the hate, I hate the love
I hate the fake
I don't need to flex like Gray, what his name?

Bodega! Bodega!

If you fucking on the plane for the first time, Fly Virgin
I put ice on the finger roll, what am I, a Spur like Gervin?
I made a living off rap, on purpose
Should I chase the money like JPMorgan?
Pay me portions, nah ah, I need that fortune
Like no sorcerer, I need sources
Check for the wire taps on cordless
Gorgeous thug, I don't need a course to put a hole in one
If they tryna cap a 10, they could hold the sun
Black boy with the golden tongue
Spit carrots, blow purp like puns
Heartburn, no tums
If you bite the hand that feed you, I'm a cut off thumbs
No lie, come try
They wanna watch but no body see me
Flowing infinity, like the memory of my nigga Stevie

Bodega! Bodega!",Bodega!
Statik Selektah,"Because she's so cold
Because she's so cold, oh
Because she's so cold
In this cold cold weather

Full length mink chinchilla collars
The game so cold cause we chasing our dollars
It's even colder, when there's diamonds on your shoulders
But Guess make is for guests, VS makers protect
All the bullshit I know I did you wrong
And I made you so cold, bitch, listen to this song
Roses used to move you, dinner use to groove you
Now you're so cold, only smile when you choose to
Ice bucket love refrigerator romance
You caught me smashing 2 hoes now I got no chance
You're so cold so frigid, answer me I'm saying you
Ain't forgiving and I'm screaming ""I'm pimpin""
Sipping hot tea, bitches thats not me
Burberry scarf tied over, the fly rover
I think I damaged her, I use to manage her
It didn't work out no it's over and my hearts colder

Cold, cold
Because she's so cold
Because she's so cold, oh
Because she's so cold

If the sun don't melt the snow
I guess you'll never know
What it takes to love
If the sun don't melt the snow
I guess you'll never know
What it takes to love, me

I'm addicted to it, shot of clear fluid
When it comes to these bitches baby I'm the truest
Get ready for it, listen to the chorus
Showing her off, her status like the average tourist
She's sophisticated tell my momma I made it
I got a bitch that's so cold when I smoke she hate it
She ain't into jewels, she into property
She's a classy bitch but ghetto when on top of me
She be wilding out, 40 ounce and hollering out
Talking in tongues told me fuck her while I load my gun
Necklace very heavy, wrist watch blue berry
Let's put our business on the table baby you scary
Nothing but square feet, mafia rules
Square niggas can't get near me without permission
Need a pass to kill a pimp and that's the code
I'm pass the blow, fast to go hard on a ho when she acting cold

Cold, cold
Because she's so cold
Because she's so cold, oh
Because she's so cold
In this cold cold weather",Cold
Statik Selektah,"Sup niggas?
Man let's fuck around a little bit
Let me get my phone, let me get my phone
See what I got over here
Do shit like this

Population where I be is zero
If there's a prison out there that can fit me
I could stay, I'd copulate with her if she a C.O
Long as she don't gossip, I get her saved by the bell
You know that sloppy face, that's a crooked occupation
I'm wearing a crooked Ferragamo belt
I'm looking for Tatyana Ali, to get my jockey straight
Man I'm glad I got sober, I was out here 'bout to marry all the bitches
Plus the doctor said, I nearly almost did it
Five-nine is underrated, that's such an understatement
Fuck, man I might as well bury all the critics
Instead of buying chains, I'd rather buy a chain of WingStops
Don't compare me to these lames, please stop
I shoot up their venue, with a metaphor about myself
The marque say the name, the name make the marque pop
Blocka-blocka player listen here, I ain't here to play no games with you
Outting your career, like a meniscus tear
I'm the same nickel, tryna change little
All I did was stop drinking, that's when I found out I was rich in spirit
I don't got too many memories of this industry, just bits and pieces
Of beef and me driving my whip impaired, like (Skurr!)
Decisions, decisions, being made by the best ever
Respect the lyrics of the BMW stretch 7, the choice is yours
We just formed a new brotherhood called the, ""Cut you off for nothing"" crew
And yes we open the road with less brethren
When Statik Selektah decided he gon' let you have it
Call me for a verse, you'll have to call to payphone the church
And when it ring, I'll probably let the reverend grab it
Like ""Aye, tell him last time, Black Thought killed me man""

Real niggas doing real shit this year
Ain't shit change but the different spaceships to steer
It ain't a real bitch alive who can resist this here
Even fakes could see this real here, crystal clear

Yeah, real niggas doing real shit this year
Pop off, it don't mean that you won the fight
It just mean that you in the fight, probably don't even wanna fight
You swinging at the fire, last nigga violating got invited to a bottle bash with us
You in the bitter denial, thinking we won't link with you
I tint the window on the Lincoln too, do the linking to all you ""link in the bio"" ass niggas
And I may even hire hitters, trade your last tweeting for your last beating
Get them bad people to smoke everything living in the name of your fire ass Twitter
The wolves got my back right, and we glad y'all shining
Let me repeat, we glad y'all shining
But this year, we got the softest group of artists in the history of Blues, R&B, Soul
For y'all to be so willing to be so blast off honest
We're Black pride, I'm astonished, I'm a full contact guy in the flag
Ball climbing, it ain't a nigga from this era as resilient as me
I made a whole career off survival for millions to see
A nigga with a bottle, some will and some brilliance
Some beats for fulfillment, some children for peace
I spent at least ten years drunk, tryna do the impossible
Which is try to walk on water and not sink
And that's when I experienced the deep, that's something that I won't forget
Now I can lead millions to see while I'm soaking wet
God made y'all in image of SpongeBob so I gotta ask y'all, did it soak in yet?
I'm the top dog and without the SZA I split up the spitters
I feel like I'm Kendrick, we need the control cause I'm heartless
My soul beside ain't all the way took over
I'm searching for artists to destroy to fill the void in my hollow trophy chest
But that's fam, not associates, I'm so focused that
Last night, swear to God I had a dream that I told Beyoncé ""no""
Yes, no BS, tryna go to war with me is like messing with the Soviets
The lesson here is loud and clear
You wrestle with the stove while the stove is lit
You'll hug your way to hell but you ain't holding shit

Ain't shit change but the different spaceships to steer
It ain't a real bitch alive who can resist this here

Head on the Autobahn
My automatic aims for head shots, devil horns
I'm like the devil's pawn
Group thinker but I'm walkin' all alone
I'm an underground king with a pocket full of stones
Out of order, breathin' underwater, the enforcer
Think inside your daughter, takin' selfies with an orca
Oral sex music, shootin' on a cruise ship
Coward niggas talkin' but y'all never do shit
Smokin' dro, rocket fuel and I blast off
I quest love cause my roots is a black thought
I talk lyrics that'll cut you 'til you're in the gutter

The best MC, Bree painted a nigga words
The A-graded great, the 8 holder
Make soldiers shit on theyself, the game over

You gon' get the party shot, get your ass mollywhopped
Somebody call the janitor, we gon' need this lobby mopped

Personify street code, get your life repo'd

Dust bunnies in the home with a stove get bus money
Chickens, they don't get nothing from me
Only donate to a foundation for cleft lips

Now it's like Nobel's, retire the mic
Shut up, I'm tired of writing
It's just like beating on desks in lunch period
Schemes, I got a myriad, the game I'm 'bout to marry it
Still witty, might have been lacking in terms of visibility

Everything was crooked then, couldn't get straight life
Rough around the edges, slicing bed with a steak knife

When he listen to my music it takes him away
My only wish is that it brings him to a better place
You see, the universe is listening every time we speak
What you seek, it seek in you, so practice what you preach
And if I got some type, a voice should be used to teach
My young world, your wildest dreams are within your reach
And I'mma tell you, just like I told me
Believe in yourself, you can do anything
No matter what they say you can't do or won't be
Don't ever listen, keep limited homies, plus limits don't know me
See, knowledge your pops and wisdom's your og

I always knew that one day I would be a star
Since I was a kid I always had this feeling in my heart
Sometimes I wonder if I'm really this special or
Is there something that you ain't been telling me lord
You see I learned something vital with my whole career
From just watching, observing things over the years
A secret that I don't think that I'm supposed to share
But I don't care cause if they kill me, I was never here
You see, the truths been hidden under your nose for a long time
The only real power is the one over your mind
So once you seek control of every little thing you do
Start to unlock the potential that's inside of you
Don't you get got or cell blocked
Thinking the world's dark and hell's hot
My only hell is being enslaved 'til I'm in the box
And to my brother's treating life like it's another bitch
I encourage you to find yourself another chick
And treat her with respect, cause the moment you neglect
Start to fade and pick away pieces of your flesh
So be smart cause it's never too late for change
Never met a man who gained without feeling despair

Oh, the poem you need to listen in
And you can find my love
Love blowing in the wind

Yo, a country boy dream can beat the odds
Watching [?] on the falling stars
I pray that you make it out of the booby traps
And feeble daps that people give you on the low
Let's face off in the grass, just be careful when it grow
It's more about the messaging, less about the flow
The sky ain't the limit, although that's what we're told amongst other things
Like you can't be successful with out a flooded, embezzled, diamond chain
Well damn, what about feeding families? giving your all to manage
Don't sacrifice your canvas to paint a picture of some bullshit
Be weary of the path that talk of private jets in the pool pit
Got to be real, through your heart, to your core
Don't give up on god, when there's so much more in store
Now I don't mean to be preaching, some might say I'm reaching
But lord knows, somebody gotta teach it
I'm hoping that you listen

Oh, the poem you need to listen in
And you can find my love
Love blowing in the wind

Crumb to a loaf, you can see we're stacking pennies, getcha
I seen thug on my plug, got the block bumping
We ain't got shit to talk about, unless you cop something
Collecting change like a meter
Bajan Derek Jeeter, dump the baggies food save it in the freezer
That Benz like a woman, that Mercedes I just need her

Better bring that money back
It's a simple fact, that the bill is scrapped
With the milli mac, hit you with a rack
It's a mummy wrap
Haters jumping out got you frozen like a snapshot
Drumroll your whole team the mascot
Pure killa, no filter hoover gang
Real niggas never speak about our murder game

Crippling bullies, black hoodies
Get fully loaded nigga, I smack pussy
Pussy pussy cat, come here pussy cat
Pull that hoodie back

This style is that really good shit
This that wish a nigga would shit
2pac and Suge shit
Got a lot of niggas mad because the money's steady coming in
When I pull my phone out them bitches put they number in
Automatic guns you can call my niggas drummer men
And when they go burrrrahh, you see a bunch of running men
If you ain't fucking with M.A aye well fuck 'em then
The mixtape is coming that's a way to bring the summer in

25 years with an L on it
Put a closed eye no scale on it
Fuck paid a quarter hope it come back
If not guns out and we come back
Still from day one all about the money
Paranoid niggas so they move funny
Taught a boy learn from the hand to hand
Death is life, you can die or you stand

I don't give a fuck, not a motherfuck
Not a single solitary fuck
Pussy cream when the pistol buck
Keep a pistol tucked
Come up missing when you mess with us
Fuck the game, bitch I run the team the commissioner
I'mma freak, I'mma vicious one
Got some bitches tougher than you niggas that will hit you up
Tell the coroner, zip you up
Pop a zip, tell a sensai roll a cinci up

Motherfuckers comeing with a shock for your body tissue
Probably miss you if you was somebody important
Irrelevant rappers getting clapped in that black coffin

Said grandma, can I get a scratch off?

It's all or nothing, quit with all the bluffing
Soon as one of my cards decline, I'm in my wallet shuffling
Not so lucky, I guess that's how it's looking
I'm a pro and not a rookie, I school you all and I play hookie
These were my times with Sookie
Tea kettle whistling if she ever left the stove on
Old age had kicked in and she sent me for a store run
Gambling is in your blood, ain't superstitious but you're definitely knocking on one
If I win we all won
Behaving, imagine the good grandson that I've been
Grandma give me the missing numbers, the cash that I need
Used to love the bodegas, now they ask for I.D
Had my own two dollars just to get some scratchers for me
Around that time things were drastic, worrying 'bout our finances
Didn't no one give them to me, I was the one who finance us
Said fuck whoever doubted, that's when I took my chances
Feel strongly about whatever I believe in cause I'm a Cancer
Ain't an auction but they gave my mans a bid
Damn the CC8 just filled another bed

Voice of the unheard, louder than the bomb
Grandma's boy couldn't be prouder of my mom
For this historical perspective, a political education
I hardly ever gamble, my risk was too calculated
Caught up in the traps, to be highly and discrete
Red dollar and rented dream and get you followed by the feds
Cause this life is like a lottery, a loser then you'll probably be
Living with the ghost, like Debbie Moore with the pottery
Testing our morality when facing our mortality
Betting on a fallacy, handing over our salaries
Natural born killer, they call us Mickey and Mallory
'Til our men become warriors and our women become Valkyries
Cussing like some sailors in the open seas
Mama got the silk for the apartment smelling like potpourri
Shopping for the groceries
Got her a pepsi cola and some coke for me
Making a quick stop out the OTB

Scratch off?

Grandma, uh, and you knew that's all we needed, that's why you plant a seed and feed it
Repeat it and treat it and we playing against the odds
If we can only defeat it
We'd see it, but we standing weeping whenever we read it
And then we feeling cheated, we deserve better
Cause she done earned cheddar and I know she took her turn
Being Tina Turner, let her be returned from her ghetto
You'd know all she want is world peace if you let her
And one day we may travel, if you bought that scratch off
Like Payola at a DJ battle
And it paid off, then we made off like Madoff
And ate off that plate, constantly concentrated like Adolf
Came all the way, four hours in your heart though
Showing up in my school, saying we hit the lotto
Popped a bottle then saw that we misread it at second glance
That's when I learned life isn't up to chance

Lighting Ls for Steve, it’s hard to tell

To warm me through the night

Yes I will, I'll be alright

Born from the trenches, hotter than these bomb shells
Coated arm, Larry Hench and Bond and with these living tissues
Not doing well, knee deep in the situation
Needed so they [?] very well
Preaching that this park side, nigga made me believe to something to eat
Peter Pan always dishing out flavors for all the streets
Always respecting the elder, but never give up the seat
And life is but a tightrope, will remain full of petite
Balancing with desferal, call that Ying Yang Twin
And get chemically imbalanced when the kid starts spitting
That's the full bitten, when the price is right, we sell a dream
We was born on the rocks star, intoxicated [?]
Off the scene, wasted all the time tryna find our life
Thought the scenes of Robin life
Tryna find drug abused knees, something to lean on
So nigga, I'm just gon' keep on
Pushing like the birth of newborns
While others miss-carry the message that a nigga grew on
Thought they woke up, nigga, false alarm, we snoozed on
The grass is greener on the other side
Lord of the Flies end of the innocence
I call smell in the air, PH proof on

This is not Hannibal Barbarus
This is destroy
Special Ed students call me D-Story
We here, hijacking this Lucky 7 album
Now we gonna play a special joint

Up in the early rise and shine off my behind
Woke up like it's breakfast tea time
Shawty made omelettes, bacon bomb shit
I was late so I raced out of her mom's crib
Omelette dripping, orange juice sipping
In school, now my stomach starts tripping
Bubbling, it was all troubling
Girl I had a croissant so now that she's coming in
Fuck, damn, but she's don't know what I'm facing
I cut school and hit the train station
Lucky that the train came
Fuck I'm trying to maintain
Sweating in my clothes
Insane in the membrane
My best shot stayed at the next stop
I could find the best spot and just drop
Drop, drop, drop it like it's hot
It's all clear so I'm finding myself a spot
Did by the garbage, pants unbuckling
Didn't realize I was going on another man
Damn, he had the right to spaz
Homeless man chased as I wiped my ass

I got to, I got to, I got to go
Hey, you just don't know man, you just don't know

Before the club we grubbed on some waffles
After the club with a car full of falafel
Out the city on the center of the bridge
I swear I felt the bricks straight pressing on my ribs
Traffic's bad, backseat dash
Dropped my pants, held on a plastic bag
My boy driving, he straight gagged and gagged
People in traffic would just pass and laugh

I had to poop in there
Smelling mad funky, I'ma do this here
He's like ""Yo, you stupid weird""
I'm tired of the bag, here's a souvenir
Yeah, I had to poop in there

Hey, you just don't know man, you just don't know

I never did it in my school cause the bathroom's busted
Walk around a fool without a toilet to be trusted
I think that girl that walked by crop dusted
See, that's some fool that I just can't fuck with
Once upon a time I hooked up on a new date
We at our crib eating chocolate souffle
Out of nowhere she argue with her roommate
She tell me to leave like it's getting to late
What? It had me all curious
I just got there, why so furious?
She said that this bastard bitch played a prank and shit
And mixed it with laxative

Blow this shit out of proportion, the race in racism
A degree for my declaration
When saying Sean P say da P with exclamation
Motherfucker

Let me tell you 'bout this story of a young'n
Raised in a ghetto that he was brung in
Round the drinkin' and druggin'
Had to box it out in backyards
So I put my Nike Airs on
And dug in the dirt and I started sluggin'
I lost some, I won some, but I fought them all
Trying not to be another name upon the wall
Lots of murals that's been painted in memory of
But I'm still here so before I'm gone gimme the love
Imma take my flowers now when I can still smell 'em
Then roll up the strongest trees and inhale em
The world is getting worse everyday I try to tell em
As long as you keep buying the lies then they gon' sell 'em
Y'all niggas is mad and they tired, ready to act out
You can't keep killing them and not expect them to black out
You locked the front doors on 'em and they take the backround
All your shit will leave your face with the shit smacked out

I’m fraying but I’m saying that I’m spraying cause I am if I have to
Salute the niggas laying on the land like a statue
If I say I’m staying where I stand I'ma vanish
If I say I'm out, I'm playing with the menace
That's like beef or vendetta
You wouldn't understand the goals without a mask on your face
Shoulda really feel somthing, when they blast in your face
If you playing in the jungle feel the wrath of those apes
But I'm positive and negative, ignorant and conscience too
Listen to the angels, but watch what the monsters do
You addicted niggas sponsor you
Tell you have another one, watch that shit conquer you
Even the wise do foolish shit
Even the cop kill a kid that go to school and shit
Believe it or not, stand still and you can move with it
Open your eyes and I ain't even got to prove this shit

Oh my god
How I humble myself
As I bow to your throne
I pray for love, peace and happiness
To be present in my home
Yes, I do

Chris Rock selfies with a top 5 arms race
Moncler skullies pulled over like cover ups
On the up and up, all the bottoms all Balmain
So even a robbery is expensive
Fly guy etiquette, my niggas get extensive
Abide by peddle, a homage from off the benches
And find mine buried in solemnly by the trenches
Bed-Stuy's version of Nas, no mirage
Freeze y'all on speed dials, the murder squads
From where the arms echo like they hear the falsetto
While I'm in here with a Mimi, forreal'll hold a rod
That's like 3 lines in one couplet
So that's 312 like I'm callin' Cabrini

But go dine up in the Ritz
Why would I hide it if I'm rich? I'ma show off
Forreal, why you think Statik signed me to the clique?
Fuck you, pay me, least I said it to 'em nicely
Hate me, I reflect 'em, sendin' miss precisely
We put them grands in Jacksons to the safe
Cause of Washingtons, we spendin' them with wifey
Remember that? Thought you seen the end of that
But we carry tradition, what would be the sense in that?
Take though from Ea$y, might as well send it back
Got goons everywhere, where you gon' spend it at?
I'm done with the scramblin', pack handlin'
Shook the Ds like big titty bitch dancin'
If I get my chance in, I'm advancin'

All these feelings of nostalgia ain't new to you, ain't it?

But watch I still kill it all through whatever arrangements
Got a shot, long range, Danny Ainge 'em
I can't blame 'em, I transport the message like Jason Statham
Sleep is minimal, perspiration, elevated
Rippin' shit easy like perforation
Soon they gon' hold for investigation
More soul than your grandma cookin'

To the point that when I came out, they thought I was someone else
Ain't planned it like that, but it helps

And penetrate beyond the endless sky

And what kind of stress it can withstand

Where, you may ask, will all this end?
Well I can't say I really comprehend.
