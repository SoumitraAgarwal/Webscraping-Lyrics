Espen Lind,"I have always been the type to think before I speak
I have always been the type to look before I leap
And like a bolt out of the blue I was struck and there was you
For a moment I believed that I could let go

You lift me up into the sky
Felt like I could fly
Never gonna die
N' I almost made it but not quite
Now you're flying out of sight
And you know I can't come with you
I'll always be scared of heights
Always be scared of heights

I didn't think I'd meet someone who'd make me change my ways
Never thought I'd find someone who'd brighten up my days
Someone who made me forget
My hands were tied
My wings were clipped
Someone who made me believe that I could let go

You lift me up into the sky
I felt like I could fly
I was never gonna die
N' I almost made it but not quite
You're flying out of sight
And you know I can't come with you
'cause I'll always be scared of heights
Scared of heights

Wish I never knew how great it feels up in the air
Wish I never got to feel the wind blow through my hair
Well, in my dreams you'll always be flying high along with me
And in my dreams I'll always feel that I can let go

You lift me up into the sky
I feel like I can fly
I'm never gonna die
N' I almost made it but not quite
Now you're flying out of sight
And now I can't come with you
'cause I'll always be scared of heights

Esperanto Rock Orchestra,"Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby, picks up the rice
In the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face 
That she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie, writing the words
Of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks
In the night when there's nobody there
What does he care

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby, died in the church
And was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie, wiping the dirt
From his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?",Eleanor Rigby

Esperanza Spalding,"People I almost gave up holding on
Watching us give into our fears
I almost believe
Almost believe
All the world is helpless sorrow
No hope for a bright tomorrow
But I'm not sure enough
To give it up, no

Now as I learn how I must work for change
I nearly cave in from the weight
I almost believe
Almost believe
All the sorrows will consume me
'til peace among men I never can see
But I'm not sure enough to give it up

I'll keep faith
Like so many souls who won't be drowned
By evil in the world
I have faith in mankind
That we can guide our choices towards a healthy world
In time to ease our bind
For only hard work through time
Can change men's minds, I know
If we make some small changes now
We'll heal ourselves, some way, some how

I don't expect to ever taste the fruit
My life devoted could bring forth
I almost believe
Well I do believe
Oh the path to peace is endless
So, choosing to close our eyes makes our faults mendless
Of this I'm sure enough

I won't give up
I'm sure enough
And I won't give up
I'm sure enough
And I won't give up",Espera
Esperanza Spalding,"Don't worry if we fall in love
We will never touch the ground
Don't worry if we fall in love
We will never touch the ground
Just fall into a dream

They say 
If you die in a dream
You die in real life
Well, I just died in your arms
Lost in your eyes
And I know 
This must be a dream
'Cause I feel 
Like I can fly to heaven

They say 
If you live in a dream
You're hopelessly lost
Well, this ain't just any old dream
For our paths have crossed
And I may be hopelessly lost
But somehow 
I've managed to find heaven

And I won't worry 
If we fall in love
We will never touch the ground
I don't worry if we fall in love
We will never touch the ground
Just fall into a dream

La, la, la, la, la, la, la 
We will never fall into the ground

Esperanza Spalding,"The way 
You look at me 
When you think 
I'm not looking
Tells me

Your heart's 
A sleeping giant 
Worn out 
By someone 
You loved before me

I see you're scared 
Unconvinced by 
What I've tried to say
That I am yours 
And that nothing 
Will take me away 

You already know, 
But I'll sing it again
I love you babe 
And nothing 
Will take me away

I know that you know,
But I'll sing it again
I love you babe 
And nothing 
Will take me away

The way 
You always call me 
With some question 
And every time 

Try to pretend 
You didn't call me 
Just 'cause 
I was on your mind

Too soon for you 
To say out loud 
But I know 
You love me 
And though 
We don't say it 
Already shows

You already know, 
But I'll sing it again
I love you babe 
And nothing 
Will take me away

I know that you know,
But I'll sing it again
I love you babe 
And nothing 
Will take me away

You already know, 
But I'll sing it again
I love you babe 
And nothing 
Will take me away

You already know, 
But I'll sing it again
I love you babe 
And nothing 
Will take me away

I'll wait for you 
To open up 
But, it's not a bore
You're just 
What I've been 
Looking for

Why do you keep 
Your head in the sand? 
Whoever 
You loved before me 
That ran
Nothing like me
Nothing like me 
Nothing like me

You already know, 
But I'll sing it again
I love you babe 
And nothing 
Will take me away

I know that you know 
But I'll sing it again
I love you babe 
And nothing 
Will take me away

You already know, 
But I'll sing it again
I love you babe 
And nothing 
Will take me away

I know that you know 
But I'll sing it again
I love you babe 
And nothing 
Will take me away

The way you look at me 
When you think 
I'm not looking.
The way you call me up 
Just to see 
What's cooking

The way you look at me 
When you think 
I'm not looking 
I look at you 
That way too 
You just don't know 
That I do

I know that you know 
You already know
I know you know and 
I know it shows that 
I know you know

And you really love me baby
I can see you love me
I love
I already know, 
But sing it again
Sing in again",I Know You Know
Esperanza Spalding,"Wait a little while
We can't rush what belongs
To the heavens above
Like the course of our love without time
We'll never see what's behind
This elusive romance
Could be two who prove love is more than
Mere chance

Let's wait a little while
And find out why we're waiting
Amidst those parading
Desire like a torch fire
Amidst those who scramble
For love all a flutter
When true love is something subtler
We'll create if we just wait

We can't rush a happy ending
That's not in our destiny's plan
Sweet this seems we can't see
The grand scheme of our lives
Which really are what we'd share
If this romance is true
So take time to live yours
I will too while we

Wait a little while and be sure
We're not fooled
By the things we've been schooled
To take as signs that love's arrived
Like charm wit and beauty
Our youth made us seek them
But in truth we don't need them
We're in love, so let's take our time

Wait a little while
And find out why we're waiting
Amidst those parading
Desire like a torch fire
Amidst those who scramble
For love all a flutter
When true love is something subtler
We'll create when we just wait

Esperanza Spalding,"Love me or leave me 
But please 
Don't deceive me
And say you 
Love me how I am
You love the way 
I fit some ideal
Not the real woman 
You've yet to understand
See love ain't all heaven 
And I am no angel
But I do the best I can

You always wanted 
Something more from my body
And said you needed 
Something more from my loving
But all you got was me 
And that's all that I can be
I'm sorry if it let you down

Now it's no nice excuse 
But all the magic was used
Up on trying to uphold
Some kind of tame 
Flattering persona
That soon enough 
Was getting real old
It takes more than pressure 
To change rock to diamond
Now all you have is sand
Slipping through your fingers

You always wanted 
Something more from my body
And said you needed 
Something more from my loving
But all you got was me 
And that's all that I can be
I'm sorry if it let you down

But I'm not gonna sit around
And waste 
My precious divine energy
Trying to explain 
And being ashamed of things 
You think are wrong with me
I'm not gonna sit around
And waste 
My precious divine energy
Trying to explain 
And being ashamed
Of what you think 
Is wrong with me

Set you up 
You say I set you up
Like I was different 
Than what I am 
Offering you now
And drug your heart around
Did you forget about
All of the love 
And the acceptance 
That you promised me too?

You always wanted 
Something more from my body
And said you needed 
Something more from my loving
But all you got was me 
And that's all that I can be
I'm sorry if it let you down
You always wanted 
Something more from my body
And said you needed 
Something more from my loving
But all you got was me 
And that's all that I can be

And waste 
My precious divine energy
Trying to explain 
And being ashamed of what  
You think is wrong with me

Trying to explain 
And being ashamed of what 
You think is wrong with me",Precious
Esperanza Spalding,"If I had a penny 
For every time I caught you
Undressing me with your eyes
I'd be a rich one and then 
I could prove all my senses 
Were real all along
You wanted me too

Though now you laugh 
And call me a fool
I know you wanted me too
Before she got to you

If I could remember 
All the things you used to say 
When we were left alone
I'd have a book of sonnets 
So inspired
All the muses would cringe 
At your denial
At how you wanted me too

Though now you laugh 
And call me a fool
I know you wanted me too
Before she got to you

Before she got to you
I would say 
That we were something special 
To behold
But now it's over, all over

before she came barging through
We were prime 
To make the kind of love
As scarce as four leaf clover

Now, I'm a bit confused
'Cause what I felt 
I thought was true
Did she barge in 
And steal your heart away?
Or did you know 
From the first day
I was just someone to play?
If so, damn that's cold

Before she got to you
I would say 
That we were something special 
To behold
But now it's over, all over

Before she came barging through
We were prime 
To make the kind of love
As scarce as four leaf clover

If I could understand 
What you have found in her
More than you 
Could have had with me
I'd finally understand a mind
As twisted as yours 
Must be for you to go
Just when you wanted me too

Though now you laugh 
And call me a fool
I know you wanted me too
What kind of spell 
Has she put on you?
I know you wanted me too
Before she got to you
Before she got to you",She Got to You
Esperanza Spalding,"Mother of the spring
Her branches cradle slipping,
Buds, yawning open,
Welcome by an aging man
He greets them fondly
With memories of when
Her bows were arms that held him as a younger man
Together, they would marvel at
The birth of spring time

Now he stands beneath the apple blossoms
Every year where they used to go walking
And he tells her about the summer and the autumn,
The winter in his heart,
And their apple blossoms
(Apple blossoms)

In summer they would dream
Of being three and smile,
Imagining how round,
As the apples on the ground
That fall, they loved and waited

But winter came too soon
Before their seed could bloom
She wilted from the chill
And all fell cold and still

Now he stands beneath the apple blossoms
Every year where they use to go walking
And he tells her about the summer and the autumn,
The winter in his heart,
And their apple blossoms

As he opened the after, as she fell 
He prayed heaven would be waiting to meet her
He kisses her cold cheek goodbye,
But he couldn't surrender the hope of staying silent
So in her fallen hands he placed a seed from their favorite tree
And he laid her to rest beneath the blanket of white
'Till they'd meet again in the spring time

Now he stands beneath the apple blossoms,
Every year where they used to go walking
Walking, hmm, mmm
Walking

And from above she's always watching
But her body lies beneath the apple blossoms
Apple blossoms
Blossom
Blossom

Mother of the spring
The sleeping bud she cradles,
Slowly, unopened
Welcome by an aging man
He greets them fondly
Fondly, beneath the apple blossoms

Esperanza Spalding,"Little fly,
Thy summer's play
My thoughtless hand
Has brushed away

Am not I
A fly like thee?
Or art not thou
A man like me?

Oh, oh, oh

For I dance
And drink, and sing,
Till some blind hand
Shall brush my wing

Love me, say you do

For we're creatures of the wind 
And wild is the wind 

Wild is the wind

You touch me 
I hear the sound of mandolins 
When you kiss me 
With your kiss my life begins 

You cling to me 
All things to me 
Don't you know your life it's so

Like a leaf clings to a tree
So my darling cling to me
Let my love flow through you

As the wind 
Wilder than the wind my love is

Esperanza Spalding,"Once autumn's glow
Has gone away
And gray cotton clouds
Blanket drowsy days
You're the winter sun
Winter sun, winter sun

Once fallen leaves
Have lost their crunch
And turn to confetti
Brown and orange
I know soon
You'll come tame the whip of the wind
And bathe the naked branches with warmth and light

When tired bones tremble
From the cold
One kiss of your warmth
Heals the soul
Shine winter sun
Make this cold heart whole

Once autumn's glow
Has gone away
And gray cotton clouds
Blanket drowsy days

Come tame the whip of the wind
And bathe my naked branches in warmth and light

So I carry a little of your auburn hue
For spice when days are dull and dreary

You share your flavor, ease my misery

With you and my cup is filled with new infusions
And like your honesty
In the midst of all the sweeten chatter
Your taste, adds a real prospective

Everyone you touch turns to gold
Many have tried

Once you, paved the road for everyone

Esperanza Spalding,"She's in danger, too
Human danger
Lone canary nesting near a runway whispers
Earthly strangers
Mighty jet planes fly you casually glancing
O'er seas and mountains
Too high to see this dying bird singing her swan song
No one hears it through the din as engines burn
Stars across the sky
Watch the caveman fly
Taking in the sights
Breathing out things die
Mother nature
Dying to reach you hasn't heard from you in
Ages since when her young children
Listened to her songs with awe and reverence
Now adolescents growing fast and eating her heart
No more thank you's no good mornings
Earthly dangers
What was once your modest home now
Swarms with cars and poison
Brown skies noise and playing with toys that kill you family
Blowing up the mountains foul oil fountains
Watch the caveman burn through the sky
The last canary screams her final song and dies while
Towards her nest crawl more sprawling towns
What burns up must come down
Human nature
Scrambling late to curb hard consequences
Young mankind so much potential
Time to heed Earth's guidance
Though our science brought us to novel heights
We must come back to mother
First she'll ground us the she'll whisper
You were my most endangered species
She's in danger, too",Endagered Species

I can hold my breath for years, I won't get blue
One sweet sigh from you
In my memories the breath of life baptizes me through
Till the air is clear enough to breathe around you
I'll keep holding on

Such a thrill when you're near
But a staggering feat
Holding still when I feel
I can hear my heartbeat, your love may never flow my way
Still I'm gonna keep holding on

Shouldn't I just let go
Since there's nothing left to do
Time just melts away and the current grows stronger
Pulling me downstream toward you
But until my love runs dry
I'm gonna keep holding on
Holding on, I can't help myself when you're near
My head goes wild and my heart beats like an eager child
I keep holding on, holding on",Hold On Me

Oh oh yeah
I can't help myself

Was looking in my mirror
Took me by surprise
I can't help but see you
Running often through my mind

Helpless as a baby
Sensual disguise
I can't help but love you
It's getting better all the time

But I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no

But I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no

Love just makes me feel so, so

Love to run my fingers
Softly while you sigh
Love came and possessed you
Bringing sparkles to your eyes

Like a trip to heaven
Heaven is the prize
And I'm so glad I found you
You're an angel in disguise

But I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, even if I could

Now is this another of her cruel jokes or
She made good those threats to finally leave you
Tears well up in your eyes but your won't let you cry, and finally

She's gone, bye, bye so long
Let her, go
She's gone, bye bye so long

Still you hear each fight and solving make up
And all those crazy ways you forgave each time she loved you
Now that you're all alone you realize she filled your life with glitter
Her kisses used to thrill, now the after taste is bitter
With the memories from the mess you've endured when now

And it's nothing but natural to wonder if you've ever loved her
I'll be sure when I see that I can make you smile like that
Smile like that

Guess it's something I can't help when I notice the way your eyes focus
On each word and gesture she does that makes you smile like that
Smile like that now, I like that
Your heart is open and you love freely and all but
Not like that, I want us to be two lovely people, not really like three

Now I like that your heart is open and you love freely and all but
Not like that, I want us to be two lovely people

Just two, just me, just you
But I don't really mind if you smile like that

If it's something you can't help, don't worry
But don't pretend you don't see and feel what's obvious to me
Oh but then you smile like that
When you smile like that
If it's something we don't have, it's natural to just leave it
At that so to let you be and maybe find
Someone that makes me smile like that
I wanna smile like that yet I
Still like that your heart is open and you love freely and all so
Stay like that, let's hope that we'll be two lovely people

It stops the world and my heart's spinning

Won't deny the times that it can't defy
When a prime old edge just calls me down to the shore, ha

It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine

Esquivel,"When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

You never knew that you could be
Enchanted by a melody
The years will never drive it out
You don't know why
It's something you can't live without
You hear it in the twilight hush
And in the morning traffic rush
A song that's always new
In your heart a part of you
Oh, shines so brightly when you hear the third man theme

When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain

Esquivel,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Natives kneel in prayer by their caravans.

There, silhouetted under and eastern star,
I see my long lost blossom of shalimar

Old temple bells are calling across the sand.

An airline ticket to romantic places

A fair ground's painted swings

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

Out of the sky, I close my eyes

Ich scheiterte am Takt, niemand glaubte es,
Doch ich war stehts der Meinung das ichs schaff'
Ich hab mir alles hier alleine beigebracht
Ganz alleine meistens schrieb' ich meine Zeilen in der Nacht
Ich saß wie besessen daheim
Und war ständig auf der Suche nach dem besseren Reim
Nächtelang am Texteschreiben, schlafen wurde Nebensache
Keine Chance, ich konnte Rap auf einmal nicht mehr gehen lassen

Und ich blick' in die Gesichter,
All' die ganzen Hater sind erstaunt,
Ich hab's durchgezogen, keiner von euch hält mich jetzt noch auf
Das geht an alle die mir immer wieder schlechtes wollten,
Weiger mich noch irgendeinem Hurensohn Respekt zu zollen.
Kein Image, kein Fake, ein echtes Statement.
Alle Zweifel sind beseitigt mit EstAtainment.
Ich bring die Wichser jetzt mit Ehrlichkeit zur Strecke.
Es zu dem tA, es spricht mein Herz wenn ich hier rappe.
Ich würde diesen Weg nie gehn' wenn er einfach wär'.
Man ich bin so stolz, dass hier ist mehr als nur mein Meisterwerk.
Ganz egal, dass ich nicht bekannter als die andren bin.
Sie solln nur wissen wo zu ich verdammtnochmal im Stande bin.
Mir ist egal, ob sie mich hassen oder lieben,
Denn ich bleib mir einfach treu, niemals lass ich mich verbiegen.
Auch wenn sich mein Schicksal irgendwann einmal zum Schlechten wendet,
Bin ich trotzdem aus der Szene einfach nichtmehr weg zu denken.

Kann schon sein, dass viele Leute mich hassen,
Doch es war nie mein Ziel mir irgendwelche Freunde zu machen.
Auch wenn so viele prophezeien, dass ich Falle,
Bleib ich steh'n  immer noch alleine gegen alle.
Ich muss hier keinem was beweisen beim Rappen,
Schreib' die Zeilen nur um einfach mal ein Zeichen zu setzen.
Auch wenn so viele prophezeien, dass ich Falle, bleib ich steh'n,
Immer noch alleine gegen alle.

Und ich frag mich ernsthaft, was ist nur passiert? Alle können mich seit Neustem leiden.
Auf einmal will jeder Pisser, mit mir befreundet sein.
Als hätt' ich mein Stolz mit Füßen getreten.
'Lass ich mit jedem Handschlag eine neue Lüge entstehn.
Das ist nun vorbei, die Zeiten haben sich geändert.
Die Gesichter sind auf einmal nur noch farblos wie Gespenster.
Auch wenn ich das VBT nun hinter mir lass',
Spühr ich im Nacken einfach immer den Hass. (Immer den Hass)

Mal im Ernst, hab' ich euch je nach eurer Meinung gefragt?

Sollte das nicht reichen drohe ich der Backspin Redaktion!

Und ist mein Album scheiße, ist das überhaupt gar nicht schlimm
Nein wichtig ist für mich, dass die Verkaufszahlen stimmen!
Denn ich brauch so ne Bling-Bling-Uhr von Glashütte
Was kann ich dafür, dass Groupies mir den Arsch küssen
Saad ist schuld mich hier ins Rampenlicht zu schicken
Zu viel Bitches, man ich kann so viele Schlampen gar nicht ficken 
Autogramme auf die Titten nur mit Permanentmarker
Sodass dein dein Freund auch weiß, dass da der EstA schon dran war!
Yeah du meinst ich hätte gar nichts vorzuweisen
Doch in einem Jahr kann ich mir sicherlich einen Porsche leisten
Wozu am Boden bleiben, fliegen ist doch geil!
Was kann ich dafür, dass ihr eure Ziele nicht erreicht?
Und für Mitleid hab ich überhaupt keine Zeit
Du willst rappen wie Gott, ja dann klau meinen Style!
Denn im Endeffekt ist mir ganz egal, was ihr macht
Ich mein wenn jeder nur an sich denkt, ist an alle gedacht 

Ich bin ein Held, man kann mich auch mit Hancock vergleichen
Wieso eiskalt, ich nutze meine Fanpost zum heizen
Ich will das Cover, bin genug Sensation
Sollte das nicht reichen drohe ich der Juice Redaktion!

Jetzt mal im Ernst, ich will nur zeigen, was ich kann
Doch echt viele Rapper macht ein bisschen Hype so arrogant
Seit wann gibt es so viele Poser wo kommen die her 
Gruß an jeden, der gedacht hat ich meine den Song hier Ernst

Esta,"Das hier ist mehr als nur ein Song, das ist ne Herzenssache
Weißt du noch wir waren beste Freunde seit der ersten Klasse
Wir teilten alles, teilen war für uns ne Ehrensache
Doch nun ist so vieles anders und das macht mir schwer zu schaffen
Ich kann mich gut erinnern wir hatten die Schule satt
In den Ferien jeden Tag ab 10 Uhr auf dem Fußballplatz
Regen oder Schnee hat uns damals nie etwas ausgemacht
Den kleinsten stets ins Tor gestellt, mann hab 'n wir so laut gelacht
Dann ging ich weg, eine Welt ist zerfallen
Doch du und meine Freunde haben hier die Stellung gehalten
Ich kam zurück, wir haben uns lange nicht gesehen
Da erfuhr ich von den Jungs du bist mit anderen unterwegs
Ich war erstmal geschockt, doch ich wusste auch das ändert sich
Denn wir waren wie Brüder und einen Bruder verlässt man nicht
Alles das hat uns zusammengschweißt, was alleine ? Tzz
Dann waren wir halt zusammen allein!

Und ich weiß du gehst
Nun deinen eigenen Weg
Es ist Zeit mir das einzugestehen
Ja ich lass dich gehen
Wir haben so viel Geiles erlebt
Diese Zeit kann uns keiner mehr nehmen

Und ich weiß du gehst
Nun deinen eigenen Weg
Es ist Zeit mir das einzugestehen
Ja ich lass dich gehen
Wir haben so viel Geiles erlebt
Diese Zeit kann uns keiner mehr nehmen

Was ich denke schreib ich heute auf Papier
Wir waren unerfahren und wollten so viel Neues ausprobieren
Doch, leider zählte zu dem Neuem auch die Drogen
Und die ganze Scheiße stellte unsere Freundschaft auf die Probe
Doch, war ich mies gelaunt, abgefuckt und stur
Hattest du stets ein freies Ohr, wie bei ner Undercutfrisur. Yeah
Weißt du noch wir waren so oft die ganze Nacht on Tour
Manchmal lösten wir Probleme nicht ,doch andere mit Bravur
Und ich weiß du hast jetzt eine Familie, die dich braucht
Aber was ist mit deinen Freunden, ey wir brauchen dich doch auch!
Man ich freu mich echt dich glücklich zu sehen
Aber Freundschaft heißt auch auf die Freunde Rücksicht zu nehmen, Diggah
Du bist doch wie ein zweiter Bruder für mich
Sagst so oft du wirst dich melden warum tust du es nicht ?
Vielleicht haben wir uns auseinander gelebt
Denn jeder geht nun seinen eigenen, einen anderen Weg

Und ich weiß du gehst
Nun deinen eigenen Weg
Es ist Zeit mir das einzugestehen
Ja ich lass dich gehen
Wir haben so viel Geiles erlebt
Diese Zeit kann uns keiner mehr nehmen

Und ich weiß du gehst
Nun deinen eigenen Weg
Es ist Zeit mir das einzugestehen
Ja ich lass dich gehen
Wir haben so viel Geiles erlebt
Diese Zeit kann uns keiner mehr nehmen

Schade, dass sich unsere Wege nur noch selten kreuzen
Früher hat mir nur die Zeit mit dir die Welt bedeutet
Jetzt ist einfach nichts mehr wie es war
Aber solltest du mich brauchen bin ich da keine Frage Mann !
Ich blick zurück mit 2 lachenden Augen
Wir sind schon 20 Jahre Freunde, man ich fasse es kaum
Und ich schätze dich sehr, du bist ein herzensguter Mensch
Doch ich schätze umso mehr, dass ich dich kenn ! Geh dein' Weg Bruder !

Und ich weiß du gehst
Nun deinen eigenen Weg
Es ist Zeit mir das einzugestehen
Ja ich lass dich gehen
Wir haben so viel Geiles erlebt
Diese Zeit kann uns keiner mehr nehmen

Und ich weiß du gehst
Nun deinen eigenen Weg
Es ist Zeit mir das einzugestehen
Ja ich lass dich gehen
Wir haben so viel Geiles erlebt
Diese Zeit kann uns keiner mehr nehmen",Lass dich gehen
Esta,"Ich seh' Neid in ihren Augen sie zerreißen sich das Maul
Lektion Eins schnell gelernt man darf keinem hier vertrauen
Ich bin's Leid warum labern alle hinter meinem Rücken
Junge du willst mir was sagen man dann triff mich in Saarbrücken
Und wenn du vor mir stehst lass ich nur noch Taten sprechen
Erster Schlag, Vorbereiten zweiter Schlag, Nase brechen
Du meinst du würdest viel besser rappen als EstA
Find ich geil sag das doch mal meinem messerstechenden Backup
Zu viele Maskenrapper machen aggressiv oder
Anders gesagt, verdammt ich hasse was du liebst
Du willst Beef huh was ich klau dir Opfer die Kette
Und wenn sie fake ist polier ich dir halt nochmal die Fresse
Ich stell jetzt die ganze Szene auf den Kopf
Leute wie wollt ihr mir schaden denn mein Lebenslauf is' top
Ich lass euch reden, ihr könnt sagen was ihr wollt
Juckt mich null denn ich habe jetzt Erfolg was habt ihr huh?

Lass sie reden, ich lass sie reden
Ich mein labern können alle doch nich' einer was bewegen

Ich hab mich damals aufgeführt wie ein Spast
Mein Lehrer meinte zu mir ich hätt' kein Gefühl für den Takt
Heute rocke ich mit Twist die größten Bühnen der Stadt
Und mein Lehrer? Who gives a fuck
Bin der immer noch mit Abstand produktivste hier von allen MCs
Das VBT beherrscht und nebenbei ein Album releaset
Doch dass du kreativ bist wie Hauptschulklassen
Ist ein Widerspruch in sich wie das Wort aufzumachen
Und bekomm' ich für 'nen Song einmal negative Presse
Hau ich dem Redakteur einfach die Zähne aus der Fresse
Das geht eins, zwei paam und die Dritten sind fällig
Ich nehm' die Leute nicht mehr ernst, denn jeder Dritte verstellt sich
Deine Featureanfrage wird gekonnt ignoriert
Du fragst dich wieso? Tja, sie kommt halt von dir
Ich lass euch reden, ihr könnt sagen was ihr wollt
Juckt mich null denn ich habe jetzt Erfolg was habt ihr huh?

Lass sie reden, ich lass sie reden

Esta,"Sie hat klasse, sie ist einfach anders als die anderen 
Lächelt mich nicht an da ich jetzt ein bisschen bekannter bin
Nein sie strahlt und haut mich mit ihren blicken um 
Betritt sie einen raum ist sie automatisch der Mittelpunkt 
All eyes on her keiner stiehlt ihr die Show 
Ja sie liebt das genau wie ich es liebe zu flowen
Klar in Sachen Styl hat sie so gut wie gewonnen 
Denn ihre Blaue Jacke passt zu ihrer Louis Vuitton
Doch sie gibt damit nicht an hat sie kein bisschen nötig 
Und brauch nicht die Bestätigung sie was das sie schön ist
Sie könnte so oft lästern aber schweigt für gewöhnlich 
Man sieht ihr gar nicht an das sie reich und verwöhnt ist
Sie ist Einzelkind doch dafür ziemlich gut erzogen 
Diszipliniert hatte immer gute noten ihr ist egal ob man sie hasst oder nicht 
Denn man sieht ihr einfach sie is 'ne klasse für sich

Eine Frau die weiß was sie will 
Ja sie fährt ihren eigenen Film
Denn sie ist perfect, little Miss Perfect

Denn sie ist perfect, little Miss Perfect

Sie hat klasse sie ist einfach anders 
Als die anderen nicht nur weil die schuhe von Manolo Planik sind
Nein ihr lächeln ist charmant sie besticht allein 
Durch ihre Eleganz wenn sie tanzt
Es ist ganz klar das die Männer alle auf ihren Hintern blicken 
Sie könnte alle mit einem blick um den Finger wickeln 
Sie genießt diese Aufmerksamkeit doch auch die Fraue
Sind am staunen denken wow dieses Kleid 
Aber nicht nur ihr Style macht sie perfekt nein 
Ach das sie alle männer abblitzen lässt dieses Mädchen verliert 
Wirklich selten an reiz mit nem' hauch von Chanel Number five 
Sie ist der star in jeder Diskothek und natürlich 
Gibt es viele die das nicht so sehen 
Doch es ist ihr egal ob mann sie hasst oder nicht 
Denn man sieht ihr einfach sie is' ne klasse für sich

Eine Frau die weiß was sie will 
Ja sie fährt ihren eigenen Film

Nur ein Blick und der DJ hat sie liebgewonn' 
Zwei Minuten später spielt er ihren Lieblingssong
Sie ist single doch hällt nicht wirklich viel davon 
Ihr freund hat sie verlassen doch sie weiß 
Dass er bald wieder kommt und natürlich 
Wird sie ihn zum täufel schicken denn 
Sie will nie wieder was von so einer Enttäuschung 
Wissen ihr ist egal ob er sie hasst 
Oder nicht denn man sieht ihr einfach 
An sie ist ne' klasse für sich

Esta,"Du bist cool
Bitte bleib wie du bist
Auch wenn du nicht immer leicht hast, ich weis wie das ist
Hör diesen Zeilen genau zu, denn ich schreib sie für dich;
Ich könnt sie irgendwann bereuen oder eigentlich nicht
Yeah
In den letzten paar Wochen wurdest du langsam zu 'nem Freund
Auf dich ist verlass, du hast mich noch nie enttäuscht
Schon komisch ich hab sogar Nachts von dir geträumt 
und obwohl wir uns nicht lange kennen hat es mich gefreut

Ich hab dir wirklich schon so viel anvertraut
du hast dabei zugehört und mich dabei angeschaut
Du weist mehr als die meisten da draußen
ja manchmal ist es gut, manchmal scheiße gelaufen
Doch ohne dich hätte ich das ganze nie geschafft
sorry das ich dich die Tage so oft angeschrien hab
Egal was ich vor hab du ziehst einfach mit

Ich weiß nicht wie du heißt obwohl man dich mit M.I.C anspricht

Doch ich wünsche mir ein wenig mehr Support
Du bewegst dich überhaupt nicht und bist stehts am selben Ort
Gibt´s beim aufnehmen Beef, hängt der Haussegen schief
Und du weist genau wie ich, keine Ausrede zieht
Du bist nicht cool nur weil du immer einen Ständer hast
Ficken kannst du trotzdem nicht, also sag was ändert das?
Ja was denkst du Spasst?
Dein Horizont beschränkt sich doch im Leben 
nur auf Dämmstoff oder nen Fensterplatz
Ich hab schon high oder besoffen auf dich eingeredet
Musstest meine Fahne riechen, konntest nicht zu Seite gehen
Du wartest stehts die ganze Nacht bis ich nach Hause komm
Bist vielleicht kein Waisenhaus doch hast schon viele aufgenommen

Am Anfang schüchtern das hätte ich jetzt nicht gedacht
doch am Ende hast du bei den Battle-Runden mitgelacht
Du weist echt alles von mir, so viel kriegt keiner mit

Ich weiß nicht wie du heißt obwohl man dich mit M.I.C anspricht

Wer hätte sowas geglaubt?
M.I.C wir sind schon so lange down

Für dich hab ich damals ein paar Scheine locker gemacht
Dafür wurden in der Battle-Zeit paar Opfer geklatscht
Und wenn du mich nervst oder kein Bock auf dich hab
wirst du einfach in den Koffer gepackt
So sieht´s aus!

I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums

Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

Esteban,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Esteban,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",Sound of Silence

So I'm in love and I keep telling this guy and it's like he thinks I'm jokin every single time I tell him it's like
""Alright, OK. I love you to yea OK"" and sometimes you know when you don't know what to do
And your heart is just exploding and you look at them and it's just like
So I sing it like:
Wake me up in the morning with a kiss and make me some breakfast
And in the evening a candlelight dinner
Or when I feel restless
Give me a soft massage and my neck starts to tingle
Even when we didn't have anything you still made me feel like your queen
Now crystal and their glass is clean
Sleeping on on the floor,
You know what I mean
And I love you because you hold me down
When the world thinks I'm brave you see my frown
I love to be loved like this and I love and I love your kiss
So thankful
Yeah this is all I was trying to say to you:

You make me fall in love again
And I am so glad you chose me yeah
You make me fall in love again
All over and over again

[Royston:]
Your like my angel
Perfect for me, that's all I ever wanted you to be
Understand when you said that you loved me
What kind of man would I be if I told you I loved you constantly
You probably wouldn't believe me because your frontin like you don't even need me
Still I just wanted to tell, wanted to tell
You are my wife, my lover, my sister, I'm your brother
I feel you
I just wanted to tell you

[Both:]
You make me fall in love again
And I am so glad you chose me yeah
You make me fall in love again
All over and over again

[Estelle:]
Lovin you is like the song that I am singing
Like the snow and the stars and the sun and the conditions
Take it lots like the northern lights
Seeing you bounce my heart like the candle lights
I feel different didn't think this was me
I'm seeing wisdom, didn't think that this could be
I wanna kiss him got me being super girly
Head swirilng all because the love ain't hurtin
Thinking he was worth it

[Both:]
You make me fall in love again
And I am so glad you chose me yeah
You make me fall in love again
All over and over again

Bounce like your feet are fitted with springs and ow
It's the start of the start of the New Year
Get out ya boots get ready to start this here
Get out the house do somethin' with yourself
Put down the weed prove somethin' to yourself
This is out to the ladies and gents tryin' to do for them self they ain't waitin' on nobody else
You could say this life is a laugh and I would say it's cool but we're here in the last half
Fix up be real to yourself would ya
Sell yourself for a ring or a belt or a ki of drugs and a nine
Start blazin' 'cause your heavy and no-one can tell you nuthin
You're an idiot, life ain't real you should go to Iraq then talk about real

'Cause we only get one life and then it's gone for good
And you're the only one who seems to be stopping you
So when you step make sure it's true 
And take your time I'm telling you
People we need to be 

Free, don't think about being less than yourself
Free, negative people never good for your health
Free, don't have to kill no-one 
Don't have to steal from no-one
Spread love

Megaman
Ain't nuthin to make a change or two
Nuthin to nuthin to break a change through with you 
I see you spittin bout a pent house view
Nothings changed your looking up from a rent house dude
Ballin something that the boys go through
Yo stelly this living is what the boyz half do

Don't think about being less than yourself

Comin' through fresh cut
Stella your free 
Your gonna throw these up
Blow seas up, thug a rude boy up
Better stay on ya grind fly til your times up
Make your mind up never gonna be left behind
Time for the course
School times up
The negative the yaa
The hand prevail
Estelle hail mega 
We do this for real

Free, don't think about being less than yourself
Free, negative people never good for your health
Free, don't have to kill no-one 
Don't have to steal from no-one
Spread love

Free, don't think about being less than yourself
Free, negative people never good for your health
Free, don't have to kill no-one 
Don't have to steal from no-one
Spread love

This is a dog eat dog world 
But it belongs to the man, 
But it's not without the love 
Of a woman's understanding 
Hurting ourselves for no reason that you have, 
Was already yours, anyway, 
If you see somebody I want you to smile instead of frown, 
Just because they look angry 
Don't mean they want to beat you down, 
And it, don't cost you nothing 
But you pay for a gun, 
To kill our sisters and sons, 
People we need to be

Free!",Free

Estelle,"Hey girl I Love you so and
It's so sad that we can't even talk no, we can't even no more
Hey Girl, I'm so sad today.
And my life just drifted away.
(Can this be real girl, can this be so
Girl have we drifted so far that we can't even talk no more)

Uh huh, listen yo
We can't talk no more blood
'Cause you never ever really understood blood.
My heart was open but you stepped right on,
You never thought that I was up for being number one, yep
How long I know you, we kept in touch through college.
Never the type to give you brain I'm giving you knowledge.
We be like old school, 
I seen you fucking with some other birds. Yep
I let you roll right through.
Gave my soul to another home dude,
But you're calling me telling me your problems
And I was going through my own kind of problems
But ? you took a piss like you were care ?
Yup I had that there.
And now you're shocked when you see me
Wishing we were cool to talk wanting you to see me 
Working out your numbers to call me, come and see
But you ain't real enough to see me, I'm making it clear babe.

Hey girl I Love you so and
It's so sad that we can't even talk no, we cant even no more
Hey Girl, I'm so sad today.
And my life just drifted away.
(Can this be real girl, Can this be so
Girl have we drifted so far that we can't even talk no more)

I always knew you were the one to play the parts then
And now I see I should have kept you at arm's length
I thought you changed from the past and then you make me waste my time.

Obviously, I got you wrong from the start 
I should have never let it get that far
I can't deal with your attitude
Erase my number from your phone, I've had it with you
And it's so classic that you want to blame the whole situation on me
Now let's see, I ain't saying I was perfect
But you played your little games
Was it worth it
And everything that I did you deserved it
And these days I hardly walk out the door 'cause you blow everything
Out of proportion 
I'm not surprised we don't talk any more 'cause you just played with my mind 
But it's all good.

Hey girl I Love you so and
I'm so sad that we can't even talk no, we can't even no more
Hey Girl, I'm so sad today.
And my life just drifted away.

I wanna hug you [x2]

Well I get these gaps in time
Where I've been spacin you on my mind

... singin me lullaby's
I like how bad it seems so wrong
To feel this weighing it feels so strong
You better sing me a lullaby
So baby come on come one

[Chorus X2]

You come over and you kiss my face (you kiss my face)
Felt like I want you more without saying a thing ??
Memorizing this moment believe I la la la la la
You took my hands you kiss my lips

We don't need to be, just a memory

(If you wanna flow I'll walk away)

It was last love, not the first time
For you to notice me
'Cause you had yours and I had mine
It still wouldn't find to see
If it makes sense, I would make sense
When you put your lips on me
And the feeling, get to feel this
Like this was meant to be

Nah I, but apparently you only get one chance
And I, this is something I may want to last
But we both got other things we got to do
And then, that don't stop this girl from feeling you

Loving in the rain 'till the sun comes out, all night long
Loving in the rain 'till the sun comes out, all night long

If you wanna flow I'll walk away

But this is nothing but the real that I speak to you
Feel how I feel for you, nothing's quite real but you
I'm changing up my expectations
This ain't changing my person oh it's just relations
And uh, I tried to tell me that a couple times
But you seemed to get into my heart and write a rhyme
And you, a future with a capital F
And I wonder how I got into this beautiful mess
Now I, now this is something I would never do
But you, colour my heart in different shades of you
I guess we, we just gotta see where this will go
I know, if you're willing I'm gonna wait for you
To go with me
For to you to go with me

Estelle,"Don't tell me you love me if it ain't really true,
Don't tell me you love me just cause you in the mood,
This thing I had for you,
It's only for you my baby,

I'll give it so swiftly if you start to act a fool.
So when you say that you love me do you really understand?
Cause lovin' ain't just about touchin' and holding hands.

It's a spiritual thing that,
Really really hard so baby,
So don't gimme no lies if you really wanna be my man.

My love is so magnificent baby,
If you really real come take it.
My love is so magnificent baby,
If you really, if you really

You ain't gonna be the one to tell me how much I'm worth,
Cause I pulled myself out up from under the dirt,

You have got to believe me,
What I have don't come easy,
And if your ready like I'm ready then you gotta put in the work.
Now you know I'm the realist chick you've been waiting a while,
And I ain't dealin' with no Harvard boy cause he makes me smile,

Cause you gotta step your game up,
This is what I call a wake cause,
You can take it to the left because I'll always be the style,

What are you afraid of?
We've been playing games love
Together we crazy, good I mean baby, so why you gotta change up?
Baby when we make love, in ways I never made love
Feels so real, but something still is missing from the picture
Everywhere I go, people wanna know. wonder where I been, what's the deal with him
Is y'all really cool, is he just a friend
Now I'm asking you, tell me what it is
Look me in my eye, you don't have to lie
Must think I'm a fool, f**king round with you
Need to give me proof I need to hear the truth
I just got one question for you

Acting different when your friends around
See nah, when we together we fire and no I never tell my friends your a friend
You're my guy we're together uh huh
Calling my phone about we needed a break
How we gonna break up when we ain't willing to date?
You say you want that real woman, when you get her you run
How come I never met the family like your dad and your mum?
And I don't wanna hear it, stop being a bitch
You making me respect you less, I'm really starting to switch
You're saying that and this and your heart broken
Yeah, you sound like shit like you're taking a piss
Somebody wanna see ya chick, ya see the problem with dis is
I'm waiting in vain, I'm waiting for you to change
We ain't kicking it No, we ain't chilling NO, we ain't doing a ting blood
I'm more like a full time thing
See fam' you got your own sock drawer, you can call me much more
More then just your friend much, more than before
Don't play me like an extra, I got speaking roles
I am NOT that ho, I am so much more

Your heart was always for me but as we grow
Something changed down the road
Ain't nothing I could say that could bring us back
To the same as before
Your head is over there you don't feel the same
You don't want me no more
We got to play the game I ain't keepin' scores cause

I'm much clearer now than I've ever been
Aha, thought I'll be with you till the very end
Oh the road got long and things have changed
And you moved on and that's okay because
I finally found my way back to love again

Yeah we changed and we grow
Some things will stay the same as the others pass
Takes a while, a while on the road
And so begins the ad as we reap and sow
Then the hurt, when you're hurt
Stays pressin' on your heart, stings and lets you know
That I feel how I feel
Cuts deeper than a wound I refuse to heal but

I'm much clearer now than I've ever been
Aha, thought I'll be with you till the very end
Oh the road got long and things have changed
And you moved on and that's okay because
I finally found my way back to love again
I finally found my way back to love again

It's time to move on
Time to let go
This is nothing like we dreamed
We will end up
If I love you, I should let you go and change you
'Cause I

I'm much clearer now than I've ever been
Thought that I, thought I'll be with you till the very end

You are my soul

So far apart, I just don't know
What drove us apart in the first place now I know baby, why

These tears I cry sure won't be the last
They will not be the last, no
'Cause this pain inside never seems to pass
It never seems to pass me by

So I thank you

More of a woman to you than you are a man to me
Listen, sometimes I wonder, why me
I'm here miserable while you're out living your fantasies and didn't care

'Cause you're my heart
You are my soul
You're my other half without you I cannot be whole baby
So far apart
I just don't know

We all gotta be ready to sacrifice to survive
I hope she's happy

Went from hopin' to floatin', levitatin' on the top floor

I would beat around the bush but you're a neat freak
Got me speakin' in tongues, let me try and speak your body language
When I speak, you lunge
Oh you gon' get it when I hit it
I got a feelin' we gon' be doin' it on the ceilin', I love how you get it
You get me, I understand you
You look me in the eyes so I know that you're with me, baby, I'm with you
Damn that ocean, you're the best view
They gon' need a whole crew to clean up what we do
We knew that this one moment would feel like a lifetime
I feel so alive, you must be a lifeline
A special part of my timeline
Time ain't fair, yeah, time flies
But I'll be here, I promise I'll be here

Like the kicker in a julep or two

That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head

With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Tengo tu reflejo, todo lo que soy
Tengo tu mirada, todo lo que soy
Tengo tu respiro, todo lo que soy

Esteman,"No me digas que no es fácil aunque yo, siempre lo vi 
Y no le pidas tiempo al tiempo, yo no voy a estar siempre aquí 
Porque soy de los que se lleva la lluvia soy, de los que se va 
Soy de los que no tienen fortuna, soy de los que no están 

Tantas promesas, juramentos e ilusiones 
Las palabras importantes son acciones, no actuaciones 
No te mientas más, no me engañes más, no más. 

No me hables con toda esa pretensión, 
De una estrella del pop 
No me digas que tu escribiste esta canción 
Para alzar mis lamentos 

Pero soy el que pudo llevarte a la luna
Soy, el que te llevó, 
Soy el que pudo saltar una duna
Soy, el que te salvó. 

Tantas promesas, juramentos e ilusiones 
Las palabras importantes son acciones, no actuaciones 
No te mientas más, no me engañes más, no más

Son, pocas razones para estar aquí
Resistir para no existir 
O existir para no mentir, yendo hacia adelante. 
Vamos adelante, vamos adelante 
Vamos adelante

Tantas promesas, juramentos e ilusiones 
Para estar juntos tu y yo, lo siento, no es el tiempo 
No te mientas más, no me engañes más, no más",Adelante
Esteman,"Te conocí en un mundo donde no hay fronteras
Llegaba cada noche como vez primera
¿Acaso no supiste lo que pasaría?
Formaste las raíces de mi vida entera
Y no sé, como hacer
Si no estás en mis días

Junto a ti, sin pensar, volvería
Ah, ah
Te seguiré esperando
Ah, ah

Y pasarán los días
Ah, ah
Aunque el tiempo se equivoque
Junto a mi bailarás, por el resto de la vida

En una noche blanca nos miraba el cielo ¡oh!
Lo que el futuro traiga no nos preocupaba mmm

Porque es que nuestra historia nunca terminaba
Por siempre seguiría y eso es lo que espero
Y por qué no volver a lo que nos unía
Yo por ti buscaré la salida

Ah ah
Te seguiré esperando
Ah ah
Y pasarán los días
Ah ah aunque el tiempo se equivoque
Junto a mi bailarás por el resto de la vida

No quise preocuparme por lo nuestro
Las cosas parecían estar claras
La vida continuaba y nos alejaba
Es cierto que de lejos nos queremos
Y yo de lejos te siento tan cerca
Contigo el desenlace y lo que nos queda
Hace tiempo que te quiero aquí a mi lado
Gritarte lo que siento

Vivir los momentos que el tiempo ha dejado
Porque contigo comprendí y conocí con quien vivir en el futuro
Y abrazar en el pasado
Son tus ojos, son tus besos y tu risa

No te miento es tu vida con la mía, la canción que siempre espero
Porque aún te siento cerca como vez primera
Ah ah
Te seguiré esperando
Ah ah
Y pasarán los días
Ah ah
Aunque el tiempo se equivoque
Junto a mi bailarás por el resto de la vida
Son tus ojos, son tus besos y tu risa
No te miento ¡oh! por el resto de la vida
Es tu vida con la mía, la canción que siempre espera
¡Eh! Por el resto de la vida
Son tus ojos, son tus besos & tu risa
No te miento ¡oh! por el resto de la vida
Es tu vida con la mía, la canción que siempre espera
Porque aún te siento cerca como vez primera",Como Vez Primera

Love's a crazy game 
Two people vow to stay 
In love as one they say 

But all is changed with time 
The future no one can see 
The road you leave behind 
Ahead lies mystery 

But all is fair in love 
I had to go away 
A writer takes his pen 
To write the words again 
That all in love is fair 

All of fate's a chance 
It's either good or bad 
I tossed my coin to say 
In love with me you'd stay 

But all in war is so cold 
You either win or lose 
When all is put away 
The losing side I'll play 

But all is fair in love 
I should never have left your side

Mes papiers militaires
Pour partir à la guerre
Avant mercredi soir

Je ne veux pas la faire
Je ne suis pas sur terre

Too soon, too soon,

That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Cut me into little pieces

Who if He really does exist
Why did He desert me?

Broken in the world that can't be mended
Left unattended

Looking back over the years
And whatever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears
And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start with a heart so badly broken
Despite encouragement from me

Stand as far away from me as you can and ask me why

Hang on to your rosary beads
Close your eyes to watch me die
You keep sayin', kick it, quit it
Kick it, quit it, kick it, quit it

God, but did you ever try to turn your sick soul
Inside out so that the world can watch you die
Home is where I live, inside my white power dreams
Home was once an empty vacuum that's filled now
With my silent screams

Home is where the needle marks
Try to hear my broken heart
And it might not be such a bad idea

Esther Phillips,"Every time we say goodbye, I die a little
Every time we say goodbye, I wonder why a little
Why the gods above me, who must be in the know
think so little of me that they allow you go

When your near there's such an air of Spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere begin to sing about it
There's no love song finer but how strange
The change from major to minor
Every time we say goodbye",Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye
Esther Phillips,"I could have told you she would hurt you,
She'd love you awhile and desert you,
If only you'd asked I could have told you so!
I could have saved you some crying,
Yes, I could have told you she was lying,
But you were in love and you didn't want to know.

I hear her now as I toss and turn and try to sleep,
I hear her now making promises she'll never keep;
And now it's over and done with,
She'll find someone new to have fun with!
Through all of my tears I could have told you so.

Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!

This is where our story ends,
Never lovers, ever friends.

Goodbye, Let our hearts call it a day,
But before you walk away,
I sincerely want to say:

I wish you bluebirds in the Spring,
To give your heart a song to sing;
And then a kiss, but more than this I wish you love.

And in July, a lemonade,
To cool you in some leafy glade;
I wish you health and more than wealth, I wish you love.
My breaking heart and I agree
That you and I could never be,
So with my best, my very best, I set you free.

I wish you shelter from the storm,
A cozy fire to keep you warm;
But most of all, when snowflakes fall,
I wish you love.

Y en cada verso pone su corazón
Al yuyo de suburbio su voz perfuma

Tal vez allá en la infancia su voz de alondra

Tomo ese tono oscuro de callejón
O acaso aquel romance que solo nombra
Cuando se pone triste con el alcohol

Malena canta el tango con voz de sombra
Malena tiene pena de bandoneón

Tu canción tiene el frío
Del último encuentro
Tu canción se hace amarga
En la sal del recuerdo

Yo no sé si tu voz es la flor de una pena
Solo sé que al rumor de tus tangos, Malena

Te siento más buena
Más buena que yo

Tus tangos son criaturas abandonadas
Que cruzan sobre el barro del callejón
Cuando todas las puertas están cerradas
Y ladran los fantasmas de la canción

Malena canta el tango con voz quebrada
Malena tiene pena de bandoneón

For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart
Esther Williams,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is

How can you make your way through the world today
When everybody is so angry?
And what we hear affects our hearts
There's got to be a better way to communicate
So show your love not hate

We are in need of a musical revolution

We are in need of some spiritual evolution
(We're so tired of the same old, same old)
We are in need of love, we are in need of love

I'm calling, calling, I'm calling out, calling you
Doesn't anybody wanna do something new?

I'm calling all creators in the movement
It's time to offer a solution to the dilution of what we love
And the greats would be so disappointed
'Cause we've sold our souls for what we don't own anymore

We are in need of love
Lets start a musical revolution
(We're so tired of the same old)
We are in need of some lyrical evolution

I'm so sick and tired of the shit on the radio
And MTV they only play the same thing
No matter where I go, I see Ashanti in the video
I want something
'Cause I'm sick and tired of the shit on the radio
And MTV they only play the same thing
No matter where I go, I see Britney on my video screen
I want something more
Let's start a musical revolution
I want something more
Lets start a musical revolution

Tell me why a grown man can rape a little girl
But we still hear his shit on the radio
A grown-ass man can videotape a little girl
But we still see his mug up on our video screens

Esthero,"Crashed down on the floor, hold your breath and fall apart.
You made a simple mistake and now you’re praying for a better heart.
Some of us make our own beds, we can’t afford to lay in them.
Remember I always have said you should leave me alone.

‘Cause I don’t wanna crash, now I’m afraid
That I’m going nowhere way too fast.
And I can’t hear what you say, I’m in a conversation with my past.
And maybe you wasn’t the brave, so much the praising what it got me through.
And somehow the path that I’ve paved just keeps leading me to you.

But I don’t wanna crash now,
Don’t wanna crash now.

I shouldn’t ever be afraid to lay you down,
I just wanna hold you in my arms again.
If only for a moment I could have you here.
Lady, I would never let you go.

‘Cause I don’t wanna crash now,
I don’t wanna crash now.

Come on in the sun,
When you’re scared, can face it down.
‘Cause here I am, you will not be alone.

Keep facing the sun, you’ll reach it one day,
Bame it on the back ‘till you can watch with me
And you mean to be free.
And when the sun goes down, there’s still tomorrow,
Don’t you be afraid to let your sorrow breathe.
Your strength is all you need.

Did you ever know you were the one?
‘Cause I can hardly even tell.",Crash
Esthero,"I feel the world lift away when you put your arms around me
I close my eyes, melt away, your own roller coaster ride, so exciting

You do something that I can't explain
'cause it's supernatural, supernatural
You know you're blowing me away
'cause it's supernatural, supernatural
Like the dancing of a novel on earth, babe
Like the star that shoots across the sky
This doesn't happen every day
'cause you're supernatural, supernatural

Put some note on the world and dancing with excitement
There's nothing like you in the world
I wanna explode with you, like a firework
And I want you in my life, because you're so magnificent

You do something that I can't explain

I'm all alone, do you hear the thunder
It's sounding off when we're together, 
Do you wanna know
Do you ever wonder why there's a light in my eyes
It's you and I

Nur am Bauen, dicke Knollen, brauchen Bass aus den Boxen
Bruder, bisschen chillen, einfach genießen den Tag
Meine Homies sind am Start und die Drogen gehen klar
Wir rauchen Haze, baby, safe hier im Viertel wird gedreht
Dicke Dinger oder mal wieder einen richtig fetten J
Mach mal halblang, bin mal wieder zu stoned
Ich bin der Shit, viel zu dope, Bro wie Hits from the Bong
Kleine Bitches auf witzig gefickt auf meinem Trip
Im Rausch eingeschlafen und am nächsten Tag zisch ich
Meine Art ziemlich high, vom Prinzip

Wache auf und bin verwirrt
Weiß nicht, ob der Schmerz irgendwann mal vergeht
Doch Mama, du fehlst
Ich hab dich schon so lang nicht gesehen, nein
Und ich hoff' es geht dir gut wo du jetzt bist
Ja, ich hab es dir versprochen, drum versuche ich mein Glück
Mum, ich tu' das hier für dich

Ich möchte, dass du eines Tages Stolz auf mich sein kannst
Und ich weiß es wird kein leichtes Spiel
Ich würde mich freuen, wenn du mir ab und zu ein Zeichen gibst
Denn manchmal komm' ich klar, doch manchmal halt ich es nicht aus
Ey, manchmal denk' ich heut noch immer du kommst bald wieder nach Haus und denk

Ey, ich erinner' mich, ich war während der Schulzeit nicht leicht, nein
Und im Nachhinein tut es mir leid
Wir hatten jeden Morgen streit, denn ich kam nicht aus dem Bett
Hab die ganze Nacht gekifft und gerappt
Du hast alles versucht
Ich war draußen, baute Scheiße mit den Jungs
Doch ich hätte mir mehr Zeit nehmen sollen für uns, denn jetzt ist es zu spät und du bist nicht mehr da
Und alles was mir bleibt sind Besuche an deinem Grab
Ich verfluche diesen Tag, ich wünscht ich könnt den Zeiger nochmal drehen
Doch muss mir eingestehen, dass es wohl einfach nicht mehr geht
Und manchmal komm' ich klar, doch manchmal halt ich es nicht aus
Ey, manchmal denk' ich noch immer du kommst bald wieder nach Haus und denk

Um den Schein, denn hier zählt man selbst wenig
Keine Zeit für eine Pause, denn die Zukunft sie rast
Gestern Züge, morgen buchen wir einen Flug hoch zum Mars
Warten ständig darauf, dass wir Apps empfangen
Scheint so als wären wir im Netz gefangen
Die schlausten Texte stammen aus nem Tumblr Blog
Wenn man nicht mitspielt bleibt man wohl ein Underdog
Standard-Schrott wird von den Medien serviert
Manchmal fühl' ich mich fremd wie ein Alien hier
Ey die ewige Gier nach den Statussymbolen
Wird gepredigt und wir glauben Stars und Idolen
Die wenigsten hier gehen ihren eigenen Pfad
Denn der eigene Pfad wirkt oft steinig und hart
Ich versuch' nur ein kühlen Kopf zu bewahren
Und weiß, ich komm an mit bisschen Hoffnung und Plan

Ich schalt ab, gerade staut sich so viel
Ich schalt ab, ich schalt ab

Viel zu viele Dinge, die den Reiz überfluten
Manchmal will ich alles um mich rum einfach nur muten
Das letzte mal waren wir wirklich frei in der Jugend
Und zwar frei von den täglichen Zwängen
Anstatt, dass wir gehetzt durch die Gegend hier rennen
Auf der Jagd nach den Dingen die das Leben beengen
Nach dem Lifestyle den wir aus den Medien kennen
Uns fehlen die Antennen für das Wesentliche
In hundert Jahren sind wir eh Geschichte
Unsere Treffen sind nur digital
Das sind Gedanken während ich grad durch die City fahr', ah
Ich will mich nicht über den Fortschritt beschweren
Doch glaub mir, hier an diesem Ort gibt's noch mehr
Wer weiß ob wir auf dem richtigen Kurs waren
Ich muss anhalten, abschalten, durchatmen

Ich schalt ab, ich brauch das Ventil
Ich schalt ab, gerade staut sich so viel
Ich schalt ab, ich schalt ab
Und all dieser Stress hier prallt ab

Schon in der vierten Klasse war sie immer super gestylt
Doch Mädchen wie sie bringen's in der Schule nicht weit
Ihre Schuhe passen gut zu dem Kleid
Ich will nix sagen doch auf teuer machen ist schon seit der Jugend vorbei
Auf der Suche nach den großen Fischen
Und den vollen Taschen
Wer steht hier ohne Mische? Wer hat im Club die Flaschen?
Wer macht auf dem Klo Backstage das Koks klar
Und mit'n bisschen Glück gibt's nen Lapdance zum Hochfahren
Oh ja, sie weiß was sie tut, sie kennt alle Tricks
C-Promi Partys und Duckface auf allen Pics
Keine Frage, sie weiß ganz genau wie's funktioniert
Und für den Weg den sie gehen möchte, braucht sie nie studieren

Obwohl ihre Eltern tierisch Acht geben
Verkehrt sie viel im Nachtleben
Sie ist grad süße Achtzehn, will einen reichen Mann
Doch lässt sich von vielen flachlegen

Sie ist grad süße Achtzehn, aber hat schon einiges erlebt
Und von manchen Dingen sollt' sie besser keinem was erzählen
Jede Woche bei 'nem anderen in nem dreier BMW
Ey die Kleine kann sich schon ne ganze Weile nicht benehmen
Und das ganze immer wieder aufs neue
Sie lässt sich einladen, wickelt Typen um den Finger so, dass sie nicht nein sagen
Und irgendwann mal beißt der Richtige an
Vielleicht war er schon da, sie hat ihn nicht mal erkannt
Doch kein Problem, sie bleibt hartnäckig
Und baggert bei jedem Dritten
Denn reiche Männer werden schwach bei ihren gefakten Titten
Und ist der Ring erst einmal fest an ihrem Finger dran
Hängt sie ihm paar Kinder an und schwub-di-wups gelingt der Plan

Verkehrt sie viel im Nachtleben

Estuve en casa dormido
Tampoco que hací­a mi coche
En la puerta del bar del olvido

No preguntes si es que estaba
De fiesta con los amigos
Que mis respuestas son balas
Para tu corazón herido
Pero si me dejas esta noche yo te doy
Todos los besos que te debo
Ya sé que siempre digo que empiezo a partir de hoy
y que luego nunca me atrevo
Pero si me dejas yo te canto una bossanova

Las miradas perdías, los codos en la barra
En fin cerveza fría por mi garganta

Cuando entró un tipo bajito, pero eso si bacilón
Que poseía todo lo que el bar quería
Un toque mágico pa la aficción
Porque será

y el tipo era una máquina, un pasao de página, como las colaba
Como presionaba en fin se divertía y toda la gente le cantaba

Invitando a la peña, invitando a cañas
A la hija de la dueña la tienes loca loquita loca

Pero la suerte a veces cambia de banda

y el viejo de la niña salto la barra

y toda la gente le cantaba

Cuento tantos cuentos que ni quentin cuenta tantos
Desde Cenicienta, hasta el llanero solitario

Te amo mas y mas

To stain the soul so pure
To wake the heart of the fallen

Please come with your might

Can't watch him dying

Break the back of the light

Kill the hordes of the sun
Let the dark age be begun

Let the blade of dark incise
As the moon of blood arises
Your master orders you

As the black dawn greets up all

We have to know writings of the sacred signs

I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door

See I was on the verge of breaking down

And now we're standing face to face

You go and save the best for last

When some silly girl had set you free

What about our freedom and this piece of ground
We didn't get to keep 'em by backing down

Before you start your preaching
Let me ask you this my friend

Have you forgotten how it felt that day
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell
We had neighbors still inside
Going through a living hell
And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout Bin Laden
Have you forgotten

They took all the footage off my TV
Said it's too disturbing for you and me
It'll just breed anger that's what the experts say
If it was up to me I'd show it everyday
Some say this country's just out looking for a fight
After 9/11 man I'd have to say that's right

Have you forgotten how it felt that day
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell
We had neighbors still inside
Going through a living hell
And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout Bin Laden

I've been there with the soldiers
Who've gone away to war
And you can bet that they remember
Just what they're fighting for

I found a heart just a little bit truer

Funny 'cause I'd love to go travelin'

It's a phenomenon
We could pool our resources
By joining forces from now on

Is misery

Ethel Merman,"The night is young, the skies are clear 
So if you want to go walking, dear,

I understand the reason why 
You're sentimental, 'cause so am I, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely.

What a swell night this is for romance, 
You can hear dear Mother Nature

The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse 
While you crucify the verse.

The Tin-Pantithesis of a melody, 

So spare us all the pain, 
Just skip the darn thing and sing the refrain...

I've never seen you shine so bright
I've never seen so many men ask you if you wanted to dance
They're looking for a little romance, given half a chance
I have never seen that dress you're wearing
Or the highlights in your head that catch your eyes I have been blind
The lady in red is dancing with me cheek to cheek
There's nobody here, it's just you and me, It's where I wanna be 
But I hardly know this beauty by my side
I'll never for get, the way you look tonight

I've never seen you looking so gorgeous as you did tonight
I've never seen you shine so bright you were amazing
I've never seen so many people want to be there by your side

For when you lay off the liquor, you feel so much slicker
Well that is, most of the time
But there are moments, sooner or later
When it's tough, I got to say, love to say, Waiter

Make it another old-fashioned, please
Make it another, double, old-fashioned, please
Make it for one who's due to join the disillusion crew
Make it for one of love's new refugees

Once high in my castle, I ran to you
And oh what a castle, built on a heavenly dream
Then quick as a lightning flash, that castle began to crash
So, make it another old-fashioned, please

Leave out the orange, 
Leave out the bitters

Looking everywhere, haven't found her yet
She's the big affair I cannot forget
Only girl I ever think of will regret

I'd like to add her initial to my monogram
Tell me where's the shepherd for this lost lamb

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that she turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

I'm a little lamb who's lost in a wood
I know I could always be good
To one who'll watch over me

Although she may not the girl some men think of

Ethel Merman,"People are queer, they're always crowing, scrambling and rushing about

We're not here to stay; we're on a short holiday

Life is just a bowl of cherries
Don't take it serious; it's too mysterious
You work, you save, you worry so
But you can't take your dough when you go, go, go

So keep repeating it's the berries

The sweet things in life, to you were just loaned
So how can you lose what you've never owned?

So live and laugh at it all

Life is just a bowl of cherries
Don't take it serious; it's too mysterious
At eight each morning I have got a date
To take my plunge 'round the Empire State

There's a guy in the show, the girls love to kiss
Get thousands a week just for crooning like this

And it seemed to say
There you go
There you go

How I felt as I fell I just can't recall
But his arms held me fast and it broke the fall

And I said to my heart
As it foolishly kept jumping all around
I got lost but look what I found

Life was serene, I knew where I was at

I was something dragged in by the cat. Then

Just in time, I found you just in time
Before you came my time was running low
I was lost, the losing dice were tossed
My bridges all were crossed, nowhere to go

We'd have been aware that our love affair

As time came around, she came

And these few golden days I'd share with you

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Ethel Merman,"[On a late night in the spring of 1827 
The city of Vienna is experiencing the largest lightning storm in its long history. 
Within a large disheveled room, 
Ludwig Von Beethoven is slumped over his piano 
And on the piano sits the just completed manuscript for his tenth symphony. 
It is his final, and he is certain, his greatest work.]

Since the time when ra and isis
Raised the sphinx out of the sand
And apollo dreamed athena
And men began to understand

That when darkness folds on darkness
In the restless tides of night
And lightning raises shadows
And for moments gives them life

It's been said by those who ponder
That it surely is a sign
That a life touched by the stars
Is now running out of time

And that somewhere in that darkness
In the heart of that great storm
The world returns a soul
That the gods caused to be born

And this was such a storm
The kind one rarely sees in life
For in a room now filled with shadows
The great Beethoven was spending

His last night

[From the shadows a beautiful spirit, fate, 
And her deformed dwarf son, twist, 
Emerge to inform Beethoven of what he has already deeply suspected, 
That this is to be his last night on earth. 
They are accompanied by numerous spirits and ghosts from his past.]",Overture

Boy, how they could love!
Swore to be true to each other,
True as the stars above!
'Cause he was her man,
But he done her wrong!

One night Frankie happened to pass by the hotel;
Just casually glanced into a window so high,
And who did she see but her lovin' man
Lovin' up old Nellie Bligh!
She caught her man
Doin' her wrong!

Well, she went round the corner to her favourite pawn shop;
This time she didn't go there for fun!
'Cause when she left, underneath her long red kimono,
She was totin' a forty-four gun!
She was gunnin' for her man
Who was doin' her wrong!

Then back Frankie dashed to that hotel,
Started yankin' the bell!
She said, ""Stand back, you madam and floozies,
Or I'll blow each and every one of you straight to hell!
I want my man
Who's done me wrong!"".

Johnnie, in panic, mounted the staircase,
Screamin', ""Oh Frankie, don't shoot!""
Three times she pulled a trigger on a forty-four gun,
The gun went, ""Root-toot-toot!"".
She nailed her man
Who'd done her wrong!

So they put her away in a dungeon,
Way up in a dark dingy cell
In the south east corner of a jail,
Where the wind seemed to blow straight from hell!
For killin' her man
Who done her wrong!

But the day Frankie mounted the scaffold,
She was just as calm as any gal could be!
And raising her eyes to heaven she cried,
""Lord, I'm comin' to thee!
I'm sorry I killed my man
Who done me wrong!"".",Frankie and Johnny

Lonesome midnight blues.

Ethel Waters,"No use of talkin' no use of talkin'
You'll start in dog-walkin' no matter where.
There's jazz-copation blues modulation,
Just like a Haitian you'll rip and tear.
Most everybody likes the blues

Here's why I'm ravin', here's why I'm ravin'
If it's blues you are cravin' just come on down.
You'll hear 'em playin', you'll hear 'em playin'
Soon you'll be sayin', ""Hon jazz me 'round""
Because your feet they can't refuse.

What's that familiar strain that true blue note refrain
It's drivin' me insane;
Can't keep still, Tho it's against my will;
I'm on my P's and Q's I just can't refuse.

There goes that melody, it sounds so good to me,
And I am up a tree;
It's a shame, you don't know the name;
It's a brand new blues, The Royal Garden Blues.

Everybody Grab somebody And start jazzing 'round

Hon don't you hear that trombone moan?, Just listen to that saxophone.
Gee, hear that clarinet and flute, Cornet jazzin' with a mute,
Makes me just throw myself away, When I hear 'em play.

That weepin' melancholy strain, Say, but it's soothing to the brain;
Just wanna get right up and dance, Don't care I'll take most any chance;
No other blues I'd care to choose, But Royal Garden Blues.",Royal Garden Blues
Ethel Waters,"Have you heard it, have you heard it, 
That Da Da Strain? 
It will shake you, it will make you

Makes you watch your every step.

Starts to lay 'em down, 

Everybody when they hear it 
Starts to buzzing 'round; 
I get crazy as a loon, 
When everybody hums this tune:

So now I'm worried, 

Lonesome and blue. 
I've got the blues on my mind,

And I was feeling all sad and blue, 
I had nobody to tell my troubles to; 
I felt so worried, 
I didn't know what to do. 

But there's no use in grievin', because I'm leavin',

And ever since she came, 
The colored folks all claim, ""Say,"" 

No gal made has got a shade on Sweet Georgia Brown, 
Two left feet, oh, so neat, 
Has Sweet Georgia Brown! 
They all sigh, and want to die, 

For Sweet Georgia Brown!

She knocks 'em dead, 
When she lands in town!

Why it's a shame, 

How she cools them down!

And I believed you were true, yes, I believed in you.

I'll long to fondle and kiss you,
And drive away your fears,

Dat's a rainy day

Ether,"That's a good question
Why am I standing out here alone
I guess I don't know enough to come in from the rain
I was watching your window
From here below
I think I just might stay here all day
Cause I gotta do something

If I can't love you
I don't want to love you
If I can't hold you
I don't want to be thinking of you
And if you don't want me
I don't want to want you
And if you won't see me
I don't know what to do
But oh keep watching you
Until I see right through
Oh I keep watching you

You could throw me down a cigarette
I smoked my last one quite a while ago
No, I gave it to the man that swore he had no need
You know sometimes if I listen real close
I can hear the dark side of the moon
And there's always yesterday's Times if I care to read
And I gotta do something

If I can't love you
I don't want to love you
If I can't hold you
I don't want to be thinking of you
And if you don't want me
I don't want to want you
And if you won't see me
I don't know what to do
But oh keep watching you
Until I see right through
Oh I keep watching you

Sure I'm alright
No I'm not very cold
Every now and then I can feel the subway heat
So go on inside
I'll leave you alone
Anyway Bogart's on in the window down the street
And I gotta do something

Ethix,"You push me away, then you're pulling me in
It's hard to huide, the feelings deep down within
I feel that its me, my fault that things went this way
I think of so many things, but think of nothing to say
What can I say?
Its like I tried you, and created fake emotions
I got so attached to something that was not real
But starting out the whole thing was so easy
Now that its ending, I can't stand how bad I feel 
If I can leave why can't I let go?
Let go
Sometimes I think that, this could be the right thing
But we were kidding ourselves with these fake feelings
If I leave maybe we could just forget
Take some time to breath, and try try to erase regret
What can I say
But you just flood my mind, good thoughts make my day worse
Wishing things could've been different, different without her!
If I can leave, then why can't I just go?
If I can leave, then why do I keep saying no?
If I can leave then why can't you leave too?
If I can leave, why can't I let go?
Let go",Let Go
Ethix,"Broken by your forgiveness and they still act like nothing has changed at all now. 
They don't want you around so you just bring them down. 
You'll bring this all down, and watch it all fall. 
Bring this all down, and watch it all fall. 
Crying like they even care, they just used you. 
Forget who you were there and it hurts. 
I feel for you now, I know it hurts. 
But now that's just too much, yea they messed up. 
It's too much, yeah, they messed up. 
You'll bring this all down, and watch it all fall. 
From the beginning I felt sorry for you. 
And now I do the same things that you do. 
I know that someday, I'll finally come around.

aucune larme dans nos yeux
à l'heure où la première étoile scintille
et que le ciel change de teinte
aucune larme dans nos yeux
des adieux très heureux
confiants de retrouver
un jour intact les bonheurs passés
les alizés passeront les nuages lourds et l'oppressante obscurité
alors que moi je prendrai congé sans cérémonie
je disparaitrai dans la nuit

aucune larme dans nos yeux
des adieux très heureux
et sans regret s'éclipser
sans regrets s'éclipser
s'éclipser
pour mieux se retrouver toi et moi ensemble, ensemble
à nouveau toi et moi ensemble, ensemble
fertiles et féconds, toi et moi transmettre, ensemble
couler des jours heureux ensemble, ensemble
et décoller, s'envoler, ensemble, ensemble…
enfin…",Des Adieux Trés Heureux

J'aimerais que cette nuit dure toute la vie

En partant tu m'as mis le cœur à l'envers
Sans toi la vie est devenue un enfer
Entortillé dans mes draps je crois me souvenir de toi
Lorsque tu disais tout bas que tu n'aimais que moi

Tout ce qui se passe au dehors m'indiffère
Que le monde saute ce n'est pas mon affaire
Dans ces draps bleus traîne encore l'odeur de tes cheveux
Ce bleu infiniment bleu que j' trouvais dans tes yeux

Between you and me, it's difficult to be two
Because to be two, you must be skilful
To be three makes it difficult to be with you
Between you and me, your turmoils
When you are loved, it doesn't matter

Between you and me, it's difficult to be two
Because to be you, you've got to be skillful
More than three makes it difficult to be with you
Between you and me, your frolics/movements

Between you and me, it's difficult to be two
Because to be two, you must be skillful

When someone loves you, when someone loves you, it's doesn't matter
When someone loves you, when someone loves you, it doesn't matter
When someone loves you, when someone loves you, it doesn't matter

If you had the sense of humor
You would laugh to beat the band

Look at yourself
Do you still believe in rumor
That romance is simply grand?

Since you took it right on the chin
You have lost that bright
Toothpaste grin

My mental state is all a jumble
I sit around and sadly mumble

Fools rush in, so here I am
Very glad to be unhappy

Unrequited loves a bore
And I've got it pretty bad
But for someone you adore
It's a pleasure to be sad

Like a straying baby lamb
With no mammy and no pappy
I'm so unhappy but oh, so glad

Don’t you cry, hold your head up high
Don’t give up, give love one more try
There’s a right girl for every guy

Although your love wasn’t right for me
Good for another it will, maybe
Some girls were just made for some guys
Now I’ve got to make myself realize

That my girl has gone and said goodbye

L'ambition du vainqueur, la sueur du champion
Et le poison sans visage d'un ciel sans nuage
Fredonnent la la la la
Aveuglé par un grand soleil radieux
La la la la
Crever d'une OD de ciel bleu

Mais de loin préférer encore un bonheur dangereux
C'est en allant trop loin que l'on avance un peu
Mais enfin rechercher un bonheur dangereux
C'est en plongeant trop bas que l'on s'élève un peu

Là sous ton parapluie,
Les mirages s’amoncellent
Et le gris ? s'écrit
Où l'on joue pas de parodie de paradis
En sursis

C'est en allant trop loin que l'on avance un peu

Etienne Daho,"Que de temps passé en surface,
Que de temps à ne pas s’encombrer
Du temps et des étoiles tombées.
Que de temps passé en surface.
Je me voulais léger, léger
Du plaisir sans se retourner.
Ce plaisir ne m’allégeait pas,
la beauté n’avait pas de bras.
Je rêvais d’une vie de plumes,
Ignorais la stèle et l’enclume
Je balayais mes propres traces
Que de temps perdu en surface.
Que de temps passé en surface,
Que de temps à ne pas succomber
Au spleen et aux étoiles plombées.
Que de temps passé en surface.
L’éphémère était mon crédo
Et hier, à la mauvaise place.
Je n’aimais pas trop mon cerveau,
Mon corps envahissait l’espace.
Et puis j’ai vu bouger la surface
Tout le temps venant à déborder.
Je pensais ne pas y penser,
Oui mais nos pensées nous dépassent
Et j’ai glissé sur la surface,
Délesté de la légèreté.
J’ai compté les étoiles tombées
Et claqué le temps passé en surface.
Que de temps passé en surface.
Que de temps à ne pas s’encombrer
Du temps et des étoiles tombées.
Que de temps passé en surface.",En Surface

J'étais là très tôt ce matin
Je te cherchais
A vive allure, le passé nous rattrape
Je me demande si j'ai eu raison
Et me voici à Rome,
Devant chez toi

L'escalier monte à sa chambre, et dans
Ce froid de gueux
L'enfant du roi fou

En bras de chemise légère, dans,
Son âme, tous nos mystères,
De Berlin, de Moscou

Des photos d'un ado sombre accrochées
Au mur là, devant lui,
Il se voit, est-ce lui? Est-ce lui?

Je t'ai attendu dans ce rade triste,
Il était trop tôt pour ma défaite.

L'escalier monte à sa chambre,
Et dans le froid de décembre,
Son accent français le trahit

En bras de chemise légère,
Dans ses yeux, tous nos mystères,
De Marseille à Paris

Des photos d'un ado sombre,
Accrochées au mur, devant lui,
Est-ce moi? Est-ce lui?

Comme le héros d'un livre,
Qui ne souffrirait plus du froid,

Two roads, both which insist
He'll tug at my earlobe and he'll whisper
You are what you resist

Sometimes there's a devil sittin' on my shoulder
And I can't find an angel to help me decide
Oh he's gettin heavy as I get older
I've got to find me
An angel someday

Angel are you coming
Or did you give up
I spent all my credit
And pushed all my luck
But these days
I can hardly hold him down
His strength is my crutch
Oh white feathered angel I am waiting
Am I just asking too much

Sometimes there's a devil sittin' on my shoulder
What is it about me he just won't go away
And though we have gotten to like eachother
I've gotta find me
An Angel

He's got a smile that charms me plenty
He'll take dessert before his food
He gives delicious conversation
And then he makes sure
That he's been....understood

I'll never let him go

I found out I could fly

And jump back into the fire

Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another
For I'm not free
She's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Up on my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love.

I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could, always be good
To one who'll watch over me

In the morning and you wonder
Why no one's beside you where I usually lay
And you think you hear
The sound of a distant thunder
It's just your old rock rolling away

I was your rock standing strong for you
There was nothing I wouldn't do
No matter the cost I was ready to pay
Now you say I'm only holding you down
Like some old rock you've been dragging around
Yes, I'm your rock but I'm rolling away

I'm rolling away on a downhill grade
But I'm coming to rest side
A mountain of love some day
'Cause I finally understand
If you're resting on shifting sands
Even a rock goes rolling away

On a one-horse open sleigh,
Over the fields we go,
Laughing all the way;
Bells on bob-tail ring,
making spirits bright,

A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago,
I thought I'd take a ride,
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank;
Misfortune seemed his lot;
He got into a drifted bank,
And we, we got upsot.

Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

A day or two ago,
the story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there
I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

Go it while you're young,

Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth.

For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!

O night, O holy night, O night divine!
O night, O holy night, O night divine!

With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.

Now come the wisemen from out of the Orient land.
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another,
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.

With all our hearts we praise His holy name.

Like the kicker in a julep or two

Cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be

Etta James,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",He's Funny That Way

But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget

He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too

Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms

What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

How it all got started, how it all begin
God made the heavens, God made the earth
Made a man and a woman out of blood, sweat and dirt

And He said to His self, ""This is good""

God made the rivers and the mountains with his hands
God made the wind to blow the shifting sands
He put the fishes in the, in the deep blue sea
Filled up the garden with flowers and the trees
And God looked around the neighborhood
And He said to His self, ""This is good""

But the devil he was jealous, took the apple in his hand
The devil tempted woman and woman tempted man
God, He mourned and the tears rolled down His face
It broke His heart to see His children fall from grace
And on the seventh day they say, ""God rested""
But you know that ain't the truth

Cause on the seventh day, God made the blue
Cause on the seventh day, God made the blue

The blues is been around ever since that day
Everybody gets the blues, everybody got to pay
For the wicked things we do
And what we put each other through
