This is the story she told...

""Can I have another quarter?"" he said.
""What?""
""Can I have another quarter?""
""Why?"" she said.
""Uh, I dropped it,"" he said.
""Sure,"" she said, and she handed him another quarter.
And he reached out of the window there, and dropped it in the toll basket.
Up comes the gate, and out comes...

Johnny's camero, Johnny's camero
Johnny loved his camero, maybe more than life itself.

Oh it was no big deal, he was just taking her to the airport.
It was autumn in New York City,
There was a wind a lot like this.
It was springtime however, in Africa.
She'd been saving up her money.
She was going to go on one of these outward bound trips,
So he was just giving her a ride to the airport.
And around and around the airport they went,
Through that parking garage, looking for a parking space.
""There's one,"" she said.
""No.""
""There's one,"" she said.
""No.""
You see, actually it takes two parking spaces...

for Johnny's camero, Johnny's camero

He's a little nervous walking through the airport.
He's always looking back over his shoulder.
""You can go back if you want,"" she said.
""No, no man, I'll stay.""
And he did. He stayed until the plane took off.
Then he ran back.
But meanwhile, she was high up over the city.
She was looking down.
She was looking down at the lights of the buildings.
She was looking down at the lights of the boats on the water.
She was looking down at the lights.
You could see them crossing the bridges,
And through the little canyon streets.
Little tiny, diamond toward you and ruby away.
You know, those little tiny moving lights.
And she knew that one of them was... well you know.

Man, I've got to tell you about the adventure she had in Africa.
I think I should start with the silver bracelet,
I think that's where it all turns around.
She hadn't been on the trip long and one of the guides sort of
Took her under his wing.
'Cause she was sort of startled easy,
She was a little nervous about being out there.
The first time she got sunburned through her hat
She realized she was a long way from being home.
She had just left the group for a little while one day,
She had just went to take a pee,
She said ""I'll be right back,"" but she didn't come back for awhile.
And this guide, this African man went to look for her.
""Laura! Laura?""
He found her standing on the lowest branch of a fairly tall tree,
Way off the ground.""
""How you get up there?""
Well she had jumped.
""Why?""
Well there was a hyena, and they had told her about hyenas.
They have jaws that can crush bone.
She wasn't in a really confident position anyway,
And she just ran, and there was the branch.
She jumped - one hand slipped, one hand held.
She was not coming down.
""He's gone.""
So now she trusted him, and she swings back down
And both arms straight, hanging from that branch,
Her feet are four feet off the ground.
Man, she didn't know she could jump that high.
Ah, but she does now.

It was changes like that that made him give her that silver bracelet.
It was the one that he'd always wear kind of between his elbow
And his shoulder, kind of wrapped tight around his arm.
It was a beautiful silver bracelet, and he bent it down to fit around
Her muscle there and she smiled.
So much so that it startled him.
So much so that on the last day of that trip, when they were getting
Back on the bus to go to the small airport to go to the big airport
To go across the ocean to go back to... you know,
When they were getting back on the bus and she leaned out the window
For that last little cheesecake snapshot
And as he looked through the camera, he had to slowly take the camera
Down, and turn his head to the side a little bit, look a little bit
Sad and say
""How you get up there?""

She was dreaming over the ocean
Dreaming of being home again
Dreaming over the ocean
Of what would never be the same.

Well he wasn't at the gate when she got into the airport.
He must have been looking for a parking space.
So she just walked through the airport, you know,
And it wasn't like before.
Now the airport seemed kind of small.
The airport seemed kind of stuffy, ceiling was a little bit low.
And everyone was getting out of her way.
I don't know - well, actually I do know.
Maybe it was because it had been winter, you see,
And she had just come back from summer.
And she was just dressed normally. Everyone else was bundled up,
But she had on her hiking boots and shorts and tank top,
Hair tied back, and a knife on her belt, and a big old silver bracelet,
I think it was the silver bracelet,
But everybody was getting out of her way.
She didn't see him 'til the backpack comes rolling down the
Old baggage claim, and suddenly there's this arm
And this voice saying, ""I'll get that.""
And she says, ""Hey, that's my backpack, gimme it. Where you parked?""
So he reluctantly gave her the backpack,
And she swung it over her shoulder
And they went out and carefully nestled it in the trunk

And then, out of the parking garage and into the city.
And she had to lean out the window,
She pushed the button and made the window go down
And she leaned out a little bit to feel the wind in her hair.
Man, this is the wild place to be.
I mean, this is the place,
She has to lean a little further out of the car just to
Just to see it all, just to look up at some of the buildings.
As a matter of fact, she leaned a little farther back
So she could look back behind
And watch those big tires rolling on that pavement,
And then suddenly the window came back up
And she comes back in, startled
And sure enough Johnny's got his finger on the power...
...the power... the power window.
And he's looking at her like,
""Will you get your feet off the upholstery!""
The upholstery, the upholstery. She forgot. How could she forget?
Well, she'd been in Africa, come on.
She took her feet off the upholstery.
As a matter of fact, she took her feet off the upholstery politely.
As a matter of fact, she folded her hands in her lap
And she settled in for this ride.
I saw just a glint of a smile as she turned her face to one side.
Maybe to feel the plush upholstery brush against her cheek.
Maybe to see the lights of the graphic equalizer on the stereo
Reflected in the side window.
Maybe to watch that lone drop of water make its weary way across
That perfectly waxed surface.
But I think it was just to enjoy this ride...
This ride...
This last ride...

in Johnny's camero, Johnny's camero.

David Wilcox,"I was doing my laundry, baby
I thought I'd do my new jeans too
Yeah, I was doing my laundry
I threw my new blue jeans in too

And when the spin and rinse was over
Every single thing in there was blue

Well, blue on my bedsheets
To wrap around like doom
Blue on my sweatshirt
Blue fruit of the loom

I went to the laundry
I did what you're never supposed to do
I washed a brand new pair of Levi's
Every single thing in there was blue
I had the blues

You see, turned my reds to purple
Yellows gone to green
Even all the browns and grays
Got blue that can't be see

Yeah, the blues got me surrounded
No matter which outfit I choose
Because I just went to the laundry
And got the brand-new pair of Levi blues

Doesn't that really suck?
When you love somebody, and they dick you around,
Doesn't that really suck?

I was driving and crying
I was trying to see
I almost ran down these school kids
Crossing in front of me
As I has my head out the window
I was just trying to explain,
But I just yelled out my wisdom
Like a man insane

When you love somebody, and they dick you around, (yeah)
Doesn't that really suck? (whoo!)
When you love somebody, and they dick you around,
Doesn't that really suck?

We were messy into mango
It was sticking in our teeth
It was too ripe for waiting
It was juicy and sweet
Oh, the succulent sensation
You said it was the best
But you left me in the morning
With that sticky mess!

David Wilcox,"Oh, I know, I'm gonna tell you about
Eastern Mountain Appalachian Roadside Modern Art

Well, I'm gonna drive to West Virginia
Buy myself a shack
Put my good car in the front yard
Block it up on jacks

Then I'm gonna take me a couple wheels off
Roll 'em down into the creek
I'm gonna bust a couple windows
Fix it with a plastic sheet

I got tired of workin' for nothin'
Workin' every day
Bills made me a poor man
But I found a better way

I just built myself a sculpture
A monument to Chevrolet
And now I've got a gallery
Where my front yard used to lay

Well, I'm-a workin' on a '49 Ford
I got it hidden 'round in the backyard
But it's only goin' to be a few days
'Til it's rusted just enough to display

And when I roll it on down by the road
I'll have a monument to Henry Ford
Brought to you by Eastern Mountain
Appalachian Roadside Modern Art, yeah, modern art

So bring your car to West Virginia
Buy your own favorite spot
Get you a big old front yard
Start yourself a parkin' lot

You can roll 'em up on one side
Roll 'em over onto the roof
You can push 'em down into the creek bed
You can leave 'em on the avenue

But hey now, don't you go thinkin' that's just a car
Listen here buddy, that's a work of art
That was America's finest form of transportation
Don't you think it needs just a little celebration

All I'm tryin' to do brought to you by
Eastern Mountain Appalachian Roadside Modern Art
Yeah, modern art

David Wilcox,"The top of my head shines through my haircut
Even when I brush, shape, and style
The top of my head smiles at the young man
Telling me I must have been alive a while

The top of my head shows up in pictures
Don't it make me look so strange?
I guess I only see my used-to-be
And everybody's seen me change

On the top of my head, I got a suntan
My top's down for the sunny day
So strange to be a grown man
Wonder how I got that way?

I can't believe all that time I wasted
Worrying 'bout the hair I lack
Sometimes I catch myself leaned in the mirror
Wondering if it's growing back...
On the top of my head
The top of my head!

Never mind telling me all about distinguished company
Yeah well, sure it looks great on them
But that's a few great men who made a difference in history
You see, it only looks right on a great man

With a lifetime of great things done
Time has got tight, it's gotten late, man
I'd like to think that I have just begun

But there's no sense riding in a big, black Stetson
There's nothing I can hide away
And they say, every hair on the head is counted
So is every single day
Anyway

David Wilcox,"It may look to you like nothing much to see
But you should see the way it feels to me

Here's the sidewalk I used to ride my bike
Down this little slope, down my little mountain
Start by the driveway, spin it up to speed
Be careful of that gravel, 'cause it's nasty on the knees
Watch out for the brances on that apple tree
Soar down to the corner

Well, I guess it's not as high as a remember
It might not be a mountain after all
But it was hard enough to climb
Steep enough to coast
Long enough to satisfy
And fast enough to boast
It may look to you like nothing much to see
But you should see the way it feels to me

Here's the treehouse I used to spend my night
Up this little tree, way up in my mansion
Jump to the first branch, walk it upside down
Be careful of your grip, 'cause it's a long way to the ground
You etter get a handhold before you look around
You can see into forever

Well, I guess it's not as high as I remember
It might not a mansion after all
But it was hard enough to climb
Safe enough to sleep
Big enough to satisfy
And home enough for me
It may look to you like nothing much to see
But you should see the way it feels to me

Here's the old man who used to be the child
So long ago, not so very long ago
Look at the memory, think of all those years
Looking through the sparkle of the sunlight in a tear
You better take another look before you disapear
You can see across your lifetime

So I look at where I've come and where I'm going
I will never be the greatest after all
But it was hard enough to climb
To get to where I've been
Love enough to satisfy
And life enough to live
I may look to you like nothing much to be
But you should see the way it feels to me",You Should See the Way It Feels
David Wilcox,"Well, I'd be dead by thirty-three
That was my best guess
But hey, here I am this morning
Singing happy birthday to me

As I clean up all this mess
Because I'm still left alive
Without warning
In the big, boring middle
Of my long book of life

After the twist has been told
If you don't die in glory
At the age of Christ
Then your story is just getting old

You can see leather-jacket-James
And Jimi, fan the flames
Their posters will always look younger
Ah, but they never knew

And they can't guide us through
The long stretch of spiritual hunger
In the big boring middle
Of my long book of life

After the twist has been told
If you don't die in glory
At the age of Christ
Then your story is just getting old

As a skinny kid she knew
That she should never sell her beauty
But it's a strong narcotic
To feel the public stare

It's like a powerful dose
Of some synthetic self-image
It makes you feel so alive
As long as it is there

And that was how she felt
Not pushed by human hands
She was pushed
By the eyes all around her

So, she fell back into her past
Where her beauty mark would last
So, the camera could never have found her
In the big boring middle
Of my long book of life

After the twist has been told
If you don't die in glory
At the age of Christ
Then your story is just getting old

Now, when Jesus told the rest
That He would have His way
And in death He would not be defeated
Maybe it was all for the best

For what He had to say
Because He would not always
Have to repeat it
Through the big boring middle
Of His long book of life

After He passed thirty-two
If you don't die in glory
At the age of Christ
Then your story is still coming true

Still coming true, still coming true
",Glory
David Wilcox,"Time, this time
Finally the moment is mine
The crowd is wowed
I'm walkin' to the cannon so proud

The cannon fills the spotlight
So shot me to the view
My heart packed full of dynamite
I will fall for you, all for you, baby

See this is your big top baby
And you've got all your clowns around you too
I can hear that drum roll baby
And that means that the torch is to the fuse

Love, true love
I can feel it when I'm high above
But I fall, that's all
I'm your human cannonball

Always dreamed of flyin'
And now the dream comes true
I'm not afriad of dyin'
So I will fall for you, all for you, baby

This is your big top, baby
Yeah, you've got all your clowns around it's true
Why are you just smilin' at me fallin'
Oh, maybe this is keeping you amused

I was the one you wanted
If I could stay that high
If I could burn my sorrow like it was fuel to fly

The sound comes 'round
Now I wake up with my ear to the ground
I rise surprised so this is how a fool gets wise, oh

I'm gonna leave your three-ring-circus
I was a fool to fall
I'm gonna leave your three-ring-circus
Your human cannonball

I'm gonna leave your three-ring-circus
I was a fool to fall
I'm gonna leave your three-ring-circus

I'm gonna leave your three-ring-circus
I was a fool to fall
I'm gonna leave your three-ring-circus

David Wilcox,"I love your sense of humor
I love to see you smile
I love your sense of balance
I love your sense of time

I love your music in the morning
Your rhythm in the night
But it's your kindness
That shines so bright

Yes, I love your beauty
I love your sexy moves
But more I love your honesty
You always tell the truth

I love your vision of the future
Your hope that never dies
But it's your kindness
That clears my skies

Yes, I love your wisdom
Your knowledge of the past
Your willingness to listen
Your taste for what will last

I love your compassion for the suffering
And your solid happiness
But it's your kindness
That I love best

I love, I love, I love
",Kindness
David Wilcox,"Riding out into the night
You know why and where to go
She can't wait to roll you right
She called you up and told you so

Feel the wind now as it cleans away your past
This when you feel your future changing fast
Right now, right now, right now

Keep your mind back on the road
Concentration on the curves
She made time feel slow
She cranked the volume on your nerves

The town is sleeping and the motor's making time
Take it easy, hold it right at ninety-nine
Right now, right now

See the candle in the dawn
Lover's light is burning still
Need some sleep to carry on
Wonder when you ever will

There beside you she is breathing, slow and sweet
She is smiling as you slide under the sheet
Right, right now, right, right now, right, right now
",Right Now
David Wilcox,"This great cold steel that bars the way inside
Was molten when the blacksmith was still living
This dead heavy door that's oak by oak
And all the way across is unforgiving
The inscription tall on that pristine wall behind the steel so rusted
Says, 'Love remains to break the chains of those who would dare to trust it'

Meet me here any night there's a secret church
That's gathered by these gates of steel
A gathering of refugees enough to feel
That we're warm inside with our candles in the wind

We're standing on the outside of these walls alone
The secret church feels taller than cathedral stone
The doors may be locked but they're just doors
Come be welcomed into so much more
Come be welcomed into so much more

Then the wind turned strong when the gathering was done
And the chains upon the bars began to falter down to the floor
From the center of the door fell the lock that was placed on the altar
The inscription tall on the pristine wall behind the steel so rusted
Says, 'Love remains to break the chains of those who would dare to trust it'

Meet me here any night there's a secret church
That's gathered by these gates of steel
A gathering of refugees enough to feel
That we're warm inside with our candles in the wind

As we're standing on the outside of these walls alone
The secret church feels taller than cathedral stone
The doors may be locked but they're just doors
Come be welcomed into so much more
Come be welcome, come be welcomed into so much more
",Secret Church
David Wilcox,"Show me the secret where you keep it
Show me the secret I can see
Show me the secret where you keep it
Show me the key

I love the nights when are timing is right
It fades with the moon up above
That's when memories get made
Never will fade and we feel the depths of our love

But we don't have time for the stars to align
Let's change our fate with desire
So what can I do to get through to you
When you're worried, frightened, and tired

Show me, show me
Show me the secret where you keep it
Show me the key
Show me

When our lives give us time again sometimes we dive right in
Sometimes you're here but gone
When your thinking of things to do and you let it get to you
Seems like you'd rather be alone

And it feels like I've knocked on your door and I'm waiting
You're somewhere inside but don't come
You've got your reasons but sometimes I think that it's me
You're hiding from

Show me, show me
Show me the secret where you keep it
Show me the key
Show me, show me

Show me the key
Show me, show me

",Show Me the Key
David Wilcox,"I used to pray for rescue by burning up my pain
That's the only kind of prayer I knew back then
It was a fire of desperation for any wings in flight
Like a beacon from my lifeboat late at night

As long as I was waiting under the empty sky out there
I would feel that sorrow burning like a rescue flare
I'd fear there's nothing to believe in, nothing that would care
And the fire of desperation that's my silent prayer
That's my silent prayer, that's my silent prayer

I wanna smash the windows, the congregation's asleep
I wanna feel the wind blow and let the spirit free
I can't, I can't stand to sit there where their God is pocket-size
I wanna feel what's real and will not compromise

This rage I blaze inside me into the empty sky out there
When I feel that sorrow burning like a rescue flare
I fear there's nothing to believe in, nothing that would care
And the fire of desperation, that's my silent prayer
That's my silent prayer, that's my silent prayer

She cuts 'til she's bleeding to scream out from her skin
And he tightens the tourniquet deep within
Friends fall so fast we call it suicide
You just scream in silence over time

Oh, this pain you blaze inside you into the empty sky out there
When you feel that sorrow burning like a rescue flare
You fear there's nothing you believe in, nothing that would care
And the fire of desperation, that's your silent prayer
That's your silent prayer, that's your silent prayer

That's your silent prayer
That's your silent prayer
That's your silent prayer
",Silent Prayer
David Wilcox,"Circus-boy, run-away, steely-eyed gypsy
Seems to be adjusted to the clatter of the fair
He says: ""watch your step,"" as he tears two tickets briskly
Watches her summer legs climb the stairs
So you follow on, tip right in, latch the bar, lean to
Feel the smooth touch of summer skin
Then it all starts moving like no one else can see you
Cupid pulls the lever, and the whole thing spins
You had a shiny ride getting out of here
We never heard a word when you disappeared
Suddenly your lover just climbs right out
Steps across thin air and leaves you there
Try to catch your breath, but the bar is tight against your chest
And the ride is spinning so hard it holds you in your chair
Spin
You had a shiny ride getting out of here
We never heard a word when you disappeared
Well, that shiny ride was just lies and skin
To lead you on; pull you in
Took you for a spin
When it lets you out, you find it's many months later
Deep into winter in a small-time town
Walking kind of aimlessly, one hand on a railing
You stop a while to wait until the spinning slows down
'Cause you had a shiny ride getting out of here
We never heard a word when you disappeared
Well, that shiny ride was just lies and skin
To lead you on; pull you in
Took you for a spin
Come on and ride on a shiny new love
Don't look behind; you can step right up

Don't look behind; you can step right up

David Wilcox,"Tattered old kite
Must have been spring when you got flown
But there's no leaves in sight
Left you there to swing up there alone
Tangled in branches, and held by a string
That once let you fly in trusted breeze
Love floated me, I know the way it feels

So I walk on the ice
The river is silent as a stone
It's the same river twice
But the one that we walked into is gone
Downstream forever, or so it would seem
When the summer rain so deeply flows
Love floated me, I know the way it goes

I can't work this key
Damn thing is jammed or frozen closed
It's a strange place to be
Trying to pry my own windows
But there was a second
There was a match that was made
There was a key that is warm inside your purse
Love opened me, I know how well it works

David Wilcox,"Just one turn to steer your fate
Or wait for fate to spin you
Your trusting's fine but much too blind
Your compass is within you

These days pass you yearning
Like empty pages turning
You're holding out for something real, oh yeah

You can't play pretender
Because you still remember
Just how full your heart can feel

But how long the distance
Getting by and getting through
Your heart's strong insistence
Says that nothing else will do

But you could try on their distractions
And wear some empty compromise
But it's hard to breathe inside
Some cheap disguise

You can live your life completely
That true path, you're here to find
Or stay scared, leave your destiny behind
It's right now, here's the turning point in time

But just one thing can kill this dream
To compromise your vision
We find our truth or live some lie
It rides on this decision

Meanwhile those other voices
Hurry up and rush your choices
Try to second guess your fate, oh yeah

You can't wait forever
Gotta pull yourself together
Feel the time is running late

Well, this time right now
The turning point is here
So look deep, see clear
Soon your chance will disappear

Or you could drift into distraction
Wear that empty compromise
But it's hard to breathe inside
That cheap disguise

You can live your life completely
That true path, you're here to find
Or stay scared, leave your destiny behind
It's right now, here's the turning point in time
Here's the turning point in time
Here's the turning point in time

David Wilcox,"In the deep of the darkest night
There's a beacon of yellow light at the waffle house
At the edge of the dark abyss
When confusion descends like this
Deeper and denser at the waffle house

After the midnight hour
I am scraping the eggs and flour
From the napkin dispenser
Where we who have run from our homes
When the silence of sorrow won't leave us alone

And we who are out here this late
Be it heartbreak or highway
Or some altered state
When it's time that we slow up
Wrap both our hands around our cup

Can stay until the feeling goes
As long as there's broken hearts and dreams
And all of this highway in between
The waffle house will never close

At the waffle house
Under these cobalt skies
The drivers with bloodshot eyes, hallucinating
At the waffle house

If you're facing some bitter truth
We'll save you a window booth
And we will be waiting for you
When we you run from your home
When the silence of sorrow won't leave you alone

And you who are out here this late
Be it heartbreak or highway
Or some altered state
When it's time that you slow up
Wrap both your hands around your cup

Can stay until the feeling goes
As long as there's broken hearts and dreams
And all of this highway in between
The waffle house will never close

",Waffle House
David Wilcox,"This is where the trail just disappears
This is where their story ends
No one knows where they went from here
But I remember when they drank a toast
To the route that no one else had tried

Working up along the western ridge
Where the watershed divides
Way up there, they found their
Place in the sky

Around the fire, we told the tales
Of how they'd cut it close before
And wandered lost after the avalanche
But stumbled back to camp at dawn

But now it's much too long to hold the hope
The glacier ice can echo deep
I thought, I felt a tug along the rope
And it pulled me from my sleep

Working up along the western ridge
Where the watershed divides
Way up there, they found their
Place in the sky

The air is clear and the ice is blue
You can see from down below
That curling up over the eastern side
Is a silent plume of snow

Working up along the western ridge
Where the watershed divides
Way up there, they found their
Place in the sky

Way up there, they found their
Place in the sky
",Western Ridge
David Wilcox,"Do you believe in signs that whisper inside your mind 'till you have to follow through,
Leading you home again to someplace you've never been? Well I feel that way for you.
For how can it be true, the first time I see you,
I look into your eyes,
And suddenly I knew you all my life.

Don't we have all that time: treasure that's yours and mine, and a place that we call home
Don't we have photographs taken a long time back
Of the seasons we have known?

I know it's strange to say, when we just met this way, but I look into your eyes,
And suddenly I knew you all my life.
So I'll take the chance and tell you,
Before the chance is gone,
So at least I won't be wondering
The rest of my life long.",All My Life
David Wilcox,"Under the castle in the land of snore
Down in the dungeon where the weird are stored
All the different and the outcast sneak back home
After laughing in the bright lights all night long

I'm lucky to be down with the cast aside
Safe from the madness of the world we hide
With everybody free to come and go
Under the radar of the status quo

Down here we always got each other
Down here and it's how we know
Down here that we're sister and brother
Down here in the land below

Down here we see you looking in
Down here with your longing stare
Down here we got a feeling of belonging
(Down here)
Because we're not up there
Because we're not up there

So you want to get close to the wild and strange
You want to stand at the edge of the river of change
(No)
You got a hungry soul but a cautious mind
So you can't quite leave your world behind

So you come for a visit but you lose your nerve
Out at the edges of the bell-shaped curve
But I saw your soul when you dropped your fear
You came walking in the world of the wild down here

Down here we always got each other
Down here and it's how we know
Down here that we're sister and brother
Down here in the land below

Down here we see you looking in
Down here with your longing stare
Down here we got a feeling of belonging
(Down here)
Because we're not up there
Because we're not up there

I was only 4 maybe she was 5
We were playing in the car parked in the drive
And it all started off with the one mistake
And that was the lever of the parking brake

At the bottom of the hill we cranked it hard
Missed all the bushes in the neighbor's yard
And then picking up speed, running out of time
We drove right into our lives of crime

Down here we always got each other
Down here and it's how we know
Down here that we're sister and brother
Down here in the land below

Down here we see you looking in
Down here with your longing stare
Down here we got a feeling of belonging
(Down, down here)
Because we're not up there
(Here)
'Cause we're not up there, there

David Wilcox,"I'm tired of all the jagged edges
That cut me every time you fall
And the pieces of your life come down around you
And I'm tired of the worried voices
Crying when they call
Just 'cause I'll know where to look
When no one's found you
You're just sailing right along
That's what you're thinking
I've been bailing you out so long
You don't even know you're sinking
I'm guilty. Guilty either way

[Chorus:]
Wrong to try to fix you, and wrong to turn away
I'm guilty, guilty either way

I don't want to be the one to get that call
Some early morning
When they find you dead of more than you can take
I don't want to be the one
To dry your children's tears of mourning
And try to find some lie to cover your mistake
If I'm always here to catch you
Then you're only going to fall again
But if you fall right through the bottom
Then I'm always going to feel the blame

David Wilcox,"She wanted to move
She wanted to try something new
She wanted to live in San Francisco
In a place with a view

She wanted the sound
She wanted the life all around
She wanted the fun and the action of a livelier town
But he, he would still disagree
'Cause he loved the stillness of morning
And the wind in the trees

He needed the stars
He needed to say, ""This is ours""
And look at a field and a pasture
And a road with no cars

He wanted a farm
He wanted a horse in a barn
He wanted a life in the country, far from the town
So they, they chose to stay
They found a place where they hoped
They might both have their way

Surprise!
But that compromise was a life in the suburbs
That they both could despise
With nothing of either, too much of each
The things that they hoped for were both out of reach

No land for the garden, too far from the stores
No new folk to talk to, loud neighbors next door
Though traffic was endless, no one stepped outside
An outpost of loners who've come there to hide

Why they stayed, all those years
The answer can't be found
But there they were, there they fought
And there they stood their ground in my hometown
In my own hometown
Wonder what I've made that far
In my own hometown
In my own hometown
",Hometown
David Wilcox,"I said remember this moment
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

I said remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""this is absurd""
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped up jeans got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, ""long live the look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Can you take a moment
Promise me this:
That you'll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children someday
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you

Long, long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Singing long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
And long, long live the look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered",Leaving You/Leaving You (Reprise)
David Wilcox,"One man cruising on his ocean liner,
One trying to keep his lifeboat afloat.
One man trying to make his mansion finer,
One trying to make his house trailer note.
You give a guy a dollar in the parking lot,
And he holds his hand out for what else you've got,

[Chorus]
'Cause there's never enough.
No there's never enough.
I mean even when I've got everything I need,
I can tell myself times are tough.
No there's never enough.

See, my uncle Jon went to Reno.
He won about a hundred grand.
But he kept on trying to beat the casino,
And he played it right out of his hand.

So now he's back bettin' the ponies,
And he's trying to get back on his luck,
But there's never enough...

[Chorus]

Let's say tomorrow you win the lotto,
You got pockets so deep,
you drown all the sorrow.
You've got all the friends that money can buy,
now you're wondering if there's one you can trust.
'cause there's never enough...

[Chorus]",Never Enough
David Wilcox,"I respect what you can do
But I'd say the same about a gun
Depends which side of you they see
Some feel safe and some will run

There's so much fight you keep in store
Though in all of life, you've won your wars
And still you let yourself forget
As if it's thirty years before

Prisoner of war, prisoner of war
Though you're not held on foreign soil anymore
Bring 'em home, Jack, bring 'em home, Jack
Bring home both the mighty soldier and the boy

Something you just can't believe
The many strengths you could receive
If you could just call down your guard
Just let those forces leave

Prisoner of war, prisoner of war
Though you're not held on foreign soil anymore
Bring 'em home, Jack, bring 'em home, Jack
Bring home both the mighty soldier and the boy

And you're so strong, and that's your crutch
To keep alone and out of touch
To try to keep your heart from line of fire

So it's still trapped inside that war
Like there's a soldier at the door
It's time you told that soldier to retire
And bring 'em home

Prisoner of war, prisoner of war
Though you're not held on foreign soil anymore
Bring 'em home, Jack, bring 'em home, Jack
Bring home both the mighty soldier and the boy

David Wilcox,"I have drifted down a ways along the shoreline
I just watched these ropes give way where they were tied
I could have reached out quick
When the ropes first slipped, if I had tried

But I was wondering where the wind was trying to take me
Overnight, if I never did resist
What strange breezes make a sailor want to let it come to this
With lines untied, slipping through my fist

It is downhill all the way to the ocean
So of course the river always wants to flow
The river's been here longer
It's older and stronger and knows where to go

I guess I'm wondering where the river's trying to take me
Overnight, if I never did resist
What strange breezes make a sailor want to, let it come to this
With lines untied, slipping through my fist

This is where I played as a baby
This is where I ran as a child
This is where my dad
Took the last breath he had and smiled

I guess I'm wondering where this place is trying to take me
Overnight, if I never did resist
What strange breezes make a sailor want to, let it come to this
With lines untied, slipping through my fist
With lines untied, slipping through my fist
",Slipping Through My Fist
David Wilcox,"So you're driving from the funeral
Through the desert land
You see something moving
In the wind so wild

So you stop the car
And you walk out
To the edge of the sand
And you watch it fly

A wind blown trash bag does a road side ghost dance
In the vast Mojave sky
Like a living spirit just for one full minute
Right when you're passing by

It hovers there up in the air
Up in that twist of dust and wind
The vortex slows, so it goes
Dust to dust again

Whisper those words you heard
""Don't be afraid my friend""
It's more than just dust to dust
You're mostly a spirit wind

Mostly a spirit wind
Dust to dust
Spirit wind
Dust to dust

Is this a sign to change your mind
Tempting you to trust?
Yes, you're bound to die but you're made to fly
Just like that twist of wind and dust

This precious chance to get this dance
To get to live this life and feel
This time and place, amazing grace
The spirit wind is real

Whisper those words you heard
""Don't be afraid my friend""
It's more than just dust to dust
You're mostly a spirit wind

Mostly a spirit wind
Dust to dust

Dust to dust

Dust to dust

David Wilcox,"I know that compassion is all out of fashion
And anger is all the rage
Grow up and give in to that cynical spin
That you see on most every page

We all know what's wrong with the system
And how the people are puppets and fools
And if they're not strong it will trick them
They'll get used up like factory tools
And kids just give up in those schools, yeah

But what is it really, that's keeping me
From living a life that's true?
When the worries speak louder than wisdom
It drowns out all the answers I knew

So I'm tossed on the waves of the surface
Still, the mystery is dark and deep
With a much more frightening stillness
Underneath, underneath, oh oh

And hopelessness always comes easy
But 'easy' does not make it right
And courage can look past that surface
But fear will still put up a fight

And when I get scared and scattered
And I don't know where to begin
Why even care, it doesn't matter
Why fight when you know you can't win?
It's easier just to give in

But what is it really, that's keeping me
From living a life that's true?
When the worries speak louder than wisdom
It drowns out all the answers I knew

So I'm tossed on the waves of that surface

David Wilcox,"There's a young man dying
As he stands beside the sea
You can see him smiling
Unbelievably free

Wind in his hair, light in his eyes
He looks a lot like you, you look so surprised
But he could send you on your way
With no goodbyes

But he can't go and you can't stay
'Cause in the years it takes
To make one man wise
The young man dies

Meanwhile you're sailing
As you wave goodbye to shore
You're anticipating what these new days
Will hold in store

It's the mystery of the ocean
An' now he's in over his head
This is no place for the young man
He's got to send you on instead

Still you're looking so surprised
That this change has come as prophesised
But the years won't compromise

'Cause in the years it takes
To make one man wise
The young man
The young man dies

And he was such a lonely boy
Yeah, but he could dream, all right
He'd picture you a perfect sunrise
In the middle of your darkest night

He could take a sip from someday
Like he had a secret well
He could listen to the voices calling
That a distant time would tell

With you in that picture
Where you're looking far away
Like you hear a whisper
Of the things you'll know someday

But back then your heart was hungry
For something hard to find
Just holding out for someday
But you've left that pain behind

He walked you through those mountains
Long as he could bear
And he'd never reached this fountain
But he could take you there

To make one man wise

David Wilcox,"In the tears you gave to me 
I found a river to an ocean.
Concrete sky and a stone cold sea 
Came to where the emptiness cracked open.

Then all my fears came crashing through
And met the fire of my sorrow.
But I found my strength in forgiving you.
I never even knew how far my heart could go.

I live my life beyond each death
From the deeper well of trust.
To know that when there's nothing left
You will always have what you gave to love.

In this life the love you give 
Becomes the only lasting treasure.
So that what you lose will be what you win.
A well that echoes down too deep to measure.

A silver coin rings down that well
You can never spend too much.
A diamond echoes deeper still
You will always have what you gave to love.
You will always have what you gave to love.",Deeper Still
David Wilcox,"There's a guitar here in the window
I'd like to play before it's sold
It's such a classic, mint condition,
Great shape for one this old
Now all these axes have their stories
Of the gigs that they have seen
But, when this one sold the first time
I was seventeen

Of course, back then, I didn't want it
It was way too new for me
I needed something old and righteous
With it's own authority
So the first guitar I ever bought
Was twice as old as me
'cause it's life was filled with music
As I dreamed that mine might be
I played that thing a thousand nights
And traded it away
For something slightly newer
That was easier to play

But now lately I buy new guitars
They're shiny as a hearse
I still like the look of road-wear
But the roles have been reversed

And now this this is a classic
That I still don't need to buy
Yeah, the old ones have their stories
But by now,
So do I",Guitar Shopping

Looking at the x-ray you cried in fear
To see the bones you walked upon were shattered
A year ago you crashed on this bridge right here
But we can run back home today, you were made that way

You're stronger than ever now in the broken places
Stronger than ever now in the broken places
Stronger than ever now in the broken places
Stronger than ever now in the broken places

I found my own apartment, a broken man
'Cause I did not have the right to stand beside you
But trust grows slowly but here we stand
In the place I know is true, all my vows to you

We're stronger than ever now in the broken places
Stronger than ever now in the broken places

Like dishes in the sink
Stuff I don't believe just tumbles in
'Til I don't have room to think

All my failures are on display
The broken dreams of yesterday
The stuff I should have thrown away
But I've kept it here instead

I've gotta empty out the inside of my head

This could be a room with such a view
But it's covered up with junk
Blocking off the place the light gets through
So it keeps me in this funk

These dark clouds I've stowed away
Just in case of a sunny day
So I could stand in the pouring rain
Of every tear I've ever shed

I've gotta empty out the inside of my head

I'd like to turn this place into my home
Instead of someplace that I dread
It's the only room that's mine alone
And I'll live here till I'm dead

I'll sort through what I have found
Stuff that works I'll keep around
But I can't live weighted down
With every cruel word they said

I've gotta empty out the inside of my head

See I don't want to get there

You're on your way back down

You were one broken angel
And he was hell on your soul
So you came up for shelter
You were taking control

Now you're breaking your promise
'Cause he's got you somehow
So you're on your way back down
You're on your way back down

Ah, but I still remember
When you ran from that place
With the clothes on your back
And your hand on your face

I guess you're drawn to the fire
Until it burns to the ground
You'll be on your way back down
On your way back

Now you know my opinion
And you know I agree
That it's your life you're living

Maybe you should write this down
You wanna keep a love together
The best way is to end it now

When you both know it's over
Suddenly the truth comes out
You can talk about your secret passion
You can talk about your restless doubt

When there's no pretending
Then the truth is safe to say
Start with the ending
Get it out of the way

Now, there's no defending
Because no one has to win
Start with the ending

After you have both decided
You were missing something that you need
The ways that you were too short sighted
Get easier for you to see

After all the expectations
Shatter on the kitchen floor
You just see another human suffering
And wonder what the war was for

When there's no pretending
Then the truth is safe to say
Start with the ending
Get it out of the way

Now, there's no defending
Because no one has to win
Start with the ending

We go back a long, long time
I think about our lives together
So grateful you are here in mine

And I know you'll keep on changing
You're moving in this dance with me
I love the way we embrace the future
And keep the past a memory

So, there's no defending
That the old ways could remain
We start with the ending
And things will never be the same

So that no one has to win

And lead me down the path to where we go

Its your mouth in my ear
And you say come and I'm walking
A glide in my stride
What you whispered
Well it keeps me satisfied

Makes me high, whisper to me
Its a sound I will always keep
With me now forever
When I felt it that first time
I knew that it would change me where I stood
Change me for good

To take me through the distance
I've lived spring and I've lived fall
Now they wheel me down this hall
Beneath these lights, I'm alright
Now I feel the wind and I know where its from

Well of course there must be plenty
That you'd just as soon forget

We haven't tried this on civilians yet

But you'll have to take that risk
To get this chance at riches
And how much could it be worth
To keep those same bad dreams

Just climb up on the table
Let me throw the switches
It's really a remarkable machine
And the switch is by your head

And when it's done
You won't know how you got here
But you could write yourself a letter
Yes you'll still know how to read

Just draw yourself a map to where you're living
And put a label on each one of your keys
When your friends will try to tease you
You just won't remember

What a fool you were in high school over some old flame
Just climb up on the table, I can quench the ember
The past will never bother you again
And the switch is by your head when you're ready

Truth be told, this big machine does nothing
But there's a change that brings
A difference into all these people's lives

To free them from the past
That was their prison
What gives them passage
Is just the fact that they decide

You see this big machine is harmless
It just scares them shitless
It's louder than a spaceship
And the lights are strange

They climb up on the table and I throw the switches
And it helps them to believe that they can change
Ahh but the switch is by your head when you're ready
When you're ready, when you're ready

David Wilcox,"She couldn't sleep
She fired up the engine
'Cause she had no place to go

She likes the window open
And she's listening to the road
Just a whisper

Trust me now
I am all you've got
And you know too well
Right where you're not

So she's listening
To the whisper of the wheels

A promise held in motion
The only place she feels alright
To burn good fuel
And leave the traces in the night
Just a whisper

Trust me now
I am all you've got
And you know too well
Right where you're not

So she's listening
To the whisper of the wheels
Just a whisper

Just beyond the headlights
She can almost see it clear
As if there were a gateway
Intersecting here
Just a whisper

Trust me now
I am all you've got
And you know too well
Right where you're not

So she's listening
To the whisper of the wheels
So she's listening
To the whisper of the wheels

David Wilcox,"Look what daddy bought her for her birthday
Well, it's idling beside me at the light
And sweet sixteen is fussing in her rear view mirror
Making sure her hairdo looks alright

Well, it's my favorite form of stoplight entertainment
Watch what happens when I try to make her smile
You can tell just by the way that she accelerates
She's trying to tell me that I'm not her style

'Cause, she's got daddy's money
Daddy's money, daddy's money holds her hand
She ain't got no back bone but she's strong enough to stand
Daddy's money holds her hand

Well, then I coast up right beside her at the next light
I can't help that there's amusement on my face
Because her car must cost twenty times what mine does
Now she's got to run the light to put me in my place

'Cause, she's got daddy's money
Daddy's money, daddy's money holds her hand
She ain't got no back bone but she's strong enough to stand
Daddy's money holds her hand

Well, I really didn't mean to hurt her feelings
There's a tender heart that hides behind the wealth
Maybe if a baby gets too many shiny toys
She never finds the value in herself

'Cause, she's got daddy's money
Daddy's money, daddy's money holds her hand
She ain't got no back bone but she's strong enough to stand
Daddy's money holds her hand

David Wilcox,"We were there in the woods by the water
We left our packs up against that willow tree
We dove right in, keeping just what we were born with
Our memories, knowledge and dreams

As I swam away from our possessions
I imagined that they were gone forever more
And for once I was glad that all I treasured
Would still be with me as I reached other shore

[Chorus:]
So, let me dive into the water
Leave behind all that I've worked for
Except what I remember and believe
And when I stand on the farthest shore
I will have all I need

After the blaze burned our cabin down to ashes
Where we'd slept warm, now the sky lets in the rain
I found the strings, frets and rusted latches
But I will never hear that old guitar again
These four walls are only in my memory
Where these stone steps rise to nothing in the air
So one last look and I'm headed for the river
To wash my hands and try to say this prayer

[Chorus]

When my time to live this life is over
I'll tip my hat when I think about that swim
And of all the things that make a life worth living
That only come to those who dive right in

All I need...
Let me dive into the water

David Wilcox,"This is the story she told
 
""Can I have another quarter'"" he said.  
""What'""  
""Can I have another quarter'""  
""Why'"" she said.  
""Uh, I dropped it,"" he said.  
""Sure,"" she said, and she handed him another quarter.  
And he reached out of the window there, and dropped it in the toll basket.  
Up comes the gate, and out comes
 
Johnny's camero, Johnny's camero  
Johnny loved his camero, maybe more than life itself.  
 
Oh it was no big deal, he was just taking her to the airport.  
It was autumn in New York City,  
There was a wind a lot like this.  
It was springtime however, in Africa.  
She'd been saving up her money.  
She was going to go on one of these outward bound trips,  
So he was just giving her a ride to the airport.  
And around and around the airport they went,  
Through that parking garage, looking for a parking space.  
""There's one,"" she said.  
""No.""  
""There's one,"" she said.  
""No.""  
You see, actually it takes two parking spaces
 
For Johnny's camero, Johnny's camero  
 
He's a little nervous walking through the airport.  
He's always looking back over his shoulder.  
""You can go back if you want,"" she said.  
""No, no man, I'll stay.""  
And he did. He stayed until the plane took off.  
Then he ran back.  
But meanwhile, she was high up over the city.  
She was looking down.  
She was looking down at the lights of the buildings.  
She was looking down at the lights of the boats on the water.  
She was looking down at the lights.  
You could see them crossing the bridges,  
And through the little canyon streets.  
Little tiny, diamond toward you and ruby away.  
You know, those little tiny moving lights.  
And she knew that one of them was, well you know.  
 
Man, I've got to tell you about the adventure she had in Africa.  
I think I should start with the silver bracelet,  
I think that's where it all turns around.  
She hadn't been on the trip long and one of the guides sort of  
Took her under his wing.  
'Cause she was sort of startled easy,  
She was a little nervous about being out there.  
The first time she got sunburned through her hat  
She realized she was a long way from being home.  
She had just left the group for a little while one day,  
She had just went to take a pee,  
She said ""I'll be right back,"" but she didn't come back for awhile.  
And this guide, this African man went to look for her.  
""Laura! Laura'""  
He found her standing on the lowest branch of a fairly tall tree,  
Way off the ground.""  
""How you get up there'""  
Well she had jumped.  
""Why'""  
Well there was a hyena, and they had told her about hyenas.  
They have jaws that can crush bone.  
She wasn't in a really confident position anyway,  
And she just ran, and there was the branch.  
She jumped - one hand slipped, one hand held.  
She was not coming down.  
""He's gone.""  
So now she trusted him, and she swings back down  
And both arms straight, hanging from that branch,  
Her feet are four feet off the ground.  
Man, she didn't know she could jump that high.  
Ah, but she does now.  
 
It was changes like that that made him give her that silver bracelet.  
It was the one that he'd always wear kind of between his elbow  

And his shoulder, kind of wrapped tight around his arm.  
It was a beautiful silver bracelet, and he bent it down to fit around  
Her muscle there and she smiled.  
So much so that it startled him.  
So much so that on the last day of that trip, when they were getting  
Back on the bus to go to the small airport to go to the big airport  
To go across the ocean to go back to, you know,  
When they were getting back on the bus and she leaned out the window  
For that last little cheesecake snapshot  
And as he looked through the camera, he had to slowly take the camera  
Down, and turn his head to the side a little bit, look a little bit  
Sad and say  
""How you get up there'""  
 
She was dreaming over the ocean  
Dreaming of being home again  
Dreaming over the ocean  
Of what would never be the same.  
 
Well he wasn't at the gate when she got into the airport.  
He must have been looking for a parking space.  
So she just walked through the airport, you know,  
And it wasn't like before.  
Now the airport seemed kind of small.  
The airport seemed kind of stuffy, ceiling was a little bit low.  
And everyone was getting out of her way.  
I don't know - well, actually I do know.  
Maybe it was because it had been winter, you see,  
And she had just come back from summer.  
And she was just dressed normally. Everyone else was bundled up,  
But she had on her hiking boots and shorts and tank top,  
Hair tied back, and a knife on her belt, and a big old silver bracelet,  
I think it was the silver bracelet,  
But everybody was getting out of her way.  
She didn't see him 'til the backpack comes rolling down the  
Old baggage claim, and suddenly there's this arm  
And this voice saying, ""I'll get that.""  
And she says, ""Hey, that's my backpack, gimme it. Where you parked'""  
So he reluctantly gave her the backpack,  
And she swung it over her shoulder  
And they went out and carefully nestled it in the trunk  
 
And then, out of the parking garage and into the city.  
And she had to lean out the window,  
She pushed the button and made the window go down  
And she leaned out a little bit to feel the wind in her hair.  
Man, this is the wild place to be.  
I mean, this is the place,  
She has to lean a little further out of the car just to  
Just to see it all, just to look up at some of the buildings.  
As a matter of fact, she leaned a little farther back  
So she could look back behind  
And watch those big tires rolling on that pavement,  
And then suddenly the window came back up  
And she comes back in, startled  
And sure enough Johnny's got his finger on the power...  
The power, the power window.  
And he's looking at her like,  
""Will you get your feet off the upholstery!""  
The upholstery, the upholstery. She forgot. How could she forget'  
Well, she'd been in Africa, come on.  
She took her feet off the upholstery.  
As a matter of fact, she took her feet off the upholstery politely.  
As a matter of fact, she folded her hands in her lap  
And she settled in for this ride.  
I saw just a glint of a smile as she turned her face to one side.  
Maybe to feel the plush upholstery brush against her cheek.  
Maybe to see the lights of the graphic equalizer on the stereo  
Reflected in the side window.  
Maybe to watch that lone drop of water make its weary way across  
That perfectly waxed surface.  
But I think it was just to enjoy this ride
This ride
This last ride

Thank God we get so scared
We can't see behind this curtain
So this world seems so unfair

Look, imagine life some other way
Picture-perfect every day
Indoor weather makes this blue sky stay
So they say, ""Vacation in Eden, but bring an apple a day
Bring an apple a day""

This climb makes us stumble
Ten million ways to fall
Our childish faith will crumble
So this world will break us all

But imagine life the other way
A cozy fishbowl on display
With no chance that we might drift astray
So they say, ""Vacation in Eden, bring an apple a day

When you get there life is easy
Winning every game you play

But every day is just the same
Nothing lost and nothing gained
Same old re-run on some child-proof stage
So they say, ""Vacation in Eden, bring an apple a day
Bring an apple a day""

In the land of childish wonder
Climb the fence and run away
It's pretty to visit, but it's hell to stay

But nothing you can put your finger on
In so many ways it's going fine
You couldn't complain, you say
And day to day you get along
But lately you lie awake at night

What are you missing? Even though
You're not alone, you wake up lonely
You felt this way before, you know it's true
It's calling you to ask for more

Like a message in a bottle, 'cross the ocean
Just to wash up on your shore
From deep in your heart, please, ask for more

A beautiful dream you had reminds you of the emptiness
Something your soul is trying to say
Usually you can close your eyes and not remember this
But it's echoing back from miles away

Only a whisper, showing you something you already know
What are you missing? Even though
You're not alone, you wake up lonely
You've had this dream before
Signs are true, calling you to ask for more

Like the fragrance of the garden
That can reach you through the cracks around your door

Well, so much for forever, and the promise of a song

But that's just an old man's story
That I have never seen

And big change was ringing in their ears
It's a one cry slipping into silence
It was one voice never more to hear

The smoke of the machine

You picked them up when you were young
Maybe woven in a story
That goes back to where you're from

Truer words were never spoken
And for an audience of one
But where you're healed is where you're broken
And God knows your native tongue

So build a bridge with what's behind you
The scattered pieces of your past
Build it out over the chasm
To the promised land at last

Start a bridge with what's behind you
And God picks up where you've begun
'Cause where you look is where love finds you
And God knows your native tongue

Sounds I wouldn't understand
In a local ancient dialect

No little words can hold a candle
To the splendor of the sun
That can explain this world of wonder
And shine the same on everyone

You can feel it closer
A trace of a breeze that makes it through
I remember you said
It's almost enough that you could breath it
If you had to that's what I remember most of you

You can hear a pencil drop
And the fluorescent lights

The sun itself is in the room beside you
With a message of how good your life can be

I know that a heart can just get buried
Stone by stone, crushing hope until it dies
Far away, but the message somehow carries

Time for you to rise up

With a sudden sense of wonder
Though the promise goes unspoken
As the joy comes to your eyes
When the joy comes to your eyes
From the burden you've been under
For your soul was never broken

Beloved, it is time for you to rise, time for you to rise

There's nothing wrong with taking time for sleeping
Your eyes are weary with the things that you have seen
A deeper promise your soul is keeping
Right in time for this appointment in your dream

But follow on to where your dream may take you
To see your footsteps from an eagle's point of view

And he twists it just that way

He just loves conversation
Like a cat loves a bird

The good knights went out to save the day
In the age of the crusades
A sharp sword on a tortured soul
They were sure the point was made

Any tool can be a weapon
If it's used with that intent
The devil's great at quoting scripture
And confusing what it meant

He just loves conversation
Like a cat loves a bird
I guess he's always been a good man
In the worst sense of the word

They 'jacked a plane to make a sneak attack
They were trained to die in flames
Their last words were to God above
Just to praise His holy name

For all the terror and destruction
They felt no sense of shame
You gotta wonder why religion
Can make people so insane

He just loves conversation
Like a cat loves a bird
I guess he's always been a good man
In the worst sense of the word

",Good Man
David Wilcox,"I see the look that's in you eye
That says I must keep most of me inside
'Cause you'd never love me
If I didn't hide the secrets of my heart

Well, I'm not here for the surface stuff
I just get bored with all that fluff
So show me the edges even if it's rough
And let the real love start

You think your shame and deep disgrace
Is more than I can bear
But you could go to your darkest place
And I will meet you there

'Cause I'm strong enough to take it
And I know what you've been through
You've got a whole heart
Give me the hard part, I can love that too

You look at me with some surprise
And I see the doubt that's in your eyes
Like something deep inside you cries
With a hunger to be known

Like a tiger born in a city zoo
There's been no place for what's inside of you
You try to live like the others do
But it leaves you so alone

I know you think that the heat of your pain
Is more than I can stand
Burn it all in one big flame
And I will hold it in my hand

'Cause I'm strong enough to take it
And I know what you've been through
You've got a whole heart
Give me the hard part, I can love that too

Now your eyes well up with tears
As desire mixes with your fears
After so many wounded years
Can you long for what you've missed?

You want a cool breeze to dance with your flame
And a long-lost lover who knows your true name
And a secret garden beyond this shame
And it all comes down to this

You think your drowning hope
Will die in a sea without a shore
But I can drink that ocean dry
And still come back for more

I'm strong enough to take it
And I know what you've been through
You've got a whole heart
Give me the hard part, I can love that too

You've got a whole heart
Give me the hard part, I can love that too
Love you",The Hard Part
David Wilcox,"Say goodnight
Now the window's broken
Turn out the light
Pray they're safe from the war

Swallow the fright
Felt but never spoken
This is the terror
We learn to endure

Now the dark time comes
What is this world going though?
The children are fed, asleep in their bed
Dreaming their dream of worlds ahead

Dreaming of this world
That we are turning in
Turning into dawn
Into light, into love, into one

Lives are lost
Once more a building shatters
Count up the cost

Know it won't be the last
Fear is the boss
It's war and nothing matters
Except the children growing up fast

Now the dark time comes
Fierce is the red, white and blue
But long overdue
The peace that we knew
So sleep, little babes, your dream is true

Dreaming of this world
That we are turning in
Turning into dawn
Into light, into love, into one

",Into One
David Wilcox,"I watched it sinking down
The treasure I'd almost found
Is gone

I had been holding on
So long
I had to let it go

I wagered my heart and soul
All of that weight in gold
And dreams

The man that I thought
I should be
I had to let it go

High above the broken
Opening I see
The light of love is spoken
Welcoming me

Now that I remember
How this love can be
Full of my surrender
Emptying

Into the deep blue sky
When it's my time to fly
Away

I can release this weight
Now I can let it go
Now I can let it go

All of this love I've saved
I get to let it go

",Let It Go
David Wilcox,"A lot of cash, five hundred eighty grand
Buried in the woods
In sixteen ammo cans

Changed his pants and shirt
Washed his hands and face
He tracked that graveyard dirt
Up the concrete steps to his girlfriend's place

He knew that she was home
She faked she was asleep
She had not known him long
But she was in too deep

He stood there on her porch
She heard his cell phone ring
And with her window wide
She stayed quiet inside
And she heard everything

There's something new and exciting
In this love you've found
But there's a whole other story
Underground

She heard him laugh
He said it's dust to dust
He said he was glad
There's one man he could trust

But then he said the name
Wilford Brandon Hayes
A name that she was sure
She had heard before
In her younger days

He spoke of one more hit
She heard the where and when
Next day back at work
She called them with his plans
So on the Friday news
Two male suspects fled
They'd walked into a noose
A high-speed pursuit ended with them dead

There's something new and exciting
In this love you've found
But there's a whole other story
Underground

She took a walk
Way up on the ridge
Where she once camped out
When she was just a kid
Lost up in the woods
An old forgotten grave
And carved upon the stone
The name she knew she'd known
Wilford Brandon Hayes

So every now and then
She walks up in the woods
A little mountain air
Bound to do you good
She takes a picnic lunch
Packs enough for one
And from her secret stash
She takes a stack of cash
To have a little fun

There's something new and exciting
In this love you've found
But there's a whole other story
Underground

She kept her job
Wears a business dress
Good at what she does
Some say she's the best
She's got that corner view
Got that great big desk
She's the one he screwed
She's got attitude
She's the IRS

She saw the red flag comin'

Should have known
She's the one
The kinda girl that got a gun

She saw him coming

",Wilford Brandon Hayes
David Wilcox,"We set sail from the harbor
On the trade routes of old
Where the tall ships of spices
Bring the bright dreams of gold

There are towns full of travelers
Where the stories are told
Of the lost and the longing in the little known language
Of the wayward and bold

On our way to the crossings
We had to leave where we'd been
'Cause the roads we came over had come to an end

So we meet here as strangers, bonded as friends
We were torn from the fabric
But the threads of our lives are beginning to mend

And the hardest mile to travel
Is that first away from home
When we wonder at the hunger of being alone
But then these tears flow with laughter

With these friends we never knew
They've been waiting at the crossings
For this to come true
The world of wonder set in motion is waiting for you

There are clues in the legend and gifts in the signs
That lead to the treasure we've been searching to find
Like a map newly written of an ancient design
We have come to the crossings
Like the travelers before us, through the ages of time

And the hardest mile to travel
Is that first away from home
When we wonder at the hunger of being alone
But then these tears flow with laughter

With these friends we never knew
They've been waiting at the crossings
For this to come true
The world of wonder set in motion is waiting for you

",The Crossings
David Wilcox,"Look at all the people in their living rooms
With their eyes all glued to the evening news
Catch 'em at a moment when they're all afraid
And then sell them well on the plans you've made

All the citizens who listen and believe
Falling just the same
Falling into line 'cause we did not know
Of the bait and switch and the shadow show

When you faked the truth
To make your claims
You played our fears
For your own gain

Then we needed a leader and you're all we had
So we told ourselves you were not that bad
You took the opportunity to have your way
While our wounds still bled we were led astray

All the the fears that came descending on us then
Falling just the same
Falling like the towers in a cloud that hung
So it blocked our view and it hid the sun

When our eyes were down
In all that pain
With your  slight of hand
You cast the blame

You said that it was over when it had just begun
Saying, job well done as if the war was won
But all of us are watching as the numbers climb
Of the killed and injured, dead and dying

All the soldiers that have fallen in this war
Falling just the same
Falling for the trick that you played on us
When you made those lies and betrayed our trust

As if this war
Was just your game
You're breaking down
Our country's name

",Falling for It
David Wilcox,"The boardwalk is loud, let's hide from the crowd
Inside this booth where we pull back the shroud
Time can go fast, our summer has passed
So let's make a picture that maybe will last
We drop our quarter, down came the order

Love made a picture right here in my heart
I can see all those years shining through somehow
I see forever now

They tug at my sleeve, my friends say, don't leave
Why be alone on one more New Year's Eve
The party is fine but I don't get high
I only came here 'cause they said you'd drop by
Soon as you enter, now I remember

Love made a picture right here in my heart
I can see all those years shining through somehow
I see forever now

Some pictures develop slowly

Look what I found, the edges are brown
The picture of us in that old boardwalk town
The wear of the world, the edges have curled
But look at the smile on that boy and that girl
And there in our laughter forever after

Love made a picture right here in my heart
I can see all those years shining through somehow
I see forever now

",Forever Now
David Wilcox,"A shining drop of water rides the river to the sea
With hardly time to live at all
It tumbles down the waterfall

And crashes through the madness, dying to be free
It hits the rocks as ocean spray
And blooms again in clouds of gray, but

Some things never change

A child is born to wonder and his wonder gives him wings
To run and fly and crash and burn
He fights the empty sky and learns

That only after falling for the deepest love there is
He finds his heart is finally free
Surrendering to gravity, 'cause

Some things never change

And all the mighty empires
Have all crumbled down the same
So when the blaze burns down to dust

We can sing around the last fire
This same old refrain
About the one thing we can trust that

Some things never change

",Never Change
David Wilcox,"It will change you like a lover
When you dive below the reef
And see the phosphorescent colors
Shimmer way beyond belief

But when taken to the surface
All that color fades away
'Cause when lifted out of water
Living coral turns to gray

But down deep, it's so bright
That the light won't leave you
You've seen this sight
And they can't believe you

'Cause your words go dull
And they never could explain
There is just no telling
Where you've been

On the map it shows the mountain
But I'd never seen a glimpse
Of the hundred miles of vista
Represented by an inch

That was just a trail of bread crumbs
All their words set out so clear
But there's nothing they could tell me
That could ever take me here

To this view, this height
That the heart remembers
It's proof, it's life
It's the burning ember

My words go cold
And there's nothing to explain
There is just no telling
Where I've been

When this sunrise sees me
The first light burns brand new
Seems so easy
To tell what I've been through

But my little camera can't keep up
With panoramas all around
There's just too much view to capture
When we stand on sacred ground

Though my mind cannot explain it
My heart's filled up to the sky
I know words could not contain it
But I'm fool enough to try

Then you smile at me
And my heart is listening
Your eyes, they speak
And there's nothing missing

It's quiet up here
We can listen to the wind
'Cause there's just no telling
Where we've been

",No Telling Where
David Wilcox,"Lightning cracks the darkness
And for a moment I can see
It's just a spark to start with
But I follow where it leads

I won't spend my whole life hiding
Where no soul could ever thrive
I can't live with just surviving
My heart wants to feel alive

Life is change, and change looks frightening
Watch that wind I've been warned
But I live to feel this lightning
In this perfect storm

I see the twisting cloud that's turning
Where the earth and the heavens meet
I feel the voltage of that yearning
For the circuit to complete

So I will feel no resistance
To the current that will strike
I'll put my life across the distance
Where this longing turns to light

Life is change, and change looks frightening
Watch that wind I've been warned
But I live to feel this lightning
In this perfect storm

It washes me down to my soul
When a storm of these tears pours
It carries me into the flow
That's what it's here for

Life is change, and change looks frightening
Watch that wind I've been warned
But I live to feel this lightning
In this perfect storm

",Perfect Storm
David Wilcox,"We finally made it to the local museum
Took Uncle Lester out to see the sights
Beautiful places but we've never seen 'em
Though we've been living here all our lives
Ain't that the truth

You don't get it when you got it
You can't see it when it's in plain view
Don't ask a fish about the water
You never notice what you're right next to
When it's in plain view

I got a list of all these things that I'm fixing
I'd rather burn the place and sleep on the lawn
Our cozy home looks like a perfect picture
Only when I've been away too long
Ain't that the truth

You don't get it when you got it
You can't see it when it's in plain view
Don't ask a fish about the water
You never notice what you're right next to
When it's in plain view

Got tired of thinking and the obvious hit me
To find my fortune I'd been digging too hard
If it'd been a snake it woulda jumped up and bit me
Now I'm digging on treasure in my own back yard

They snapped some pictures from the rocket Apollo
We saw our planet like the angels do
Looks like the locals got a lot in common
But we don't see it from that point of view

You don't get it when you got it
You can't see it when it's in plain view
Don't ask a fish about the water
You never notice what you're right next to
When it's in plain view

",Plain View
David Wilcox,"All the horses out of the gate and right away
It's bio-terror coming on with smallpox
Running third is mass murder and behind him
It's airline crashing and random gunshot

I know the odds are with the fate I'm under
But now and then I can't help but wonder
Place your bets on the reaper sweepstakes

It's gonna be quick, it's gonna be fast
A ball of flame, a quick flash
An atom bomb and I'm just a cinder
Or maybe everybody freezes all of a sudden

When the weather changes into global winter
'Cause what if Yellowstone Park exploded
So much that everything was covered over
Place your bets in the reaper sweepstakes

I could slip in the shower or get mad cow disease
I could stop and smell the flowers
And stung by a swarm of killer bees

I read the paper and the headline said
Only thirteen shopping days 'till Armageddon
I got duct tape hanging at my neck because
The terrorist attack could happen any second

This could be worldwide destruction
Or alien abduction
Place your bets on the reaper sweepstakes

I tried to move away to somewhere safe
So I flew to an island but the plane got hijacked
So I decided I would fortify my home but then
I open up a letter and it's filled with anthrax

How on earth can we all avoid
Colliding with that asteroid
Place your bets on the reaper sweepstakes

I could live to a hundred and die peacefully
Of natural causes
Think how boring that would be

Out of the turn and down to the wire
It's exploding tire, poison apple and falling boulder
Out around 'em, out of nowhere and looking strong
It's the long shot growing older

I know the odds are with the fate I'm under
But now and then I can't help but wonder
Place your bets on the reaper sweepstakes

Bird flu

",Reaper Sweepstakes
David Wilcox,"It's the loneliness, it's the love you miss
It's the tears that a heart has to pay
It's the same mistakes, it's the time it takes
It's the years that lead you to say

If you'd never been broken hearted
If you never got left behind
Been a little bit crazy with the thoughts in your mind
So you had to let go of knowing

'Cause you gotta be lost and found
To land exactly where your heart was bound to find
After this long hard climb
And turns that will twist and wind
Love meets you right on time

Every turnaround, all the bridges down
That's the road that I traveled alone
Just the way it was, broken promises
What's it take to lead a heart home

If you'd never been broken hearted
If you never got left behind
Been a little bit crazy with the thoughts in your mind
So you had to let go of knowing

'Cause you gotta be lost and found
To land exactly where your heart was bound to find
After this long hard climb
And turns that will twist and wind
Love meets you right on time

Love anticipating every mile till it finds you
Love stands waiting with a smile to remind you

If you'd never been broken hearted
If you never got left behind
Been a little bit crazy with the thoughts in your mind
So you had to let go of knowing

",Right on Time
David Wilcox,"This old car, was once brand new
On the day, that you were born
But sixteen years, have rolled right through
And soon you'll drive me on your own

Sixteen years is young for you
But cars don't age so well
My door hinge speaks, repairs to do
But I've got this life of tales to tell

A tiny babe came home one day
Through the newly fallen snow
They brought you home and on the way
I knew we had some miles to go

There were Christmas trees for all those years
And they shed their trace of pine
And there's drops of milk and your young tears
Where you spilled your cup and started crying

And the grass stains here are soccer greens
And there's sand from castle beach
There's a Starburst lost from Halloween
That fell down through beneath the seats

Back and forth to every lesson
Building what you know
There was something gained for every mile
Like a seed you plant and hope may grow

Well, you had your place  in that back seat
As you grew from grade to grade
Your time back there is now complete
When you're free to drive, you've got it made

And the roads out there are to make your choice
And decide which way to steer
You'll be on your own,  I have no voice
At least not the kind  that ears can hear

You now have your longest highway
Still in you to go
Yeah, but all I need, for all I gave
Is to see you live, so take it slow

",This Old Car
David Wilcox,"All three brothers love their father and he's called them here today
To see these papers and these lawyers and divide the old estate
All three feel that they're the favorite, he loves each of them the best
And these documents he gave them will now put them to the test

So they open all the writings that will prove the rightful heir
To this home that they remember and the right to settle there
Their own sister is a prisoner, they don't see her face to face
They've not heard her song of beauty or felt the movement of her grace

She lives behind those bars of steel and waits for her release
Will she die or will we see Jerusalem in peace?

Each one looks at what he's given and he studies what he's shown
They hold their maps that show possession
Of this place they've called their home
At first they sigh with satisfaction when they see what's on their maps
Each one's given all he wanted but the boundaries overlap

Do you wish us to be brothers? Father, help us understand
Or do we each kill off the others to claim this same piece of land?
Do you mean there to be hatred in this place you built to last
And will faith just die a prisoner in the dungeon of the past

She lives behind those bars of steel and waits for her release
Will she die or will we see Jerusalem in peace?

Jerusalem is sending her voice
From inside the prison of disbelief
Stand up, you people of the one God
To bring about her release

Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed

We have grown, we have grown
Although our love is still special
Let's take a chance and fly away somewhere alone

It's been too long since we took the time
No-one's to blame, I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you darling
It's like we both are falling in love again
It'll be just like starting over, starting over

Everyday we used to make it love
Why can't we be making love nice and easy
It's time to spread our wings and fly
Don't let another day go by my love
It'll be just like starting over, starting over

Why don't we take off alone
Take a trip somewhere far, far away
We'll be together all alone again
Like we used to in the early days
Well, well, well darling

It's been too long since we took the time
No-one's to blame, I know time flies so quickly

And blame all your charms that melt in my arms

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?

S’apercevoir que les étoiles
Ne sont que des feux de Bengale,

Tomber de haut, rester sans vie,
Sans avoir l’envie d’un sursis
Parce qu’on se dit que tout, tout est fini

ti scivola sul dorso
come un riflesso
che non hai scorso

come un mattino senza sole
e che non trovo le parole 
per dirti quanto ho male al cuore

E la notte ansimante
mi si poggia sul petto
di improvviso mi sveglio 
osservando il soffitto
ed immagino il cielo 
che tu stai guardando
coi tuoi occhi bagnati 
da un velo di pianto

e il tuo calore

mi danno soldi o cibo che
divido con gli amici e poi
ci compro un pò di vino

il cuore 
farci sorridere cosi
a questa vita che ci vuole
sporchi e liberi

come con le lenzuola

mi proteggono ma
ma non è giusto

se è esco fuori
posso respirare un cielo blu

Sopra i muri lei scriveva l'emozioni che viveva

A fare l'amore sulla spiaggia
Dentro gli occhi ancora un altra volta la guardò

stiamo crescendo anche noi

Mentre scorrevi quel rosario tra le dita
la schiena curva per il peso della vita
giusto una lacrima a sollievo dei tuoi mali
attraversava il vetro spesso degli occhiali

Ma poi lasciavi la tristezza dentro te
 tornavi a sorridere
e quanta gioia nelle feste di Natale
noi tutti intorno al focolare


e resta un pò di te 
che vive dentro me

Ricorderò il tuo sorriso all'infinito

And we know too well what that's about
Still we made it through, only God knows how
We must've had a little help
(Must've been)

Wild angels, wild angels
Watching over you and me
Wild angels, wild angels
Baby what else could it be

Well it must've been hard, it must've been tough
Keeping up with crazy fools like us
'Cause it's so easy to fall apart
And we still break each other's heart sometimes
Spend some nights on the jagged side
Somehow we wake up in each other's arms
(Must've been)

Wild angels, wild angels
Watching over you and me
Wild angels, wild angels
Baby what else could it be

There are some nights
I watch you while you dream
I swear I hear the sound of beating wings",Theme from the Wild Angels
Davie Allan,"He always runs while others walk
He acts while other men just talk
He looks at this world, and wants it all
So he strikes, like thunderball

He knows the meaning of success
His needs are more, so he gives less
They call him the winner who takes all
And he strikes, like thunderball

Any woman he wants, he'll get
He will break any heart without regret

His days of asking are all gone
His fight goes on and on and on
But he thinks that the fight is worth it all
So he strikes like thunderball",Theme from Thunderball

And I must face a man who hates me

S'posin' I lose my fair-haired beauty

When I'm dippin on the grind I get my money quick
But sometimes I wanna lay up wit my honey dip
She be wit me cause she aint like all them other chicks
Let you hit, then she split, that's why I got a honey dip
From the club to the telly you know how it is
Most of the chicks I never tell em where a nigga live
Tryna reach me at my mansion or my mother crib
Hit my cell, hit my two, now I'm at my honey dips

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
Yo we talked about 8, said I was comin thru to hit
Now its wee hours in the mornin and I'm drunker than a bitch
Stumblin and shit, I jumped up in the whip
Flipped open the horn like where's my honey dip
And bitch fuck ya man tonite, you know my steelo
Sizzurp wit the Cristal, the corners playin cee-lo
You see me well you jus smile you know we on the le-low
I'm whippin thru the town like we boilin up a kilo
Huh, I'm tryna dip up in the tele
Dip up in the room, then dip up in her belly
Dip off on Pirelli's, Dip-Sets Fonzarelli
My white t-shirt, lookin dip up in my Pelle
Smokin weed up in the Range
Full speed left lane
Its me against the world, M.O.B. up in my vein
Wit another nigga girl, gettin low to give me brain
If the bitch about the cause you aint gotta spit no game

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Jr Writer]
You know I'm lookin for a honey dip
But I'm no dummy, most these bunnies
are money hungry and lookin for a money clip
So after the brother hit
I'll tell a honey dip
She won't see a contact, address nor buddy list
I aint on some hubby shit
That lovey dovey shit its nuttin trick I'm suttin slick you couldn't get
enough of it
How a slugger jus slide up thru the check in
Wit that linin on the Wesson
Hundred diamonds on my neck and wrist shit
I'm rich bitch, rhymings my profession
Watch how I do this stupid grindin and perfectin
Who's flyer when I step in got em spyin every second, cause that 06
Charger remind em of a 7
Yes man I'm so fresh the pro mess wit bread honey
My jeans 800, these are called Red Munkey
The flossin is gone, come talk to a Don fly enough to belong on a
catwalk in Mulan.....holla

[Verse 3: Juelz Santana]
I got me a lovely chick, I got me a slutty chick, I got em all, but my
favorite one is my honey dip
She get drunk wit me, roll the piff up wit me
Throw singles at other hoes in the strip club wit me
She do anything for jus one quicky
She a nympho chick
For this slow dick
She give no lip, she jus go get
The paper I ask her for, my bitch so quick
Plus she know every Santana song and she don't mind puttin the damn bandana on
Slap her ass tell her dance in this thong
She do it all for daddy
She move it all for daddy...Aye Aye
She get a brick and she boof it all for daddy
Hit the road shake the State Troopers off for daddy
And she bring all that paper back
No short paper back, she sure don't play wit that

I never lose control like that
I'm happy as I am
I'd never give my soul like that
Because in time I've learned,
It never is returned

Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

Davy Jones,"I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else but not for me
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all of my dreams

Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
I'm in love, and I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried
No not if I tried

I thought love was more or less a giving thing
Seems the more I gave the less I got
What's the use in tryin'
All you get is pain
When I needed sunshine I got rain

Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
I'm in love and I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried
Not if I tried

Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all of my dreams
What's the use of trying
All you get is pain
When I wanted sunshine I got rain

Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
I'm in love and I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried
No not if I tried
Not if I tried, no

Davy Jones,"Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
I won't make it any other way
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now

Davy Jones,"We were speaking of belief
Beliefs and conditioning
All belief possibly could be said to be the result of some conditioning
Thus the study of history is simply the study of one system of beliefs
Deposing another and so on and so on and so on
A psychologically tested belief of our time is that the central nervous
System, which feeds it's impulses directly to the brain, is unable to
Discern between the real and the vividly imagined experience,
If there is a difference, and most of us believe there is
Am I being clear?
To examine these concepts requires tremendous energy and discipline
To experience the now without preconception or belief
To allow the unknown to occur and to occur requires clarity
For where there is clarity, there is no choice
And where there is choice, there is misery
But then why should anyone listen to me?
Why should I speak since I know nothing?",You and I (And Promises Not Broken)
Davy Mooney,"Once I was young
Yesterday, perhaps
Danced with Jim and Paul
And kissed some other chaps

Once I was young
But never was naive
I thought I had a trick or two
Up my imaginary sleeve
And now I know I was naive

I didn't know what time it was
Then I met you
Oh, what a lovely time it was
How sublime it was too

I didn't know what day it was
You held my hand
Warm like the month of May it was
And I'll say it was grand

Grand to be alive, to be young
To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch
Hear your voice say, ""I'm all your own""

I didn't know what year it was
Life was no prize
I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes
I'm wise and I know what time it is now

To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch

Que tu es venu sans faire de bruit

Et même déposé mes armes
Prêt à me rendre à l'évidence
Mais au-delà de toutes mes espérances

Au fond, je ne t'espérais plus
Et pensais bien être perdu.

De m'aider à reprendre mes esprits
Le vrai et unique chemin,

Davy Spillane,"There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more

Dawn,"Oh, the good life, full of fun, 
Seems to be the ideal
Yes, the good life let's you hide 
All the sadness you feel.

You won't really fall in love, 
For you can't take the chance
So be honest with yourself, 
Don't try to fake romance.

It's the good life 
To be free and explore the unknown,
Like the heartaches 
When you learn you must face them alone.

Please remember, I still love you, 
And in case you don't know,
Well, just wake up,

Love
What does it mean
To live between
The beginning and ending of love
Where do you go
To get to know
The reason why a brand new feeling
Comes to take you
Away from reason

Love
How do you know
The things you do
You do not only from need
And not from greed
But only from love

When do you get to be
Someone who can give
And live without hurting
Someone you love
Why do we grow
And never show
The little that we know love

I don’t wanna lose the frequency
I don’t wanna let the feeling leave

Rise away to hit the landing
Get the sounds of the space and
I don’t wanna lose my frequency
I don’t wanna let the feeling leave

Turn me on for sonic love
I want you to hear the way you make me feel
When you turn me on
Take it high, till you get it right 
I can feel it build, frequency is real
When you turn me on

Vibrations set the tone
Stimulation makes it flow
Your signals find a hard room
Send a message, make it known

Face the beast with my bare hands
Tried to break me down with all his strength
But I got luck and this somewhat chance
And I saw that need for me to beat the bad

Each win I conquer I look to my father
I ask him for favor to take down this monster
All for the honor, it gave me the power
To do like no other, to say I have conquered

With his best friend and moved down to Mexico

On her way to work religiously
She looked me in my eyes and said to me
She's barely able to make ends meet

It broke my heart to have to hear her say
She had three children and one on the way
For her kids she had to be strong
'Cause things got rough when their daddy moved on

To proud to ask her family to help her
Cause her father always swore she'd be a failure
If it wasn't for her children's love
She would have given up

Ford and his lizzie
Kept the laughers busy
That's how people are
They laughed at me wanting you
Said it would be, ""hello, goodbye.""
But oh, you came through
Now they're eating humble pie

They all said we'd never get together
Darling, let's take a bow

Hee, hee, hee!

Ha, ha, ha!

It's no good unless he loves you, all the way
Happy to be near you 
When you need someone to cheer you, all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue see is
That's how deep it goes, if its real

It's no good unless he needs you, all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in between years, come what may

It's for sure I'm gonna love you, all the way

I feel pretty and witty and bright
And I pity any girl who isn't me tonight

And so pretty that I hardly believe I'm real

Who can that attractive girl be?
Such a pretty face, such a pretty dress
Such a pretty smile, such a pretty me

I feel stunning and entrancing
Feel like running and dancing for joy
For I'm loved by a pretty wonderful boy

I feel pretty, oh so pretty

A committee should be organized to honor me

I feel fizzy and funny and fine

Such a pretty smile, such a pretty me

Dawn Upshaw,"My ship has sails that are made of silk
The decks are trimmed with gold
And of jam and spice there's a paradise in the hold

My ship's aglow with a million pearls
And rubies fill each bin
The sun sits high in a sapphire sky when my ship comes in

I can wait the years
Till it appears
One fine day one spring
But the pearls and such
They won't mean much if there's missing just one thing

I do not care if that day arrives
That dream need never be
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring
My own true love to me
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring my own true love to me","My Ship, song for voice & piano (from ""Lady in the Dark"")"

Prince's and heroes in the world

We can see, we can see

There won't be trumpets or bolts of fire

No Roman candles, no angels choir
No sound of distant drumming

He may not be the Cavalcade

Doesn't matters just as long as
He comes on home

But not with trumpets or lightning flashing
Or shining armor
It maybe daring, he maybe dashing
Or maybe he's a farmer

We can wait, watch another day
He has lots of hills to climb
And the hero doesn't come
Till the nick of time

That guarantee him
There won't be trumpets, but sure as shooting

Dawn Upshaw,"Once I hated this city
Now it can't get me down
Slushy, humid and gritty
What a pretty town

What thought I could be duller
More depressing, less gay
Now my favorite color
Is gray

A wall of rain as it turns to sleep
The lack of sun on a one-way street
I love the grime all the time
And what more do I need?

My window pane has a lovely view
An inch of sky and a fly or two
Why I can see half a tree
And what more do I need?

The dusk is thick and it's galling
It simply can't be excused
In winter even the falling snow looks
Used

My window pane may not give much light
But I see you, so the view is bright
If I can love you, I'll pay the dirt no heed
With your love what more do I need?

Someone shouting for quiet
Someone starting a brawl
Down the block there's a riot
And I'll buy it all

Listen now, I'm ecstatic
Hold me close and be still
Hear the lovely pneumatic
Drill

A subway train thunders through the Bronx
A taxi horn on the corner honks
But I adore every roar
And what more do I need?

I hear a crane making street repairs
A two ton child running wild upstairs
Steam pipes bang, sirens clang
And what more do I need?

The neighbors yell in the summer
The landlord yells in the fall
So loud I can't hear the plumber
Pound the wall

An aeroplane roars across the bay
But I can hear you as clear as day
You said you loved me

My breast an empty shell,

Guided by just a lonely heart!

Not a cent in the red

As Kate the Great
Used to state long ago

With a giddy trot
I’m a trottin’ because I’ve got
Not a bean in my pot

Hole in my shoe, my belt’s drawn tight
My income is nil, my in-laws are weasels
My present is dark, my future’s a fright
But as long as you are there
What in the world do I care?

Though I can’t jive
I revive when I see your face
Not a limp in my merry pace
Not a crimp in my style
Not a care in the world

Though I’m a wreck
I can peck if you take a chance
Not a shine on my blue serge pants
Not a crack in my smile
Not a care in the world

Why should I fret
When I bet on a sure thing?
Like Nick the Greek
Used to say every day
""Yip-i-ay""

So if I’m struttin’
With nuttin’ ahead in store
There’s a reason I said before
I’ll repeat it once more

Not a crimp in my style
Not a crack in my smile
Not a care in the world

But this is the nearest to being alive
Let me take my chances on the wall of death

You can go with the crazy people in the crooked house
You can fly away on the rocket or spin in the mouse
The tunnel of love might amuse you
And noah's ark might confuse you but
Let me take my chances on the wall of death

On the wall of death

I found a new place to dwell
It's down at the end of lonely street
At heartbreak hotel

And I get so lonely baby

I get so lonely baby, I could die

Oh, though it's always crowded
You still can find some room
For broken hearted lovers
To cry there in their gloom

A bleeding telephone
Razorblade cuts on both arms
911 may be the way out

Hey yeah!
Anybody hear now?
Anyone at all?
Anybody hear now?
Have you come and gone?

With both heart strings torn
Looking for true love and more
Any day may be the day of
Bruised and battered bones
A broken heart
An open sore
911 may be the way out

Hear me when I scream! 
Where is love?
Overtaking me!
Where is love?
Screaming out of me!
Where is love?

Day of Fire,"Reborn, a birth that comes through water
The fallen of the garden is drowning in the water
The water, the water

I wait for you to carry me

Wake to the work in the fields, harvest has come
The sun is setting on the hill, day is soon done

Newborn through brokenness and calling
On hand and knees we're crawling
The Father?s voice is calling you

Wake to the work in the fields, harvest has come
The sun is setting on the hill, day is soon done
The servants at work by the will of He who returns
Wake to the work in the fields, harvest has come

I wait for you to carry me, two by two
I wait for you to carry me

Wake to the work in the fields, harvest has come
The sun is setting on the hill, day is soon done
The servants at work by the will of He who returns
Wake to the work in the fields, harvest has come

Day of Fire,"Don't you ever forget, don't you ever believe in the lie
You could never redeem any time, looking back in regret
Don't you ever forget

Did you see it coming? Was it more than you could bet?
Did you fall for something? Were you taking your next step?
Was it all for nothing? Just to find yourself in debt
To the thought of something that you could have never kept
You could have never kept

Don't you ever forget, don't you ever believe in the lie
You could never redeem any time, looking back in regret
Don't you ever forget, don't you ever believe in the lie
You could never redeem any time, looking back in regret
Don't you ever forget

Could you keep it coming? Did you stop and catch your breath?
Would you walk on water or just sink inside your head?
Could you stand for something even if you stand against?
Would you hold on to it if it's broken in your hands?
Broken in your hands

Don't you ever forget, don't you ever believe in the lie
You could never redeem any time, looking back in regret
Don't you ever forget, don't you ever believe in the lie
You could never redeem any time, looking back in regret
Don't you ever forget

Sometimes you just don't know, just how to let it go
Sometimes you just don't know

Don't you ever forget, don't you ever believe in the lie
You could never redeem any time, looking back in regret
Don't you ever forget, don't you ever believe in the lie
You could never redeem any time, looking back in regret

Don't you ever forget, don't you ever believe in the lie
You could never redeem any time, looking back in regret

Miles of silent conversations, searching through the
Stations, we sink into the road

Down this long highway we'll find a way
On this long highway to say the things that we've been so
Afraid to say
We'll find our way through lies and pain, it'll be okay.

Headlights shine on the street signs. Watch them passing

By reflections in your eyes
Hearts broken by the distance, love turned to resistance
Leaves me so alone
We just drive when it's not okay. We just drive

Their eyes met across the queue,
Look at you.

He asked for her current address,
She blushed and said how her hair was a mess.
He said ""I'd really like,
To go out with you"".
He said ""we'll wait, 'til ??? day,
And that way, the queen can pay.
So I'll pick you up tomorrow"".

She answered wearing slippers,
Said she couldn't find a baby-sitter.
He said ""I'm going nowhere without you.""
So she took her kids to her mom's for the night,
And they went and the birght lights,
In the town, mad them feel, like a million pounds.

They went out for a romantic dinner,
Then went to to see a real blues singer.
She said ""I really like, being with you"".
And when they came to the end of the night,
He asked her hard again in a fortnight.
She said ""I'll see your before, in the line,
When we sign"".

So two weeks later she's looking for him,
But he's not in the queue amongst all the men.
She's looking frantically, but no luck.
She walks up to his friend,
And asks him why he isn't signing ???
He shakes his head, she says ""what's wrong?""
He said ""they took him away, yesterday"".
He said ""you see my darling, they did a search,
Turns out he's ??? in building work.""

Down in an old leather jacket
She walked her rhythm in designer shoes expensive,
Her style got it (bother ? ) quite overdressed
And then it happened, looking at each other imagine us as lovers
Don't ask said words, we only sat and sight
It felt right so stepped to her and said to her :

""leave with me and compete with me
Leave with me and complete with me""

As they walked there was a silence between them
And silence is that counts for words
She looked into his eyes, romanticised his whole life
He had that look that he was foreign
Get up and smoke and spoke his words like a ballon
He was unshaven, (haired are craven ? )
For danger of a stranger, looked like he had it in his nature
And she said : ""what are you thinking
What are you thinking about ?
What are you thinking, what are you thinking about ?

Is that talking is the expression of thought
And thought is the unexpressed idea

It's never really what it seems 
Cause first we were chillin
Now I'm catchin feelins 
Can you tell me what this means
I'm going through my voicemail 
And I'm saving every message you sent 
I'm tryna reading between the lines 
To see if there was somethin' I missed

So pressed to let you know 
Just how you make me feel 
Never had a feeling that's so real 
Control me (and I'm ready, girl I'm ready)

Don't wanna play no games, 
I want you exclusive, 
Baby, we should just do this, 
With the feeling's so strong, 
How can we go wrong 
No games, I want you exclusive 
There's no more excuses 
The feelings so right 
I want you girl, I need you girl

I really love your company, 
Hate it when you gotta leave 
Another oppurtunity, 
For me to say everything.

When you look at me like that (like that).

But I don't know how your gonna react.

Everything I needed was right here, 
Before me (before me) 
So pressed to let you know 
Just how you make me feel 
Never had a feeling that's so real 
Control me (and I'm ready, girl I'm ready) 

[Chorus]
Don't wanna play no games, 
I want you exclusive (exclusive) 
Baby, we should just do this (baby lets do this) 
With the feeling's so strong (so strong) 
How can we go on (Go on) 
No games, I want you exclusive 
There's nomore excuses (no more excuses) (ohh baby) 
The feelings so right (So right) 
I want you girl, I need you girl 

[Chorus]
Don't wanna play no games 
I want you exclusive (exclusive) 
Baby, we should just do this (baby lets do this) 
With the feeling's so strong (so strong) 
How can we go on? (how can we go on) 
No games, I want you exclusive (ohh yea) 
There's no more excuses 
The feelings so right (ohhh) 
I want you girl, I need you girl

Well I'm gonna take my time
And I, ain't gonna rush into something
To get left with nothing again

Would you live for me
Now shawty tell me would you die for me (die for me)
Are we in this together (come and tell me)

Would you hold it down for me

Are we in this together
Are we in this together
Tell me

If bein' in love with you was such a drive
And I needed a place to hide
And there's no time, and I needed to get away driver
Could you find it inside of your heart
Cause I do the same for you
There ain't no tellin' what love can do
If it's true, you got my heart wide open
That's why I'm hopin'...

Would you live for me

To never even give a little piece of me.

You think we've been here before
I say I'm sorry, you come back
I do it again
And then you back
But girl it's different now
See every time we had it out
You would go to the door
I chase behind you
When I talk you're back right to the floor
You say that you needed time
Could you get back to me
And let me know how long you need
'Cause I can't take it no more

Any place that you want to explore I'm coming.
I'm assuming that you already know what pleases me.

I think I'm 'bout to lose it.
Just watching you move it real slow.
Don't let it go.

No need to speed up the pace.
I can replace the past you had.
And redefine what passion is.

You know I can't wait anymore.

Then there's you (rescuing me)
And when the world starts crumbling (crumbling)
Then there's you.
If I got nothing else, there's always you.

After I been working hard
You cater to my needs unselfishly
And in this crazy world you are my sanity

I'm soon to be a gun holder Initiate to the clique 
With a left to my lip now the fight's over",Initiated
Daz Dillinger,"Ah shit! 

Yeah 
Everywhere I go 
'Nough gunshot are firin' out the ghetto area seen? 
I hava watch my back 
Too much crack seen? 
Watch yourself 'cause 'nough homicide a gwan in de area 

I hear some niggas clockin' major on the other side of town 
Strictly slidin' for a proper come up to come around 
Called up the homies from way back, who dream of gettin' paid 
Then finally get paid with the amount of 80 G's 
6:30 layin' in cut, prepare to get ready 
Me and Ty grew up, mashin' to get our feddi 
Food stamps galore, kick in the door get on the floor 
Make sure my homies get away smooth with the dough 
A hardcore motherfucker raised up not knowin' 
Now my dream is just a dream we're sellin' dope and hoein'
Moms can't tell me shit, I make the rules that I live by 
In and out the house, late at night, and plus I got high 
The homies influenced me to be the G of all G's 
Perfectly innovated to all my homies 
Pull out the Riviera, plus I kick up dust 
Pull out the brain, pull out the thing, cock back and bust 
It's just some gangsta shit, goin down on the Eastside 
Some niggas who died and tried to who ride on mine 
Pull on the 7 Carter with the homey Flossy Floss 
He's the homey from the Beach who's known for takin off 
Pile up the bird then swerve, conversate on smoke and submerge 
Finger on the trigger, contemplatin' on a murder 
I mean, takin life 'for life, cause it's right 
Shit, niggas gotta do, to earn they stripes, straight merkin'

[Chorus: x2]
It's some gangsta shit, that's going down 
Homicide, straight murder/homicide 
It's some gangsta shit, here in this town 
Straight murder

Word on the street is that them D-P-G niggas shot they homeboy 
Now the only sound in the town is gunfire 
Going down I sport the crown I give it up on motherfuckers 
When I roll through I thought you knew about them Doggs in blue 
Now forty-five, niggas bought em by the spot 
I'm on alert I'm down to work every nigga that I shot 
Niggas skied out quick, around the block who know we comin' back 
Post up early on the attack 
Slowly but surely spot an enemy slippin out his domain 
Rode up on him and let him see the twelve gauge 
The homey Ty banged him on GP because we stuffed him then we bagged him 
Cause he violated the rule of the streets 
Two redrums under my belt, it felt good bout to murder 
Haven't you ever heard of a murderer motherfucker? 
Cause I'm, a straight gangsta, doin' what I feel 
Niggas no need to tempt, for me to kill, straight blastin'
The enemy, can't see the hoes who try to get with me 
Understand where I'm comin' from the D-P to the G-the-see 
The niggas who trip, niggas that dipped 
Niggas that conversate with the Bloods or Crips 
It's just a West coast thang, gangsta thing 
Niggas come around here but surely can't hang because-a 
We don't hang with no bustas and sho' nuff 
Don't hang with no fags and niggas down to blast, straight merkin 

[Chorus]

Check it out 
I heard niggas kickin' static makin' noise 
Cold hearted want to get it started with my boys 
Automatic toys to tangle with niggas for profit 
Got shit on lock down cause I lets the Glock spit 
Soon as D-A-Z hits me on my hip, talk about chips 
The game run heatin' them clips, the gaze kicks 
Automatic tech nine spits, I gotta 
Roll with the Pound that's the neighborhood of murder 
Am I the only motherfucker ridin'? 
Am I the only rider but I found a whole pound of niggas violent 
I got the big homey Ty money worldwide 
From Portland, Oregon L.A. to the N.Y. 
I'm bout to crash in your door, unload the double four 
Then stash it, then we blasted all we saw 
The fo'-fo', the fo' double sparkin'
The gang walkin' up your hood like nothin' but trouble 
We straight gangsta shit 

[Prince Ital] 
That's right 
We dat live by de knife will die by de knife 
You betta try save your life 
On your life dere might be a oversight 
Take my ad-vice and jump in a your ride 
Don't are-gue with de Death Row pride

We got keep every stone you keep 
In your life, you betta don't feel strife 
We dat live by de knife will die by de knife

Oh lawd, oh lawd

[Featuring Nate Dogg  Snoop Doggy Dogg] 
Snoop (Daz): 
Yeah  what I'ma do right here is take my time  
and dedicating this one to my niggas resting in peace  
and my niggas behind the wall. 
See you when I get there  you know what I'm saying? (really doe) 
So drip with me as I go down memory lane. 
Boy it's a loony where the grass is greener  
(1 8 7 ain't shit but a misdemeanor). 
I've seen a lot of niggas come up, but few niggas done up, 
some rest in peace, with their khakis heavy squeezed. 
But it's a East Side thang, a hoo ride thang, 
('cause if we bang to the boogie than we boogie to the bang). 
I bring you the motherfucking .38, 
(just get the MC and the homie Nate). 
So we can slide, slide, slipperdy slide, 
as I take you on a trip nigga ride (East Side). 
Nate (Daz): 
Do you remember back on the East Side? 
Where all us niggas used to love to ride. 
We didn't care what we did, 
time was nothing to us we were just kids. 
Times are different now, but you still get stuck, 
I'm not a kid no more, I just don't give a fuck. 
So if you're thinking about coming and stepping to me, 
keep this in mind: I'm a motherfucking O.G. 
Snoop: 
Lets speed the clock up and pass some time, 
June 17th, 1979. 
That's my first time being arrested, 
I know I did the crime, but I ain't going to confess to this shit. 
I learned than from the G's, 
a G is an overseer, the overseer sees. 
More than you do 'cause he gets experienced, 
and besides I'm just a juvenile delinquent. 
So I was gone, and I'm on my way home, 
my momma's going to get me, and I flee with (???). 
She puts a jacket on my back and hands me a comb, 
We stop and frosty freeze for a couple snowcones. 
She telling me that I didn't need to do what I done, 
she said: ""playing football should be your only fun son"". 
I'm like ""allright"" so we enter the house, 
come up to the door and pops fired to the mouth. 
I couldn't do nothing but cry like a bitch, 
I looked at my momma and said: ""damn, why you snitch?"" 
They put me on punishment but that didn't work, 
now wearing khakis, wallabees, and a T-shirt. 
And throwing up the neighborhood gang sides, 
I do my first robbery and now I gotta do time. 
Nate: 
My homie told me one day he had a jack move, 
he said: ""come on Nate Dogg, it'll be smooth"". 
I agreed and said ""come on, let's go and jack them fools"", 
next day we were draped in the county blues. 
I went and did a little time in the bucket see (seventeen years), 
saying to myself ""I'll never fuck with that nigga again"". 
'fore I'm locked down I learned to be 
what I am now and that's a motherfucking O.G. 
Original gangsta 
Daz: 
I grew up in the city as a chap, faced the trials, 
never smiled, became a gangster in the meanwhile. 
You'd find me swearing and lying, trying to be an O.G., 
beating the shit out of niggas for guess, some Hillfigers. 
The man behind the trigger, committing robberies, 
with the homies, no one could stop, nobody knew me. 
Breaking niggas for showing, sucker niggas better know me, 
because we ain't letting the bullshit slide no more. 
Do your wear nigga and kick in your front door, 
to let you know we can't take no more. 
Feeling revenge, killing enemies, family and friends, 
and let you pay the cost for my homie's life, it's lost. 
Toss a coin in the air, run my fingers through my hair, 
and ask myself: ""who the fuck should I really fear?"". 
I ran around with the best killers, 
thug criminals and drug dealers. 
Blasting niggas if they come near us, 
(???) with evil spirits, no one could help us if we could. 
Knock on wood for good luck, 
serve every nigga in your hood with a buck, now you've been struck. 
Stood gangsta in a static gangsta mack, 
a grown child laying niggas the fuck down. 
Nate (Daz): 
Original gangsta (original gangsta), 
coming from Long Beach (the town by the sea where niggas know me). 
Coming from the East Side... 
You're fucking with The Pound, oh nigga please, 
see-O-B.'s can't see the D-O-double G's, [O.G.'s... repeat 5 times] 
shout outs to my nigga Mr. D-A-Z, 
shout outs to my nigga Mr. Warren G, 
shout outs to my nigga S-N-double O-P, 
shout outs to my niggas see, Style and me. 
Snoop (Nate): 
Yeah, straight up, based on a true story. 
you know what I'm saying? It's a G thang baby (original gangsta) 
You trick ass bitch! 

",O.G.
Daz Dillinger,"Oh no! murder, murder, murder
Busting at these niggas who claim to be hard
Murder, murder, murder

Come and blast dat nigga daz and act rude
Coming through, murdering fools who claim to be hard
Pulling your motherfucker's cords
Me, we're going back for you to say that
Prepare for battle, load the narrator with pay back
Knowing where you motherfuckers rest and hang at
I'm in long beach, where the gang bangers hang at
Don't want more static, or panic, we're packing gats
And asking for shit, nigga, 'cause we're blasting
See, we're the gang, kicking just to maintain
Bang on niggas for a living, busting upon the selling corners
We on 'em just for twelve figures
Money, dope, cars and bitches, to getting richer

[Chorus: x2]
Oh no, niggas just wanna get killed tonight
Tripping on you, the way I feel tonight
Niggas better pack you guns

Glocks are popping off like turbo
Step into my circle, my word is out to serve yo shit
Money busters lyrically in motion
About to whip a ? the east side coast and
I'm the one they love to hate with a passion
I packs a blue steel, filled with skilled raps, blast it
Mc's get dealt with, my microphone's my third partner
Heat seeking like a missile when I drop ya
Style is proper, my execution-style of rapping
I'm packing a rap while you say ""why, what's happening? ""
My mind is going deep, like money mister, doing all
You couldn't see me with a crystal ball, y'all
It's critical, I'm thinking of a master plan
Come out with your shit man, I'm broke, feeling critical conditions
Listen, money on a dirt mission
Creeping to the night, beating tight, Armageddon

[Chorus: x2]

Watch out, here I come
Battling motherfuckers till the break of dawn
Homeboy, ring the alarm
It's d-a to the z, dropping the formula
And every nigga that I know in californ-I-a
Dat nigga daz will come out and play
Busting on niggas with an ak
So any given day you want some
Come and get some, you don't want none

Why do we bang?
Why do we bang for a living? we just don't know
Now it's time to serve y'all bitches ass niggas on an open platter
Yeah, ha ha

Fool, what nigga, you know that got your ass laying down?

You see, I take the ultimatum, disregard the outcome
I'm hard to outrun, and won't be outdone
I hate fake take away motherfuckers
I come up from the slums and I run, motherfuckers
No other than the gang, it's the slang and prosper
And bang us mobsters, while claiming oscars
While most niggas froze, they control their coast
They be home and broke, 'cause they've been known to choke
Like Malone, be gone when the playoffs come
But I'm a stay off one, liable to spray off some
Ammunition, I handle missions one on one
Niggas, come on, come and get their ? done
I'm the cannibal, the Hannibal lector of rap
A nigga steps up wack, and gets a setup-tax
We're the gang, and we're mashing, blast to maintain
We're the kings in the game, and things ain't to change

[Chorus: x2]

Oh no",Oh No
Daz Dillinger,"(Feels so good)
Feels good to know that someone loves you
(To know someone loves you)
Feels good to know someone cares
(I want to feel you)
It's been a long time since I felt you
Just call my name I'll be there
(Feels so good)


Young Daz rollin' through high suburban, swervin'
Down the block, catchin' eyes and cutie pies
Observe, that is somethin' particular, met 'em ??? town
Home girl what's ya name, she replied the same
Yo baby lookin' fly, I could see it in her eye
Respect me, you best be prepared when you sex me
Since I let you tell it girl I could rock you 'til your heart stops
Down to your knees like just like havin' a seizure
Please you with the conversation ?? ???
Later on, have you chillin' talkin' 'bout livin' lavish and bubble bathes
Kickin' it on the Ave, young Daz trippin' off the times we had
Wasn't usual but it was crucial, that I had the bomb and you had it
Couldn't even get mad, it wasn't expected from the baddest girl around town
I paged you early in the day, by 10:30 have it all locked down
What you did to me couldn't be duplicated, you made it the bomb
Even playa hated sometimes, keep in mind
When you laid your head, you knew you laid it in the right place
When you gave it up girl, you knew you ran the right race
Make it hot and sweet, give your body to me
Young Daz, sho' 'nuff gon' get it, home girl
And it feels good baby

In my mind's eye all I see is time passin' by
Will I make it to the other side
Ready to ride, we was all born to die
But will I die alone, baby girl what's it gon' be
She got the bombest shape I ever seen before
Man, she got a brother thinkin' 'bout never doin' wrong, man
 
Go on girl with your bad ass
She got her own bank account, makin' her own cash
I might be movin' to fast, but with an ass shaped like that
She's the shit, plus she makes her own money, she ain't after my chips
I mean what more could I ask for, what else would I blast for
Catch a G dippin' by high at the sky, I lace the game
Everybody wants the best, and every gangsta has a gangstaress
When I pulled on the block lovin' the hood like a muthafucka 
Then I seen my girl, felt good from that moment on

Yo Daz (get busy)
Kurupt (get busy)
All my ladies (get busy)
It don't stop (get busy)
Ay yo Daz (get busy)
Kurupt (get busy)
It don't stop why'all (get busy)
It don't stop why'all (get busy)

Who ya down for (you)
To ride or die, to lie, baby just for you)
Wouldn't trade you for no money or no girls
It was me and you to rule the world 
(it was me and you to rule the world)
She cruise my neighborhood draggin' the ground
Layin' it down on hundred spokes
Flossin' with her home girls with no shirt
Pull around the corner, Dana Dane's shinin'
She see me on the grind and on the front line and
You know where I hang, about handlin' things
Be on the corner where the bangers bang
Flossin' the neighborhood with your home girls yellin' 'whoo, whoo'

Lookin' extra cute, G'd in my Coupe
Get your bounce on baby girl, I love her
Plus you'll bounce with me, I adore her
'Cause she'll blaze an ounce with me (say what)
Khakis more creased than mine
She's gangstafied, she wears Dickies not Calvin Kleins
Never ignore me 'cause she adores me, ya know, ya know",Feels Good

Undercover in a bucket like fuck it
What them real niggas got to say to them bitch niggas boy?
This gangsta shit
And I'm a be the first runnin' up, blastin' with the gun tucked
Blastin' the suckas 'til niggas get chipped
I'm a fanatic, somatic, 24-sev fool
Dippin' in a Cutlass, two P's in a bucket

It ain't nothin' but a gangsta party motherfucker!

Work that thang girl, pop that azz
You are now cultivated by the sounds of Daz
And, all my gangsta niggas keep on smashin' on these bitches
And we hittin', hittin' switches on three in a 'Llac
If you're lookin' for us gangstas, then we in the back
With the all gray and blue on, D.P.G. on the hat
They call me Daz Dilly bitch, loco, more she intact
And at that get your lungs collapsed, perhaps you prefer that

Man, sit, let me spit, a little game to you
Let me introduce my homie to you
You're just a hype, mush me out
Unleash on these hoes
Turn into a motherfuckin' beast on these hoes
Get your head right, game right, aim right
Get everything right, with all your might
Or you might not see daylight, AK might spray your night
The total eclipse at night
The force is fly (high), shootin' out shit that scorch the sky
Stops at the sparks that fly
I'ma forcified, and I'm forced to try
With all my might to get the force to fly
Bigg Snoop, demands we stay on point like Stacey Adams (Dogghouse!)

This Is The Life I Lead

Through my eyes as a youngster, never ran the hood as a busta
Tryin' to make somethin' out of nothin'
Disrespectin' and cussin', bein' wild
The only child, in '95 my brother died
It only made me stronger to survive
As I walk through it now, bein' ready for whatever
Fire with these eyes, shootin' just to get high, whatever
Truely weeded and high, blastin' niggas for highs
Beatin' suckas with straps, chrome bars, and ties
I make 'em all remember so you niggas never ever forget
Who be runnin' this shit
You'll get batted from an angle
You'll get torched out then strangled
We shootin' for every angle so prepare for the day
That's how you wanted it, on some rugged shit
24/7 stay thugged up and blunted bitch

My old ways made me misbehave
Nowadays wicked ways, out there just gettin' paid
My ex lady think I'm strung out
Because I drink and smoke my lungs out, they dish my love out
Thugged out, tweakin' and seekin' for a dream
That almost came true, what's the future for me?
I gave my life to you niggas, how would you repay with anger?
Hangin' y'all niggas like a hanger (fuck y'all)
True bangers, real soldiers
The more I live the more I get older
Hustlin' and bustin' y'all niggas from the shoulders
To let you know you ain't runnin' this show
I gave my soul for a pot of gold
I was young, now I'm livin' life too old
I'll watch the gauge explode
I told you niggas, don't never speak my name no more (nigga!)
Now I'm clutchin' on the fo'-fo', I keep my weapon and steppin'
Somebody in the house tonight is goin' to Hell or Heaven
I try my best, never to always be slippin'
Everyday a single day y'all niggas come up missin'
I double up to make a come up
I'm sorry if they come runnin' if they all get done up
And any motherfucker can bleed

Livin' life by the gun or the knife
High as a kite, cold wilin' through the night
Stackin' hundreds, kept in case you hoes comin'
Young gunnin', tortured and then you'll be punished
My weed habit is just a big cabbage
Lifestyle was lavish, livin' my life unbalanced
It was a challenge, livin' my life like a savage
To have it or not to have it, or nobody could have it
Untouchable, indestructible
Nigga get in my way and I'll dust a few
As a kid this the type of shit that I dreamed of 
Money, cars, bitches, and drugs
I prevailed the murder trail that's got me jailed
At the end of a story will my truth be prevailed? (hell nah)

If you want to go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

If you want to go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

In the club on the late night, feeling right
Looking, trying to spot something real nice
Looking for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home
(I can take home)
She can be 18 (18) with an attitude
Or 19, kinda snotty, acting real rude
But as long as you a thicky-thicky-thick girl you know that it's on
(Know that it's on)
I peep something coming towards me on the dance floor
Sexy and real slow
Saying she was peeping and I dig the last video
""So when Nelly, can we go?"" How could I tell her no?
Her measurements were 36-25-34
I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you, boo, from way over there

Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

Face and body Frontenac, don't know how to act
Without no vouchers on her boots she's bringing nothing back
You should feel the impact, shop on plastic
When the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that
Watch me as I gas that 4 dot 6 Range
Watch the candy paint change, every time I switch lanes
It feel strange now
Making a living off my brain, instead of 'caine now
I got the title from my momma put the whip in my own name now
Damn shit done changed now
Running credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)
Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town
I'm getting pages out of New Jersey from Courtney B
Telling me about a party up in NYC
And can I make it? Damn right, I be on the next flight
Paying cash; first class - sitting next to Vanna White

And I've got something to tell ya
You won't believe how many people straight doubted the flow
Most said that I was a failure
But now the same motherfuckers asking me for dough
And I'm yelling: ""I can't help ya""
""But Nelly can we get tickets to the next show?""
Hell no (what's witchyou?!) you for real?!

Hey yo, now that I'm a fly guy, and I fly high
Niggas want to know why: why I fly by
But yo, it's all good, Range Rover all wood
Do me like you should - fuck me good, suck me good
We be them stud niggas, 'wishing you was' niggas
Popping like we drug dealers, sipping Crissy, bubb' macking
Honey in the club, me in the Benz
Icy grip, telling me to leave with you and your friends
So if shorty want to knock, we knocking to this
And if shorty want to rock, we rocking to this
And if shorty want to pop, we popping the Crist'
Shorty wanna see the ice, then I ice the wrist
City talk, Nelly listen; Nelly talk, city listen
When I fuck fly bitches; when I walk pay attention
See the ice and the glist'; niggas staring or they diss
Honies looking all ""they wish"" - come on boo, gimme kiss

Anythin' I desire my boost, she made it happin'
The back bone of my gangsterism that keep me balanced

With the paper at the game, broken up with some name
No matter what she would treat me the same
But I was wrong, I started to singin' another song
But she was weak minded, so grinded our love was gone

Fusin' and fightin'
Every morning 'til the break of dawn
Materialistic bullshit
That's what this is based on

All night she love me when I eat it up
We kick real hard and if a nigga don't beat it up
I'm down for you, you down for me like Bonny and Clyde
She showed the gangsterism when it's time to rock

Our attitude is messed up, me and the motherly
The ghetto relationships that you go through as lovers
The wrong choice to begin with
Slam it on usin' profanities, tryin' get me locked up quick

Pushin' and shove in', fightin' and fusin'
Well, we made up like that, with a lotta kissin' and fuckin'
She forgave me, I forgave you, it's back like we were

Forgiven, now I'm living like a man full of Jesus
It was hell until I fell upon my knees and prayed
But now the yoke that I was totin' has been taken away

""Better is open rebuke, than hidden love""

As love drives them near

Pretending we are blind to the calling
This is my point and case, if hate can be erased
With such a simple phrase, why are we stalling?

It took me a while to catch what it said

The words that he spoke made the people assume
There wasn't too much left in the upper room

At the risk of seeking purpose
How can I hang in this environmental state of being
When everything I'm striving for
Is nothing that I'm seeing 

Won't You take my heart, won't You take my soul
Won't You come and make me whole again
You, You've got what I need and You never retreat
Unto You I will concede

Before I come unglued
Call it my addiction
I can't get enough of You
So help me God
To put my faith in You

And Jesus ain't the latest thing to come across the wire
I throw myself at mercy for I am the chief of sinners
But daily taking up my cross
Has brought it's share of splinters 

You're there when I call
And You're there when I fall
Even though I don't deserve it all
You, You light my way
Through the night and the day
And from You I will not stray  

God so help me
This is my soul plea
I'm desperately devoted
I can't get enough of You
So help me God

In deine scheiß Brust bis du weiches Ei Blei spuckst

Auf deine Stirn und jage die Kugel in dein verficktes Gehirn
Plündere deine Tasche und verpiss mich von hier

Dann heißt es auch schon gleich in den Bau
Weil ich auch noch Gangster bin wenn der Beat nicht mehr läuft
Ne Quatsch, war ein Witz, mach in wieder an, ich hab Schiss
Sido findet meine Witze nicht zum Lachen
Kann man von einem Mario Barth-Fan auch wirklich nicht erwarten
Nach diesen beiden Zeilen ist der Beef auch schon beendet

Of a sermon that no one will hear

De Danann,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin

And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do

Aan 't type waar je niet op valt

Maar 'k heb niemand ooit aanbeden of vereerd

Duizend keer heb ik me vergist
Duizend keer de verkeerde smaak
Zonder je te kennen heb ik je gemist

De mooiste en de liefste
Hartstochtelijk, spontaan
Ik laat je nooit, nee nooit
Ik laat je nooit meer gaan
Het lot daar kun je in geloven
Als je aan anderen de keuze laat
Maar ik kies zelf en hou m'n leven zo in eigen hand
Ik wil er liever middenin staan
Dan dat ik sta te kijken langs de kant
Refr.
Ik dwaalde en zocht
En wist nooit (waar ik uit zou komen)
Ik sliep regelmatig bij vage vriendinnen
Met wie ik uiteindelijk niets wou beginnen
Soms iets teveel, iets te vaak (risico's genomen)

Maar deze keer, deze keer is 't raak
Want je bent

Que te expresas de mi

También de la forma que tú me describías

Dime que tengo que hacer pa' conquistar tu piel
Solo explícame porque es tan difícil acercarme a usted

Y se reía cada vez que algo gracioso decía
Me interesaba, interrogaba  y no mentía

Me interesaba besarla y no podía
Sentí mi corazón como fuerte latía
Y ella seguía con una dulce simpatía

Me interesaba interrogaba y no mentía
Me interesaba besarla y no podía
No me esperaba esto cuando ella me beso

El pensamiento que anhelaba, nena ya se cumplió
Ahora estamos los dos para los dos
Descarguemos esta sensación

Dime que tengo que hacer pa' conquistar tu piel
Solo explícame porque es tan difícil acercarme a usted

Me gusta el color rosita como esos labio que queda 
Su fama finje por dentro pero caliente por fuera 
Me encanta todo lo que tienes, somos como almas gemelas 
El jacuzzi lleno de velas, escuchando 

Dime dónde estás que si tú quieres mami, yo voy 
Te digo la verdad, te digo quién soy 
Quiere que le meta lento como yo 
Rápido como el Geezy y baja el tubo ya Krissy, babe

Sentirme dentro de tu piel 
Te quiero amar y más que ayer 
Hablando claro quiero recorrer 
Todo de ti y saciar tu sed (Geezy baby)

Quiero sentirme dentro de tu piel 
Y yo quiero amarte más que ayer 
Hablando claro quiero recorrer 
Todo de ti y saciar tu sed

Y'all are crazy, no chains, dag, okay, where's your BMW?
You're not supposed to walk, where's your jeeps, your Maximas?
Maximas? Yo, Maxin' would break my flow and with the cause of gas

Don't you know you can't be def if you don't have no gold?
Or a car, man? What's up? Who told you that?

Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute shorty, you're buggin'
Do you like Plug Tunin' and Potholes? Yeah that song's def
But we don't wear no gold chains, nor do we ride BMW's
And Maxes or Jeeps, but you still think our music is def, right?
Wait a minute, did I say 'def'? Rrah! What?

Nothing, nothing, it's just that we don't deal with all that
Materialistic stuff, but we still got what it takes to please
And supply our listeners, understand my man?
Where's your beepers? Why don't you have beepers?
Everybody wears beepers, you have to have beepers to look down

Augh, little man is brainwashed indeed
Nah, nah, beepers are the least of status situators, man
Plus I find them ugly as parking tickets, you guys talk funny
Well ,actually our verbal is kinetic, so when released flow A to Z
Is perfectly pitched in andvance in intricacy

De La Soul,"Once again it's time to buy more soul
A flavor you will savor in your soul
Wax is distributed and then sold
So watch it turn, bring your next of kin soul
P.A. Mase has rocked it on the console
Scream real hard until you blow your tonsils
Bang-oh-bang until you burn your shoe soles
Cause you are now dancing to the new soul

Live is the motion of the soul step
Set the exposure to my one step
This scene'll last to the next step
All those in favor take a big step
True to the Soul, we'll never back step
In sense to that, we don't half step
Just as a reminder from the last step
Negative ones are lost in footsteps

Levels we've set will never go down
Competitions commence the step down
Those involved with peace who know the Soul's down
Can see that the Soul has got a new sound
Dance until you find yourself a new part
If you don't then I'll give you the True part
When received you'll see the real small part
Of the new way is no part at all

Pos and Dove is rarely caught not dressed in peace
Movements always walking round now stressing peace
When this biter should know true in peace
Instead they cause violence and shoot out beef

I'm right up to bat
It's a Daisy Age and you're about to walk top-stage
So wipe your Lottos on the mat
Hip-hop love this is and don't mind when I quiz your
Involvements before the sun
But clear your court cause this is a one-man sport
And who's better for this than Plug One
Now you don't have to worry about me squashin' other deals
Cause they've already been squooshed
Freeze a frame about moods the same which we can continue
Right behind the bush
You'll stay with me
Eye Know this
But not because of all my Earthly treasures
Or regardless to the fact that I'm Posdnuos
But because

Eye know Eye love you better

May I cut this dance to introduce myself as
The chosen one to speak
Let me lay my hand across yours
And aim a kiss upon your cheek
The name's Plug Two
And from the soul I bring you
The Daisy of your choice
May it be filled with the pleasure principle
In circumference to my voice
About those other Jennys I reckoned with
Lost them all like a homework excuse
This time the Magic Number is two
Cause it takes two, not three, to seduce
My destiny of love is brought to an apex
Sex is a mere molecule
In this world of love that I have for you
It's true

Eye know Eye love you better

Now it's time to let this rhyme style
Get somewhat poured in the mold
Take my hand and we'll pick my plantation
Of Daisies for a bouquet of Soul
Life will begin at the cut of a rim
Take it as filled to the rim as in brim
Squeeze your stoop like Betty Boop
We'll make Campbell's Alphabet Soup
And spell Plug One's within
Forward march is the say
When transistors will play
Come into bed is the mood
Dolby sound will be then top crowned
When I put the needle into your groove
I got a good thing
And in full swing
I show this in gifts, words or letters
But even without those three
Eye know you'll be close to me cause

Eye know Eye love you better

It's I again and the song that I send
Is taking steps to reach your heart
Any moment you feel alone
I can fill up your empty part
We can ascend 'till we reach De La Heaven
And in a spin we'll hit the Top Ten
Then we will meet Mr Stuckie
And Pos' brother Lucky will preach
Let the wedding begin
Shot by an arrow of cupid
Through the string of a G-clef
My dear, I claim you're def
And if you can hear me, by golly gee
Trugoy is ready for what you posess
We could live in my Plug Two home
And on Mars where we could be all alone
And we make a song for two

Auditions are gathered but the Soul would just rather
Hold a count at three and in the end leave it as it is
Flow to the sway of my do-re-mi

(Hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmmm)
(Mmm-hmm, yeah)

Vocal in doubt is an uplift
And real is the answer that I answer with
Dying yet live, what you must realize
That the tune that I present is surely not a gift
Different in style is definite
And style which I flaunt is sure legit
Now set aside, I say I hold pride
In performing this melodic misfit
So swing cause this pitcher is pitching
In sense JD Dove is now saying
All sing along to his favorite song
While the pocket transistors are playing
But least but not last I'm frightened
For the words that I reply hold doom
Life of the check can be stopped by accident
When you're tripping the wire of the Plug Tune

De La Soul,"I was walking on the water when I saw a crocodile
He had daisies in his hat, so I stopped him for a while
He delivered me a message, a massage to soothe my stage
What it was was more then plug-up dosage
More than DAISY age
Conversation drew a rule
Which the crowd will roar by millions
Mr. Crocodile said, 'Dove, you must look
For now the villains try to hold you underwater
But one thing we all must heed
Sony Walkmans keep us walking
De La Soul can help you breathe when you tread water'

As I walked along my journey
I thought 'What have I just learned?'
In a flash I saw commotion
There was movement in these ferns
Silently the silence came, was it the end of my world?
I shouted out in fear, 'Who's there?'
'It's me,' said Mr. Squirrel
'I've searched for you all over, now you're found
No time to waste. We must find the Preacher Man
We must find the P.A. Mase, all my population's dying
And we're all in tune to doom
Like the Daisy, I need water
I need chesnuts to consume'
'Mr. Squirrel,' I said, 'I'm sorry
But the problem can't be solved
If there's no one here to help, and no one to get involved
Always look to the positive and never drop your head
For the water will engulf us if we do not dare to tread
So let's tread water'

Now one weary day I woke, my alarm said 'Plug time's up'
Filled my bath up with the water, gargled with my gargle cup
As I bathed I felt a presence, and I'm sort of ticklish
I looked down and then around and I heard
'Hi! I'm Mr Fish. How do you do? As for me
I'm in tip-top shape today, cause my water's clean
And no-one's menu says Fresh Fish Filet
See I look past all my worries, which is something you must do
Though you're fed up, throw your head up
With this advice from me to you
And that's to tread water'

As my day went unexplained, time was finding nothing fun
As I walked along the sidewalk, I heard
'Psst, excuse me, Plug One'
From my Soul, De La that is, I hollered
'Yes, are you talking to me?'
'No alarm meant,' he said, 'Let me introduce myself
I'm Mr Monkey'
'Mr Monkey, I pledge you slap of five
Now how does your problem meet?'
He said, 'My bananas are at their ripest, but they all
Stand at three feet. My swinging hand is bandaged up
Could you help me with this chore?'
I brought him down to the Native shop
And bought him copies of the De La score
Which assisted well in his elevation
Now all bananas is at his grasp
He decided with this accomplished
He would put me on to the path
He to my to live by the Inner Sound, y'all
Which would bring me health in showbiz
Then to use them, not abuse them
And then in the words that got me to 'em
And that is to tread water",Tread Water
De La Soul,"Connection A, click, what?
My dick, chick
I smack a fish if you thinks
My connection ain't thick, dick
Headed like a punk whip
I travel miles with a rhythmic lip
I rock an Afro
In '83, gee, yo
And spray the sheen so I get a Soul Glow
I play the corner tough
And me and Mase pull puffs on a blunt

Givin' high-five is what I want
So I puff a blunt, I don't front
I get spliffed, get a stiff
Then I go hump a stunt
Like a pimp pro
(Nah, man, a super ho)
That's cool cause I'm still an Afro bro
Yeah, I'm live for my life is hectic
Every hour, every minute, every second
I keep a level head and stay down to earth
Cause I've been an Afro since birth

Yeah
Now I hold my crotch cause I'm top-notch
I run amok Sasquatch, and I like to eat live crab
I've got five beepers, you scab
But you can find me directly on the Ave
(You niggas cheat me, well who's that!)
My breath never smells wack
I eat the watermelon Tic-Tac
Before I kiss myself I always jump back
(Yo, gee, this track is stack)
(And you know that)

I do three flips
When a punk flip on my duke lifts
But I flex more strength when I'm asleep
On the other side with his main tapes
Make her dry her face, buy her gold earlocks
But I may, she flocks round me like a donut
She got sprinkles but I bite my way out
More brothers come about, try to scheme slick
But the Native Tongue's thick
Lick 'em real good, like a real hood should
But the fly tape let the car speakers shake
I ran a cop down, I smile a frown with a but
Show gold teeth, cause I ain't a vegetarian
Not scared of beef, sport a feather like Chief
Got a scribble pad, you can get these gonads
Cause I'm big-willed, blow off like a seal
Cause connection with the Afro is real

I be the gift of gab, but be a bro with a diss
Because it's tough to bluff a cab
No wonder Melle Mel is 'Rrrr-RAH!'
I play of tape of the son of La-di-da
My cousin Rilo sells blow, a G a day
Keeps his kids hooray, a size nine and half
I kicks my tricks, is to live for Island
I mug a mug vic, but I's cool, I self
With the quickness I bust the true slang
Show no pit to those who don't understand

The Maseo got tailed with the big bail
I busted loose but now the blue goose is on my tail
I seen the ghetto go lower than it is
(He don't care, cause his nigga's selling crack to the kids)
My jeans are brand new, with twelve more
In the closet with my silk, and below
My 45 pack thick, draw quick
If a nigga starts some shibidibidit
My crib is uptown, downtown, L.I
And another crib in Queens
I munch some cornbread, Boar's Head
My favorite pork chops and
A plate of collar greens
I chill with Shymel, Akeem, Jaheed
And the Rastafarians'll be the crown in
And the Poppa
But the connections are still a high-five

Like two eggs, and a slop beef slice of lettuce
And a glass of milk and some cookies
Spotted in the mist was a bk logo
What we said well what do you know
This chick thought I was trying to play fly
'Cause I had a pair of blue jeans on

Young girl, won't you take my order? 
She said, ""yeah, but right now I'm sorta busy
Can't you see I'm trying to put this band aid on my finger? ""
Lingering, I could tell
She's a b-k mademoiselle
Ripped uniform and bottom bell
And some jelly stuff on her sleeve
Look to this cause I had no name tag on my collar
Could be pissed cause she's clocking 2. 45 an hour
And then boss hog hollar
Girl you better make this quick! 
She said, ""I ain't your girl and I ain't your chick! ""

Took my hat off and that was it

Yeah now we'll see!

Yo, can I interest you in some burgers and fries? 
Yes you can, but you can keep your lies
Cause you know you can't diss me
But your pissing me off
I know where you live and I know that you're soft
You're as booty as they come (booty? )
And you dress like a geek
My shoes cost more than you make in two weeks
Look, you don't have to play fly in here
I can tell your fly by the weave that you wear! 
but you must be aware that a fly can be swatted by a Bk tray
By the way yo, here's yours
I know your just sweating me to kill the noise
Of your polyester pants and thier o' so high waters
Look at what you do all day but take orders
You bow tie wearing, clocking and staring
I know your just upset because you can't get the rap
I think you chubby for my man is living slack

Selling devil rock to the fiends and the fools! 
With one hand that punk I could snap the kid is so skinny
But we be livin fat
Speaking of fat, would you like a diet soda? 
'Cause less fat on you would spare us all the odor

But your stomachs always big from the sexual slip ups!

Only wanna bowl, got nabbed for the fame

Just kidding, I know it's Renee
No, it isn't? Word, word, well check it out
Check, check it out

And get with this Pos position

Would you let me in if I was to sing

Yo, Maseo, blow this scene

Dip, dip, di, you're making me cry
With that onion between your thighs
Come give me some of that brown sugar
So the sweets can make me active
If I said you were attractive
May I supplement with an additive?
Hey, hooker let me hook you with my reel
Take you to the crib, cook up a real meal
Skip the meal and walk this way

Come on into my room, here we go
Here we here we here we go

(Boom!) Did you feel the floor shake?
(Boom!) Did you feel the earth quake?
(Boom!) Now, quick, do you wanna take a break?

De La Soul,"This is the stylin' for a title that sounds silly
But nothin' silly about the triflin' times of Millie
Millie a Brooklyn Queen originally from Philly
Complete with that accent that made her sound hillbilly
Around this time the slammin' joint was “Milk is Chillin'”
But even cooler was my social worker Dillon
Yeah I had a social worker 'cuz I had some troubles
Anyone who'd riff on me, I'd pop their dome like bubbles
He'd bring me to his crib to watch my favorite races
That's how his daughter Millie became one of my favorite faces
She had the curves that made you wanna take chances
I mean on her, man, I'd love to make advances
I guess her father must 'a got the same feelin'
I mean, actually findin' his own daughter Millie appealing
At the time no one knew but it was a shame
That Millie became a victim of the touchy-touchy game

Yo Millie, what's the problem, lately you've been buggin'
On your dookie earrings, someone must be tuggin'
You were a dancer who could always be found clubbin'
Now you're world renowned with the frown you're luggin'
Come to think your face look stink when Dill's around you
He's your father-what done happen-did he ground you?
You shouldn't flip on him 'cuz Dill is really cool
Matter of fact, the coolest elder in the school
He hooked up a trip to bring us all the Lacey
He volunteered to play old Santa Claus at Macy's
Child, ya got the best of pops anyone could have
Dillon's cool, super hip, you should be glad

Yeah, it seemed that Santa's ways were parallel with Dillon
But when Millie and him got home, he was more of a villain
While she slept in he crept inside her bedroom
And he would toss and then would force her to give him head room
Millie tried real hard to let this hell not happen
But when she'd fuss, he would just commence to slappin'
(Yo Dillon man, Millie's been out of school for a week, man, what's
The deal?)
I guess he was givin' Millie's bruises time to heal
Of course he told us she was sick and we believed him
And at the department store as Santa we would see 'em
And as he smiled, his own child was at home plottin'
How off the face of this earth she was gonna knock him
When I got home, I found she had tried to call me
My machine had kicked to her hey how ya doin' (sorry)
I tried to call the honey but her line was busy
I guess I'll head to Macy's and bug out on Dillon

I received a call from Misses Sick herself
I asked her how was she recoverin' her health
She said that what she had to ask would make it seem minute
She wanted to talk serious, I said, ""go ahead-shoot""
She claimed I hit the combo dead upon the missile
Wanted to know if I could get a loaded pistol
That ain't a problem but why would Millie need one
She said she wanted her pops Dillon to heed one
Ran some style about him pushin' on her privates
Look honey, I don't care if you kick five fits
There's no way that you can prove to me that Dill's flip
He might breathe a blunt but ya jeans he wouldn't rip
You're just mad he's your overseer at school
No need to play him out like he's someone cruel
She kicked that she would go get it from somewhere else
Yeah, whatever you say, go for ya self

Macy's department store, the scene for Santa's kisses
And all the little brats demandin' all of their wishes
Time passes by as I wait for my younger brother
He asks his wish, I waste no time to return him back to Mother
As I'm jettin', Millie floats in like a zombie
I ask her what's her problem, all she says is ""Where is he?""
I give a point, she pulls a pistol, people screamin'
She shouts to Dill, “He's off to hell cuz he's a demon!”
None of the kids could understand what was the cause
All they could see was a girl holdin' a pistol on Claus
Dillon pleaded mercy, said he didn't mean to
Do all the things that her mind could do nothing but cling to
Millie bucked him and with the quickness it was over",Millie Pulled a Pistol on Santa
De La Soul,"Brother, brother oh brother of mine
We used to be down as partners in crime
From our parents our name was forged
I was the Beaver, you Curious George
Wanted to dispose of this and that
But curiosity had killed the cat
At this age no wonder it was read
But this was the fate that you were fed
Throughout high school our minds we'd waste
High off all the cheeba that we could taste
Soon you had converted to nasal sports
Every five minutes cocaine you'd snort
Told me that you needed a stronger fix
Stepped to the crack scene in '86
Unlike the other drugs where you had control
This substance had engulfed your body and soul
Now from me you lost all respect
Said yo need to put that shit in check
Wanted me to believe that you had tried
But your mind and the craving had coincided
Said there was a voice inside you that talked
Which said you shouldn't stop but continue to walk
Now the brother who could handle any drug
Had just found the one that could pull his Plug

""Yo, bro, got another rock for your hiking boots""
""Gonna make you scream and loop three loops""
""Gonna take you far on a freeway, okay""
Remember that day? Slipped me a smile for a 20 crack vial
Guess what? Time to collect, correct
Don't have a dime? It's payback time, payback time
""Don't cry the blues cause I got bad news""
""Should I stab ya? Should I bite ya? Should I use my tools?""
No, I got another way to earn my defeat, ah!
(Slam the child on the hard concrete)

Brother, brother, stupid brother of mine
Started getting high at the age of nine
Now at twenty-one you're lower than low
Nowhere to turn, nowhere to go
My dividends and wares started to disappear
Where it ended up, I had an idea
Barking you with the quickness, reversed intent
Instead went to Pop and gave him the print
Now Pop grew tired of being a mouse
Finally told you to get the hell outta the house
From there a mother figure came into play
Claimed for you she saw a better day
Now Mom was a product of Christ's rebirth
Thought the only chance was to go to church
Quitting this stuff you had tried before
This time you claimed you'd really score
Something I had to see to believe
Put on my suit and to church I weaved

My, my, my. What happened to the people? The people who used to care
About what took place in the world today? I've been summoned here
Today to reach the people who still can be reached, to save the people
Who still can be saved. Can I get an Amen? Can I get an Amen?
Hit me! Forgive us. Said it's taking over. Taking over the world. All
It's doing is taking over. Where them crackers at? Them crackers that
They serve, where they at?

Bullshit, didn't believe a lick
To this fool fell off, well that would stick
Then again you benefited the doubt
Wanted to see if you would work it out
Soon you reach your front of calm
Walked round by rehearsing psalms
Then you smiled with the funky frown
What do you know, the voice is back in town
Mom would say it would soon go away
You and I knew it was here to stay
But the man helped you when you helped yourself
That meant going to rehab for your health
Finally it went and blew your cork
Heard you moved to the comfortable streets of New York
And when my friends see me and come and ask
""Yo, where's your brother at?""
I'll be the first to splash
""Yo, he's a basehead""",My Brother's a Basehead
De La Soul,"Oodles and oodles of O's, you know
You get 'em from my sister
You get 'em from my bro
All I is is man, and once an embryo
Am I solid gold? I don't cast a glow

Yes, I guess it's reflex some have no control
I'd rather let a laughter and tally, off I go
Canoeing up the river or out into the O
You just know me not so not play the role
Some are lovey-Dovey, ah you crazies know
Some shake your hand but (this is called the show)
I was John Doe, now I'm Mr. Jolicoeur
Pissed with the witness, and now I adore
O's got the world cause O's was on tour
Girls gave the O's, and guys, oh for sure
Were they arose, well nobody knows
What do they mean, well here's how it goes
Oh shoot's got the O's when you hold the dough
You know who you are but they didn't know
And now with respect they flex like a pro
You're first another nigga but now an Afro

In your eye burning like rubbing alcohol
Native is the Tongue that speaks the Guacomo
Kinfolk will play this in stere-ere-o
Chanters play the part of a herd at a show
Pos prints the peace on his jeans or Girbauds
But let the herd know if beef they wanna throw
Lunches of punches is what I bestow
Oodles of O's it has my hoes in mic checks
O's take the shape of medallions and specs
Don't forget the O's that let the air in my nose
Breathe in the fresh as the stale hit the road
Girls ask for flicks and I'll block the pores
Eat the Al Greens, won't sniff the Kurt Blows
Mase got something to say and it goes

Hoods like to play macho, you know
Guns going ""Bo!"", people hit the floor
Don't have a piece but an arrow and bow
Target it firm cause I'm head Comancho
Charging barricades like a raging rhino
The donuts come big and some in jumbo
The landlord is finished but before I go
I'll give a shout out to Quest and my fellow Jungle Bros

Knocked by the dock of the bay by the shore
Swimming in the rhythm of the hi-de-hi-de-ho
Punk Pinocchios gotta go, gotta go
(What's the reason?) to be cheerful
Season is breeze, time to pimp promote
Nuts can no flow if the shade is in the dough
On with me hat, d-d-duh-duh-doh
Dreadlock is heading out the door y'all

Now I like, I like I like to plug the real thing
So loose, so loose, so loose with the tap dance
The funk, the funk, funky funky stuff I bring
My tribe, my tribe, my tribe is known as Native Tongues
Consists, consists, consists of Jungle, Quest and others
Get played, get played, played a lot on radio
And also, and also, and also by some foul brothers
The Pease, the Pease the Pease Porridge never failed
It kept, it kept us calm, our stylin' merry
But late, but lately loonies acting real bold
Can't sip in luxury my apple cranberry
Girls watch, and watch, and watch I dance the big tut
Our home, our home our homeboys has to plan tricks
Don't real, don't real, don't realise the Native Tongue
Is rollin' strong and we're startin' in the megamix

Question, and that's if only I can ask this question
Can I? (Yes you can!)
Why do people think just because we speak peace
We can't blow no joints?
(I-I-I don't know)

Mase, this is the ninth day I've reheated this porridge. You know it
Keeps me peacefully, no?

Yeah, but my tolerance level has now peaked
And now it's time for some heads to get flown

We bring, we bring, we bring, we bring the peace of course
But pack a nine inside, inside my De La drawers
A picture, picture, picture, picture painted pink
Could turn to red, to red, to red in blooded quick
But in a single file my Native Tongue is calm
I'd rather, rather pass a brother a pound or palm
I kick, I kick, I kick a verse of unity
And shack, and shackle steps to the beat, beat
I click, I click the TV to the Simpsons
And sip the Porridge deep into my system
So mel, so mellow mode is my day mode
Inside the studio or on a road
The Shwing, the Shwingalo is the now step
It's murder if you bet cause you're life's jep
To praise, to praise the Soul is on a down drag
It's false, because I'll spray you with the Black Flag

Don't und, don't understand the act of being foul
Hey D, hey D, hey DJ set the record up
It's time, it's time, it's time to tame the naughty pups
Throw on the Touching Fingers serenade
So we can throw our lemonade
In their face and kick their little butts

People wanna get ragged with the reruns
Me not, me not, me not scared to trudge a bit
They can't, they can't, they can't get close to none
I tap, I tap, I tap a dance war skit
The por, the por, the Porridge got crazy cold
We won't, we won't eat until the heads are flown
Take advantage to a cool one's peaceful ways
But when, but when we fly that head all the people say

Here in Frogland, we always eat our Porridge, cause it keeps us frogs
Real peaceful like

I be like ""Oh swell""

And tell them to call me at noon

The Shwingalo, hot damn
(Is Posdnuos gonna start?)
I am, I am
(And by the order of Shwing on hand)
I present to you the Preacher Man
Peace everyone, everyone I hope
Plate is not a caper, plate is not a hoax
Is it is the now step, labeled Shwingalo
Shopper brag a basket, fill it to the bro
What's the Shwingalokate? Question me instead
Mental is the mood, whether live or dead
Level is the groove when I lead the led
But hip is my lip when I'm Shwinging it

(On and on at two steps ahead)

(What's the next step?)
It's the fool of the clan
(Is he down with the Shwing?)
I am, I am
(And by the order of Swing on hand)
I present to you, the whole shalam
Last was the gas, flower by the pound
Shoo, puppy tough, shoo, flower power hound
Season of the Shwing is sound and it's bound
90 got the gift so lift from the ground
Speak me an age, age at the dough
Feed me the donut, feed me the O
School me with the new cause the new
Kept me fed with the brew
I'm glued to the stew and I'm Shwinging it

Breathe me the out, breathe me the in
Send it with a skit neither friend nor begin
Label it a Shwing, brother come for the win
Catch me the border, must start to begin
90 got the knack of the Soul, grab a bit
90 proved them wrong to those who commit
Dis to the hit list, pitched by the hit
Caught by the herds of those in the pit
Pull me a puff of the blunt as it breeds
This benefit's just what you need
Just because I'm fallin', saved by the weed
With dred, cause you know indeed I'm shwinging it

(On and on at two steps ahead)

Constructed like an apple but roll like a grape
Try with the games cause the fools'll take shape
Stuff to the too tough, grave is in the groove
Sop it like Sound, yo honey make a move
Shufflin' your feet, that's stiffer than a nap
Open up an eardrum, don't wait for the cap
Sip a third of lager, extract the waste
Tell me tell me tell me, can you get a case?
Never oops honey, dope not a threat
Peace be found on your color telly set
Pick up the proof for the stool pigeon sing
Shwing a load o' dat, cause I must put Shwing

(Hey)

Hey Love
Talkin' bout Hey Love
Wanna be your push and shove
Pop, popcorn up above
Move me like Soul when I say
Go to a club around the way
And see my Hey DJ
And make him play Hey Love
Discover all the football teams
Mack and eat jelly beans
Run in the cold with no jeans
Get yourself sick till we're seen
Catch the flu and make tea
How Dan Stuckie life will be
It's all about you and me
Cause you're my Hey Love

Move me like Soul when I say
Go to a club around the way
And see my Hey DJ
And make him play Hey Love

Look Pos, we gotta talk
Talk about what?
Don't play stupid with me, you know what we gotta talk about
What?
About you becoming fully dedicated
So we're about to go through these line-runs again, huh?
You're damn right. I wanna know whatever you do for me has
Anything to do with love
Look, I come all the way from L.I. to the Bronx to see you, isn't
That showing you love?
You see that's just it Pos, I don't wanna be just your Bronx
Love, I wanna be your Hey Love
You wanna be my what?
I said I wanna be your Hey Love. I mean it's just not the mood
Being one of the many girls on your
List, and you wouldn't be dissing me like this if I was your Hey Love
Look, I do everything I can to treat you like a rose
Yeah but you even give better treatment to that girl named
Selina from uptown like a Daisy. You even
Gave her some of your special donuts for free
So this is what this is all about, huh? Donuts
No, Pos, can't you hear the music, it's all about Hey Love
I don't understand why you're dissing me, it's not like I'm Paul
I don't have two kids in every state
But you probably got two girls in every state, if you're not
Going to go about it the way I want you

I think I'll go down to Goliath and just be a fuckin' dickhead!
Damn, I feel good today
I'm looking forward to going and just beating
the shit out of someone and taking their money
What a fucking great job I have!

I wonder why I feel so good. Could it be the music?
Could it be my breakfast? Or could it just be the fact that
I just hate everybody, dammit!
Life is grand, life is great, I'll get myself a real cheap date
Some woman I can take to McDonalds, spend a dollar twenty-five on

And your number
And I'll get back to you

Once again it's another rap bandit
Fiending at I and I can't stand it
Wanna be down with the Day-Glo
Knocking on my door, saying, ""a yo yo""
Knocking on my door, saying, ""a yo yo""
""I got a funky new tune with a fly banjo""
I can't understand what the problem is
I find it hard enough dealing with my own biz
How'd they get my name and number
Then I stop to think and wonder
Bout a plan, yo man, I gotta step out town
You wanna call me up? Take my number down
It's 222-2222
I got an answering machine that can talk to you
It goes

Hey how ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
But leave your name and your number
And I'll get back to you

Yo, check it, exit the old style, enter's the new
But nothing's new 'bout being hawked by a crew
Or should I say flock cause around every block
There's Harry, Dick, and Tom, with a demo in his palm
Now I'm with helping those who want to help themselves
And flaunt a nut that's doggy as in dope
But it's not the mood to hear
The tales of limousines and pails
Of money they'll make like a pro
I be like, ""Yo black, just play me the tape""
But at the show the time to spare I just make
But the songs created in they shacks
Are so wick-wick-wack, situations like this
And now I hate they give me smiles Kool-Aid wide and ask
""Was it def?""
And with the straighest face I be like, ""Hell yes""
I slip them the digits to Papa Prince Paul
So I don't go AWOL but yet I know when they call
They get

Party at the dug-out on Diction Ave
Haven't been to the jam in quite a while
Figure I'll catch up on the latest styles
'Stead piles and piles of demo tapes bi-da miles
All I wanna do is cut on the decks wild
But edition up here bi-da miles to the center
Reliever of duty, Plug One mosies in
And I be like, ""Yo G, Pos does all the producing""

Now woe is me to the third degree
Mase pulls the funny so I make like a bunny
Jettin'
But I'm getting used to this demo abuse
Getting raped and giving birth to a tape
Cause there's no escape from the clutches of a hawker
Attached to my success, sent like a stalker
Make way to my radius playin fly guy
Try to get on my back they force like Luke Sky
Me Myself and I go through this act daily
And rarely do I not
No matter how I dodge some jackal always nails me
No matter what the plot
And even out on tour they be like
""Yo I got a tape to play you back at the hotel""
I be like ""Oh swell""
Unveil the numeric code to dial my room
And tell them to call me at noon
But of course there's no answering machine in my room
But a pretty young adorer
Who I swung on tour
And if it rings while we're alone
She'll answer the phone
And with the quickness she'll recite like a poem

""Hey, you done did the right thing, dial up my ring ring
Now you're waiting on the beep
Say, I would love if you'd sing
The tune to Tru instead of fronting on the speak""
So no problemo, just play the demo
And at the end it's break out time
Please oh please don't press rewind
Cause I'll just lay it down the line

Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number

Just another area 
For me to patrol 

Just another area 
That shows I got soul 

Just another area 
For me to patrol 

Just another area 
That shows I got soul 

I got soul you see  
I'm swimming in the De La 
I'm in my hood man  
My manhood worries ya 

I'm known for sampling of soul food 
Off the old school plates 
When I met up with my niggas from the 718 
One the Jungle Bro, the other Questers from Queens 
Yet I had the matrix of the 516 in my jeans 
So I sided with my funk to bring my second on call 
For me and the Sheep, our mission's on the beach of 804 
(You're runnin' on an empty tank) 
But still get paid in full 
(And get the girls) 
Man, I'm packing gravitational pull 
Bring the instamatic avalanche, my code intervenes 
I'm out to scout the areas that remains to be seen 
(What?) 

Well, many many digits had me seeking in my Wizard 
Man, who's ringing up my area  oh! 
I used to shoe it to the bridge but that's gone 
Like the 718's out of Vietnam 
Sniffin' skypagers had me drugged 
(Man I knew a psycho) 
703's on my love bug 
I made mates with the brothers up in 215 
Crazy Buddhas in my mind 
My Chattanooga champ had me late for the camp 
And my 202 keeps me marvelous 
I guess Mars was my hideaway 
But if the stars for a getaway

Since I'm capable I conjure up a walk in this way 
I slip a syllable for Aspen and a Chester souffle 
I be the 919 seeker, 'cause ain't off logic 
So when I'm with my crew I always have a place to sit 
Due to this, a brother tries to play me 
(Yeah, like one in 514) 
Yo, some kid tried to flip on me 
They instigated a brawl 
(So we set our knuckles on stun and made them all fall) 
Then I just laughed 
(Ha ha ha ha ha ha) 

(We whooped that ass) 
And put the feelings aside, I know who I am 
I cast the grain by the pound 
I make sounds with the horn 
When I color the corn, caught the fit 
And sit the two when honey slung the tip 
Well I'm taking my finds to the 301's 
And I'm playing my flute in the rear kibbut 
My man from the 908's, he don't like it like that 
So I pipes till the sunshine hikes 
A kettle of our master plan makes a Malibu idol 
(God forgive me) Well, it's a hook 
The third to the 0 to the 5 had top feel the vibe 
When the 516 played convicts 

The man Maseo is here to put the habit along 
And what you have, I'm 'bout to speak about your area code 
Is it 918? (No) 
Is it 212? (No) 
Speakin' on 404? (Hell no) 
What about 516? (I dunno) 
What is it? (Not tellin' ya) 
What is it? (Not tellin' ya) 
What is it? (Not tellin' ya) 
What is it? (Not tellin' ya) 
(Huh? What?) 

Just another area for me to patrol 
I got status 'cause I'm baddest with the paint 
Giving upside down frowns to London wood 703 
Her moms didn't like it, I had to let be 
For the fact I lays bricks 
'Cause my semen ends with the letter T 
My seed is hard to submerge 
I play the tack in the wall if my rear's not watched 
'Cause some knuckle might just head for the urge 
But I got Prince Paul in the Area 
(Oh, it's like that now) 
I got Hot Dog in the Area 

(Eh eh eh) 

I got the Violators in the area (Ah) 
I's got the Violators in the area (Ah) 
It don't matter where you hide, I clear up the fall 
Cop the fuck outta here, you fake-ass fraud 
Clear my area

My pops gots enough so best to leave or sail the waves

And how I relate, the same side of my gates
Paper days, mess up my mind, ground zero degrees
And the weather feels fine
You opened my eyes man, thought I had a man
But how could I eyescan, I wasn't around
I seen the states and played the dates in the far-far
Gathered the new, from the zoas around
Grew up with Mikey Rodes and played the codes
Sometimes I don't budge, without my cous' Fuzz/fuzz
A simple, ""How ya do?"" Ah check it from my friends and my crew
Makes it definitely special

Now there's no Shiny Happy People in the crew we play the rough
I got the huff, and puff, to blow the house low

I know an Enterprising brother, so report to the bridge
I bounce a ball with my left, a squid with my right
(Cause a squid is just a punk) Yo he deserved to lose the fight

Then I kettle it quick
I felt the heave in the jeave
Tap it in the basement
Diggin' my own understanding quick
Let me get the single out
Think mr. radio say the starlight
Is the same star bright
I'm thinkin' how a nine and a blunt is a switch
But turn out the lights and some will go bitch
It was one mc after one mc
Play the lamp post do the blow wit dynomite
Well it's okay and it's alright
Cause our birthday cake's external light
It'll all get graphic
People made of plastic
Look at the shine wit my 50 watt eye
But when I got the eye patch I hit the latch
I fame it to a name from denver up to maine
And lovin' deluxe
She won't catch me in no tux
Nah, man I won't honor the style

Shorty: isn't that posdnuos? oh, my
Dres: baby, what's wrong with me?

Funny funny how time flies
When you have some light on the face
Cause the focus is the fickle
'stead of fusin' I'm a use it
To the utilize the trickle caught the rush
But I play hush
While andres titus is the grabbin'
As a fan will put the hearts to mush
Lush dalea would hear the public beat
The same way for titus when he blacked the sheep
But as the knee went deep
To deeper off the charts
The album faded to black
That's when the amnesia starts

Shorty: aren't you dres from black sheep? 
What are you doing here? who
Are you here with?

Hey boy, I watch that star man, shit's all in

I saw bootleggas no shinin'

A typical flick was the moment
When the man said
""Ain't you?"" yeah I is 'im
Hush your mouth fallin' in cog
Caught the light being true dog
A fist of funk and I pocket that screen
In the scene or in between
Gimme but a little bit of the starlight
I mail my ass to the darkness
I dig it, I dug it
I dig it, I dug it
I wiz it, I was it

So let me serve with the slope, with the Plug of two scoops!

Bootleggers my legs and, grit about a hug 
And who gets the Motts, I knots by the chance 
I rain-dance I rain-dance 
But steppin just a bit I don't need another shadow 
Makes makes, is gonna be the new man's motto 
Don't increase the bull, because my pulley is broken 
And my belly is full 
It's a second I reckon on the bone and the ball 
Makin London bridges fall, so check it 
I bring a point to the joints that we change and chop 
But we could bring it back to the beatbox!

Chill with latex cause of how I, enter

Saw the light cause I got glasses, so we 
Sip the cappuccino slowly 

I'sah makes the big money! 
I drive big 

Cars, serve the bubble like a bar tender 
When in flight like a sender, lace 
Sticks of dynamite on bass, head 

Lace the shoe until he dead 

Run! Cause the cop is gonna come 
This my Plug style 

So they can kiss my, grits 
Hold my balls without a mitt grab 
The mouthpiece to talk the dag nabit 
I keeps goin like that rabbit, ricochet a dame I need a Snicker, 
Satisfy the Norman to the Gladys, Knight 
My glasses help me see the light, so we 
Sip the cappuccino slow

That's a fumble
Well catch a fever from the jungle
Chocolate, nubian girls flock to it, sweets 
And if I can't sample beats, get the 
Beatbox equipped with the, dirt 
BizMark and Doug E. works, fine 
Mase work the wheel I tangle lines, hark
The light is thirsty in the dark 
So we 

It's like I saw it in the river but my M wasn't fixed 
Super heavy like a Chevy pump a Maseo mix 
I had some screams in my pockets, and played it kinda hush 
And did the outs (got to check out, the avenue) 
I peeped the Zoah on the gimme gimme, plus we hit the plat' 
Then the amps was on samp's, the villains got fat 
The Natives weren't the neighbor then to, nigga please
It's a hustle for a joint when your settlement G's 
But we still be on the wax because it acts like that 
We still be on the moves because it moves like that 
So there ain't no reason to don't stop

Mummy I saw one day
She was on some fume vapors
Givin' me lip so I continued with the caper
Cat litter had me sniffin
Since outside the palace
Eyes sicker than aids
Game harder than a callous
Tried to enter in her shit
She had locks on the session
Tellin me how her last man
Taught her ass a lesson damn
Well, I'm not the mayor
I take care of my dimes
But I excluded I had nickels
Addin' up to her kind
Short stacks with a wristful of jewels

Sayin she didn't need a man
To make her out for a fool
Dig it, miss, my love is credited in cupid account
And if you need that extra help
Gigglin, figurin' I had jokes for her humor
Then she broke out with the words
About knowin all the rumors
""See, all you niggas rappin be like pedigree dogs
Thinkin you can have me leashed
Around your microphone cords""
Somethin 'bout her lit me up like july
And with them onions in the pants
I couldn't help but cry
Seemed lost in the essence
But i had to find my way to take
Action for the digits just to set up a date
Thought my shinin was on
I had the skirts in the bag
Until i took a bit of time
To peep the price on the tag
She said ""I'm that salt and pepa
Who like pushin it to sisters
You need to get to walkin with it mister

She was a ghetto philosopher

Caught me lookin', ""Yo what's cookin?""
""Nothin' from around here
So don't approach or hope
To be the man of the year""
I said listen deer or rabbit or whatever the hell you be
I'm not the one to embarrass
But the one to emcee
I traveled the world q uarters on my relationships
Used and abused by hoes
So my royalty stubs
But above all
I brought my daughter into this earth
So I understand the need
Of women feeling of worth
She glanced deep in my eyes
And said ""oh shit, you're ill
I like the way your mind
Moves around at will
Still, let me apologize for soundin so sassy
But you niggas act as if my ass
Has a sign that says harass me""
Her name was gail from the union of dale
I made her remove the shades
So her eyes could tell me the plan
Yo where's your man?
""Oh that nigga's past tense
Painted bruises on my face
Haven't seen him ever since""
Gave a pinch to my bottom
And started rubbing my back
She said ""i bet your ass is darker
Than a mobb deep track""
Only one way to know it
And i was down to show it
So we jetted back to my crib to set it
She made it known
""I've owned thoughts of you
Since that song 'meeny-meeny'
Can't believe you're about
To be all up in between me""
Man, the flag was lowered
So my wood was raised
Followed a shielding of my building
To protect me from the blaze
This granted access to
Southern parts of her borders
Did you have her comin'?
Like the new world order
I caught her with the right combination
A good combination
Keepin' it in her hard, man

This is the body mos def style fresh like baby breath

We are the killer combination with the size to administer
The beatdown to swell up all three of your eyes

Now check it out, and ya don't stop
We got the big brother beat, ya don't stop

Now check it out, and ya don't stop
We got the big brother beat, ya don't stop

I don't bug out I chill, don't be actin ill
No trick in ninety-six, native tongue gon build
But we be easy on the cut, no mistakes allowed
'Cause to me, mc mean, make it clean
When I speak on groups and I'm smooth like gabba d
Tryin to hang out with dove and catch love in aberdine (word up)
I bag dimes like my man born on august 17
Life be nuttin but a river son I'm swimmin upstream

Playin wait up, with the data servin your ears
With information due to confirmation of the nation's most
Wicked ways of livin, like them glassy eyed beans
Inhale to smoke the fiends, while bangin a table
Rated at the high point of the mass
Rippin mc's at the top of a class, occasionally
Rippin some sucker's face
Or some suckable ass from a girl
It's a big brother beat for the wide wide world

I'm makin memos off these demos back in eighty-nine
Took you all on encounters of an unknown kind (right)
Did the hustle with a couple of us, but soon noted
That my niggaz buttered benedict rolls, and then voted
I wrote in the dark so I could feel it like braille (uh-huh)
Heard the big brother beat, got locked with no bail
Came to set like equators invented, with the heat
Yo mos def how you radiate to make it complete

Right, so when I shine the light crabs wince
Manifestin for the future here in the present tense
No doubt, I love the sound biggin out off your jeeps
Son I want the little kids bangin big brother beats

Now check it out, and ya don't stop
We got the big brother beat, ya don't stop 

Now check it out, and ya don't stop
We got the big brother beat, ya don't stop

I speak divine of God theories, no need to be high 
Always exhale the facts cause I don't inhale lye/lie 
Play the greater man's game, to bounce off my losses 
So I can earn the acres (uhh) the houses (yeah) the horses (huh) 
Of course it's much greater than your Benx or your Lex 
The engine to my comprehension is just too complex 
Much too complex, EFX/effects be live like Das 
Making moves down South, to avoid the chaos 
And never, flaunt the coin 'cause dime-getters be gazin 
They call me Luther Van, they say my style is so Amazin 
I'm fazin those who're supposed to have the last laughter 
'Cause even when I'm gone I'm reappearin in the after

In fact I get more hoes than Tessa, peep game like a 
Refa-ree in soul control of my

Whip ANYBODY ass at NBA Live, rappers 
Take a dive like Greg Lougainis with his bitch-ass 
Rather be in Bebe's alley, than at the click with gators 
Not a hater of the players, I'm more like a coach, or an owner 
I Used To Love H.E.R., but now I bone her (ahuh-hah!) 
At one point in rhyme I thought I lost my erection 
But then I got it back with the Resurrection, blessings

Droppin more knowledge than litter, on the New York peeve

While others explore to make it hardcore 
I make it hard for, wack MC's to even step inside the door

The lyrical killing, with stained egos on the ceiling

Over music plates, being played as the rule 
Kids thinking stepping to the Soul, you're labelled fools 
Who claims to drop jewels but for now you do the catching 
I don't worry on what crew you run, or what section of earth 
You reside, you're not even a man 
So I don't seem it mandatory taking your pride 
But I will, cause my man said Soul for the life 
You cried ""Keepin it real"", yet you should try keepin it right 
That's understanding microphone mathematics 
Which leaves the currency in temporary world status 
And when one shows he posed threat to this one 
This one will make that one into none 
Simple equation, zero, you shouldn't play hero 
If you can't stand Strong like the Island I'm from

Let me tell you a little something about Soul (tell em son) 
I be a piece of the East coast, so give a toast to 
Plug Wonder why back in the day who soaked his words in jigga 
So when I ran a phrase in June you didn't catch it til December 
I'm a member of them kids from the inner city 
Giving you kitties audible treats, you be aching for making 
More money than a pagan holiday 
Not from the PJ's, yet I still got something to say",The Bizness
De La Soul,"There's a lot of people out here 
Who just don't know 
What plays a factor 
In movin' heads and toes 

It be them hits 
Hangin' out of them stereo kits 
Whether cassette radio or cd bits 
Mix tapes from the best 

Going on and on 
Throughout the city grounds 
To suburban lawns 
Man  we don't play 

Even where we stay 
Videos shows the visuals 
Of jams today 
Coinciding with the rhythm 

Of the heart and neck 
The brakes got you 
In your proper context 
You let your lex or your 

Sixty-four suspension 
Bounce away all your tension 
En route to the club 
Where girls need the quenchin' 

Diamonds on your wrist 
Sunroof top 
But niggas out front 
Makin' guns go pop 

So the spot gets shut 
But on to the next 
'Cause your ears get vexed 
When they don't get the fix cause

It be your listenin pleasure 
While you're doin your chores

No matter where you from 
It's for you and yours 
[These are the brakes] 
Bringing it back to the brakes 

Like the 'yes yes y'all' 
(These are the brakes) 
So let it be your anthem 
When you're havin' a ball 

Well it's silly of me 
To think that I 
Would never get a chance to see 
A piece of this pie 

I sat dead in front of speakers 
Thinkin' that could be me 
Anticipatin' open microphones 
So I could emcee 

Had a catalogue of raps 
Impressin' all the 'round-the-wayers 
Before I went to bed 
Included rhymes into my prayers 
But that rhyme is all on paper 

I want my song on vinyl plates 
I dreamin' hits and doin' shows 
Makin my niggas spines shake 
Expectin' nuttin but a little bit 

Of radio play 
Gettin diced on 1 and 2's 
By the best djs, hey 
Time was kinda tight 

But still i dotted on the line 
And some expected me 
To start buhlooning in the mind 
Seein' spaces and places 
That i couldn't pronounce 
But still i had the pulleys 
To make all the bullies bounce 
With the blessings of the great 

We took it from state to state 
'Cause we landed on the good foot 
And got our biggest brake cause 
(These are the brakes) 

A mother gets mugged 
By her crackhead son 
""That's the brakes, that's the brakes"" 
You're in the wrong part of town 

So the shots make you run 
""That's the brakes, that's the brakes"" 
Your best comrades put six tabs 
In your o.e. 

""That's the brakes, that's the brakes"" 
Your boyfriend made you a carrier of HIV 
""That's the brakes, that's the brakes"" 
Now what's gonna happen 

When the sun don't shine 
I'm buyin tickets aboard 
The caravan of love 
Hey fellas 

See, money don't make shots repel 
I break woes and compose 
Some rhymes to tell 
So when the party's live 

It shouldn't be beef 
Or playin' indian roles 
I guess you thought you was chief 
Seems all broke up 

And now you woke up surprised 
Situation's gettin sticky 
Dead in front of your eyes 
We play the wall 

Similar to tacks 
Until the dj plays 
The necessary track 
In fact as the jam plays on 

Out comes all your bread 
To pay for drinks 
For them girls you want to spread 
Don't be mislead 

When the brakes inside your head 
And have you reminiscing 
On them kids who got you fed 
Until reality reveals a miss 

Who wants to know 
If you can play her real close 
Out on the dance floor 'cause 
(These are the brakes) 

It be your listenin pleasure 
While you're doin your chores 
(These are the brakes) 
No matter where you from 

It's for you and yours

Ringin it back to the brakes 
Like the 'yes yes y'all'

Schoolly D like family reunions, midday may, it's all lovin'
Take a walk down to d dot c, the war's tuggin'
And ain't no druggin', my credit's a gain
While you searchin for some trick to put the shit in her name
I be spendin' on wall Street and buyin' boardwalk
Dodging problems of the world drawn out in white chalk
Peace, Mr. Walt, I'm seein' all dimensions
But unlike your eye extensions, my vision don't blur
'What' 'when' and 'word's where the gossip occur
Heard I'm sexin' sade and I bought her a fur
Battin' eyes at Toni Braxton and I bought her a fur
Now I'm hittin' Whitney Houston, oh, she bought me a fur?
Far-fetched like glass teks and kiddie rolex

I'm pourin' out these rhymes for them kids who ain't here
Stakes is high, but we gonna try to have fun this year
Before there were guns, there was Native Tongues on these plains
Putting others on without them being pawns in this game
Cause a pawn in this game is left with no game to play
So, um, you best ta check and hear what we got to say
Now if you came to party, just let it be known
Now if you came to fight, you might get that head flown
By the one and only Maseo plug third
J.D. dove plays the wall as Kenny Cal spurts words
And a number to a crew of dope girls from the woods
And not dope meaning weed, but dope meaning (good)
Like them West Coast kids, who be throwin' up signs
I hate a buster, unless his name is Busta Rhymes
So check the way my mind moves over times and grooves
Got some money to blow, wonder why I wanna know

Through the L.I. Sound, to the villa down under
And across the globe I heard a lot of folks wonderin'
So when's it coming cause the stakes is high see big money that waves
Don't put the pen to my page
And ain't nothin' wrong with standing still and relaxing
And spendin' some of that cash that Uncle Sam is gonna tax
A New York demeanor, sit back in the beamer
With nothing to lose but some gas and some minutes
Ignorin' the gazers cause some stars don't get petty
And that trash you talk is just New Years confetti
It's like that y'all, but that's all 'bout to change
Like some of my own, people tend to act strange
I'm making a scene, and it's served with it's capabilities
So set it at an island's degrees

It's strong island for real, the diagnosis is supreme
The prefix is 516, where microphones fiend
The voices that gots the gift, cause the world is on their shoulders
Makein' plans to switch from little rock to money boulders

My girl stands deep from nubians actin' like Columbians sellin' keys
Characters have the tendency to con themselves
To think the East Coast is only New York and Philadelph
You know the way we blow, your shit is played like pork
And as for what we be bringin' you, we live and direct from New York
I ougtta say my fam calls me Merce
Steppin' to me fool will get you punched out like a curse
It's like that y'all, let it all consume
Like them brothas who smoke, 'till they high like the moon
Soon to a town near you be them super emcees
Settin' them Long Island degrees

I hit the L.I.R.R. for big dreamers out east
And get your bank roll split
Bangin' dents out your systems
Sellin' points to get the uppercut like Sonny Liston
But eyes closed episodes
Bring you back to zeroes
The same herp playin' like he Casablanca
Blind to it, but I'm a grind him up a cup of Sanka
Servin' dimes loves on tennis courts and sorts
Laid back like grown folks sippin' tea for sport

I be sweepin' up the room with my lyrical broom
While others rhymes smell like plastic like some lunch room utensil
The official color for this planet is green
Which growns in pockets of them people willing to scheme
An't no expose, these facts are from the mouth
Profilin' through Island with that wind from down south
At last, be the world broad cast from the crew who gave you 3's
Magic on an island degrees

It's strong island for real where the critters smoke fritters
Night time excites time for the heavy hitters
Gang on hers cause in the mean time mine is home on date
Fluffin' pillows impatiently waitin' ain't no debatin'
'Bout to settle, check the level stakes is high as the sky
I got questions about your life if you so ready to die
We in the last quarter y'all, somebody's gonna cry
I think they need to set the clock before the time pass by

In the round one no nines my size can get swelly
Sensing danger I will play a ranger on my celly with my felly
We're wonderful like colorful flix
Provide a thread and needle every time the stages get ripped
I grip upon the pleasure sippin' the tea
On the island cause that island is the main artery
So uh, you better come and give respect for catch some of these

Takin' you to the sky's survival
I am your captain, enola

To invisions, to broaden your outer visions
To where you never been before
It's just a one night trip to love
Sun shinin' forever, and forever sun shines

Yo, leaving lasting impressions like cuts to flesh
Be that crew from the five one six point of view
With skills so tight, they the rhymes of a vagina
Them clits will turn into a diamond, the level of rhymin'
Pressure comes from lesser forms than me and my man
And we go back like life created from um, specks of sand
And there's money to be made cause cacaussians are paid
Only brothers who
Rhyme, seek bounce and catch balls
Plug 1, with them rhymes makin' your heart stall
Like them girls when you in they room when they man calls
It ain't nothin' but the thing wonder why can bring
As we come to the bring the pain everyone will sing

But please don't rush the stage
Cause even though them stakes are really high
We're really not here to race
We're just here to move your mind and soul
With perpetuated ease
It's just about the show until it's time to go
And get with the young ladies

I'm on travellin' to places that the eye can't see
But kinder, cause yo' strife don't mean a thing to me
Throwin' me criminal looks, y'all need to get in the books
And drop some water in your melon, 'stead of actin' like a felon
Aiyo son, who you tellin'? I'd make a mil if it was up to me
But since it ain't I teach my seed to bank hard
And than god, I smoke a substance of a different kind
Catch me trippin' on earth when I'm high off sunshine

Down right to dirt, wonder why makes it work
With access to talent like caucasians to yellow cabs
With an arab driver
I liven parties with marvelous confiction
Ain't no fricition when life claims them victims who be some dried up funds
Best believe that the life is strife
Cause the gun made a man outta pussys from around my way
Who usually wouldn't have a fuckin' thing to say
Last year's hard rocks are now petrified boulders
And l.i.'s finest is movin' yo' necks at shows
The anthem of ths guy has a place in yo' eye
So you can be blessed to see in 3d double-e",Sunshine

Even smoked from blunts which give eyes the reddish tint 
Could not prevent, you from seeing I'm the light 
But bring attention to my words like some ads in tights 
I heard you want to fight me, with your words on stage 
So Mase pulls that instrumental from the jam you made 
And as he starts cutting what you sold, I'll talk all over your tones 
As if my name was Pete Rock or Sean ""Puffy"" Combs 
Send your tattered ass home, with celly phones I roam 
With my fleet, here to make this rap game complete

Attack a hit to go beyond this age of rap counterfeits 
Out of the heavens August one seven  sixty nine 
Born I  wonder why with the thoughts to rhyme 
Til there was no longer thoughts to dream 
When an unpolished demo led to limos at the age of eighteen 
Accompanied by the screams, Plug One 
Shot up with fame like novacaine it made me numb 
So numb I wouldn't been able to feel 
Niggaz diggin in my pockets for my currency reels 
But still, I make girls brown eyes blue at will (until)

Oh shit, I guess that was all the fame I was alloted 
Wait a minite, new video, like a leopard I'm spotted

Heard the De La, said I'm back in style y'know? 
Heh...

You-you-you... you need to stop

[Chorus: ]
I declare that only live niggaz rap this year 
Jam's off the meter yo, this {shit} is hot 
There's always one... (one!)
Amateurs get hung with they own gold chains 
There it is!!
I declare that only live niggaz rap this year 

The average Mc sells terror
We nail terror up against the wall for target practice
Not one of your top five Mc?s
But I see clearly with ease you lack this
Coast to coast, we pop up on your scene like toast
Playin' host to your regiment
Who rally to boast, but now boast no more
They got floored by the sight of my ledger print
I came specifically, to fracture yo' ability
To grandstand anywhere next to me
This is the year, when the true better man
Keeps the cheddar and writes to his destiny (word!)
Timeless episodes of talent got me nominated
By the ones who hated me on spittin' tighter
Salute these supa emcees for bein' clever
And never use the weed as a ghost writer

[Chorus: ]

Contrary to popular truth, these youth are runnin' scared
So in one stare they gettin' strapped
Cash rules nuttin' from below the belt
The dick choose to melt asses where them dollars at? 
(where them dollars at? ) musta been bitten by a rabbit
Actin' silly like that
Your pop culture need a diaper change
I'm snatchin' the mic, like I'm lootin'
With a whole lot of shootin' while you're keepin' out of sniper range
Your aim's to please, my aim's to freeze
You dead center in your tracks with your hands high
Ain't no tricks, we set it to fire like Hendrix
All the hard rocks at liquor spots
All over the scene, makin' it messy
So we make a clean getaway to a better day
Can't say the same, for them cats who left the game
Cause they couldn't claim the better pay
This ain't no masquerade
So the mass parade of people need to stop frontin'
There's truly a few makin' them hits
While us, we got our mitts closed cause you on the field buntin'
Make it to third bass, but never reach home
The word is, your whereabouts is unknown
While we're that point of view, that you never really knew
With the stitch to keep the cut sewn (De La!)

[Chorus: ]

Rock a bye baby!! On the tree top!!
When the wind blows!! The cradle will rock!!

Yo, I stay cousin to this, introducing Mr. Dave Banner
Scannin proper with my sight muscle
This rap shit, is just my night hustle
My J-O's to stay fearin of my G-O-D
Whether what may, meet me at the front door
See the pressure got a nigga knockin shit off his desk
Cause of the stress I stack words make cats bruise they neck tissue
Stay pertinent to the issues
Cut your tag too close, display these verses tight, virtuals
sort of like we supposed to, pantyhose raps you run
Stay (?) like black folks some (?)
mostly fakin it, to make it
[Pos]
I play low-key til it's time for you to know me
Stir my lime with light, drink it down slowly
Holy shit! Now look what I get
A whole string of party people want to run in my mix
In my world they want to fit like melanin in a tit
Jam tight, they ain't my fam alright? They ain't my people
Them niggaz screamin fam til they rank measure equal
then vote, without leavin a note, and that was all she wrote
Arranged produced my slang's obtuse
but some distort, tellin stories like Mother-the-Goose
My true fam's (??) back since with Vince Mason
We'll draw on three, leave that body for the tracin
Ultimate high, like them drugs you be lacin
Coulda stood next to me, at the top of the key
but you had to play gutter, didn't want to climb
Now you find yourself talked about in my rhyme
[Dove]
While you fools claim corners, we gon' claim theories
why'all some stickball niggaz, we the World Series
Been here, just pleadin the same case
ever since we spaced about ""3 Feet""
Pinchin your ears, inchin for years
but you still stuck at the mezzanine and
we at the penthouse level with the same old rugs
same old tubs, same old tables and same faults
Same crew and the same old train of thought
Chorus: De La Soul
My guess you need to head West (who you foolin)
Thought we'd fall for your phonyness you're (only foolin)
yourself, thought you were down - it takes more than a smile
and a couple of pounds to be crew
Man you bound to get your tail caught (who you foolin)
Spreadin yourself thin see you're (only foolin)

You need to peep your whole circle out

Yo, since Jam Master Jay been rockin without a band
and that sister k.d. lang been sexin without a man
we brought our ultimate plan to birth
Put in work for this game, it's not a game to me
We've been furnished the props
Now we out to furnish properties we own
That's right (so) cats might know we ain't home
My throne's threatened by fiends, try to do dirt
Play Tony Randall - have that ass cleaned

Unveiled I see your exhibition, why'all need to cover that
Fatherless styles, why'all really need to mother that
Same expose, different page
but when you see me in it it's the same old Dave

Troopin in this path til the death won us over
So if life is a party begin, to understand

How you think you gon' get away? (who you foolin)
Changin faces on the regular you're (only foolin)

Ace ban rap, the place the wasteland

Bit why'all in my mouth, but you taste bland

Get smacked for the B.S. you been on
Storm bad weather/whether or not you stay scorned

For ten years I've baked shit like hot potato

Touched down the God put 7 to your Zippo

It's the one and only effect, that you catch from a cassette
Straight wig out the world and girls we straight dig out ya back
 
with letters spellin' out my name
All over your marquee, cause the spark is me
Currently we can be seen across your screen
Stayin' wide-eyed 'cause you niggaz tryin' to scheme

Welcome to the spot - I'm slaying with it
Chop it up and fit it inside your quart of rice
You speak ghetto falsetto on the mic device
Tryin' to give me third degree, you just a third of me

Couldn't be the shit if you were a turd of me
A man tight with my funds, crush like Ricky D
who quoted Vance Wright - no one can serve us!
My squad advance heights quite superb

Just kick off your shoes - jump on the jock
It's been a long time comin' this you NEED to cop!

It goes one (one) two (two) three (three) four (four)
Bounce so much I ricochet up off the floor (floor)
So raw shit the most raw you ever saw
Quarter after four, niggaz quick to bust the back door

Baby - open your blouse while I joust another nigga's spouse
Quick Jamaican dick style all in they house
I practice to be the all access, you see the fact is
my mouth dirty, so follow while I display the slackness

Yo, you see my slang talk straight from the slums
When I was young, moms put soap on my tongue, and yo-yo
Forever we gettin' this CHEDDAR with the quickness
While I cast the spell on these bitches, you can be my eyewitness

Short fuse, nowadays Langston Hughes
We gettin' money with whoever - even the Jews
The way we finagle and gain it must be all in my shoes
Fuck a nigga up with De La like (?) can amuse

Yo, who hold guns and rock ice bigger than life
Got bitches throwing they drawers on stage, that ain't me!
I raise kids, push whips, piss an MC
Love money like I love my moms
Love my nigga Com Sense when he bang dents all up in they wallets
Wall to wall bullshit I got hardwood floors
Set sail for tour ever since eighty-nine
So why y'all are fucking the same hoes who used to be mine

[Tash]
And I've been waiting three summers to rhyme longside my people
Rico, De La, inject you with the lethal
Dose of hop-hipping if you thought CaTash was slipping
Then put that drink down, you drunk off what you sipping
CaTash put the dip in dip dive socialize
Fuck around with me and next you'll find yo' crib burglarized

[Xzibit]
Yo you better recognize and try to analyze this
Hand over fist, how can a man act like a bitch?
Change and switch, snitch on his crew
Yo get rid of the niggas before the same thing happen to you

[Pos]
And they'll leave your ass sticky like glue
Blood leaking out, girls freaking out, motherfucking cops tweaking out
Got you on your knees like a freak, juggling deez nuts
Smuggling these cuts from S.C., you best be-
Lieve there's no web or leave a net
We done swallowed 40 bottles of threat, yo

What you know about what's weak, what's tight?
And what you know about an off night? (uhh)
What you know about niggas fronting for the light?
And what you know about them gun fights? (gun fights)
Got a nigga ducking while them girls show fright
What you know about my writes? (my writes)
Ah what you know about my writes? (my writes)

[Xzibit]
Yeah, yeah, look
I'm Samson without Delilah, the soul survivor
The drunk driver that rolls straight, take the whole cake
Chop it up with the family, wash it down with alcohol
My telly's a Desert Eagle for all the fucking shots I called
My niggas gotta ball, never settle for less
Heavy metal, heavy on yo' chest like two breasts
Step into my office cause it's time for you to roll something
One false move, and we gon' beat you like you stole something

[Pos]
Yo these style I kick should be called ? rap
Drawing the pussy out the nigga after my prize, cause I want it
They stomach what I throw, they know I'm right for they diet
They librarian flow keeps the party real quiet 
The love I lost outweighs the rhymes I gain
But the fact that I spit 'em makes me cherish the name
So pass the mic so I can put in my share
I rip it from home to L.A.
With connecting flights to rip it elsewhere

Drinking up Black and Tan in the back of a van
 
I learned as a young man, long trip, piss in a can
Getting a house for two grand, now you got your own land
Let your mind expand, everyday have a plan
Ro-Gram is rare earth, swingin Black Tarzan
You got to live with the cards dealt in yo' hand
Stay young like Peter Pan, like Sly, take a Stand
And go Uptown Saturday Night like Ichiban

[Dove]
I keep it dirty like under the bed (dirty)
Dirty like Uncle Red, hey yo
Dirty brown Likwit flow thicker than the Yoo-Hoo
Dirt you dishing out, chef telling it all
Face down in the dirt, doing my dirty work
Expert, trying to regulate my network
Head jerk, spice it with rice, stick with it
If they ask who cut the grits I'ma say E-Swift did it

And I've been known to get it on, past the break of the dawn
Tash'll punch you in your grill and leave 'Potholes in Yo' Lawn'
(C'mon!) You making diss songs? Spit that rhyme my way
I can shut why y'all niggas down like the why-2-K
I did a tour in ninety-four with De La Soul and Tribe
We on the same vibe, cause real niggas coincide
(Right-right-right) The situation is drastic
But see songs like these is why this album going classic

[J-Ro]
This is for the DJ, bring it back one time
I drop bombs like when my moms told me to rhyme
I'm, old school like my dad is
So add this, to your collect', Plug Won, who the baddest?

[Pos]
Hey yo, we theme park status, upstage these niggas like Gladys
Them little Pips, they done tripped the wire
Blaming they legs, while I'm claiming these tunes
In this we'll stay down like seats found in sorority bathrooms

[Xzibit]
Yeah, we flat out classic, separate the real from the plastic
And I gotta say no names
Play no games, hit the switches, crack the frame
Show no shame or fuck it all up, take the blame
Brand name fresh out the box type hustle
Manpower success is mind over muscle
Grind til the wheels fall off, accept the loss
I never been soft, whatever the cost, addicted to floss
Nailed to the cross it's time to return
My only concern is making sure that Hollywood burn,
Hollywood burn, burn to the ground, trick-ass niggas
Is all up in the game and don't deserve to be down

[J-Ro]
Four bottle rap, twist the cap and kick back
De La, Xzibit and Tha Liks came to get that
And what you know about us dropping ya
And leaving you with half a face like the Phantom of the Opera?

And when it comes to rhymes (Brick City)

Yo, don't scandalize mine
I spent too much time
Straight talk with the catch to etch my line walk
Never fetchin for crime Halt! Who goes there?

Yo, it's the squeeze of five fingers, puffin Smokey the Bear
Shinin black like Darth Vader caps, they on stare

While we rockin it, I'll rock in it (rock in it)
Like the little ball inside the spray can
Providing three coats for both child, woman and man

God bless the God, lay these Streets Wall to Wall
It go ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Yo, you got popped like a flick by that rivalry clique
It went ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

It ain't my fault your ass is on the ashphalt
Got your chin touched by my fam who though you brought harm, you see
I'm iced out like a glass of tea
Better yet, oatmeal cookies, y'all just rookies to me
Slidin' up and down the court, but I don't think you can D
Why try? Maseo be gettin high since Luke was Luke Skywalk'
Man, my topic of talk is sheddin shame all over your game
Like them shorties who claim that afrocentric lovin is the past drug
A life filled with (*GUNS*) that's what thugs love
Snatch you fast, wrap that ass in the rug of your choice
While it muffles your voice

Now when I'm swimmin through the joint, I put the funk on hold
Cause if you don't, you'll see the bubbles come up
We run up a tab and gladly add a little extra for miss
Flashy faces with bigger lips for that ass to kiss

Most crews are post-current while we're forever
Direct beats that's contagious, loved by all ages
Graduated from the you-and-I-versity
Of hard-hitters, for real

I got niggas in the streets that'll blast your ass for the shine
And get ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Yo, if you a fat chick gettin your fuck on tonight
Then go ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Yo, put your hands opposite to the ground if you're lovin our sound
Go ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Yo, and to my broke niggas on the corner holdin me down
Go ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

Yo, I swear Tommy gonna get it, he done did me wrong
I had plans to buy more land, plant corn
Bust kernels on heat, work hard like wetbacks
Set backs is gonna get my ass to be hostile
Rockwilder the beat, top dollar defeat
Big money's make the big decisions
Keep hip-hop alive, it's just an intermission
Back to the second half of the feature flick
Dick stacks and fuck rap

I had a name for makin paper since paper mache
Now my dollar coins join pounds of yen for play
While you broke niggas reach drunk much quicker
You don't make enough bread to soak up all your liquor
Went from God to God damn

Damn God, you're killin it
Should incorporate it, invest half a mil' in it
Rap cats talk with no will in it

Soundin like they virtual
This joint'll hurt you, yo

Twas the night before Christmas and my crib got robbed
(shh shh shh, shh) They did a job
Took all my goodies out from under the tree, except the CD's
Of shiny suit rappers and flossin emcees
Who fail at takin it to rhyme degrees

Man, you know no wack poems get no play in our homes
You need to not get nappy with me
Or else we gon' ""relax your mind, let your conscious be free""

Yo, where my Wall Street niggas, if ya up in the stands
Go ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
To my women that'll throw they hands against they punk-ass man
Go ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Yo, if you never been shot or stabbed
Brick City go ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Yo, I gotta catch a cab back to the lab so I can smoke
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!",Oooh.

I was sittin on my lunchbreak, grittin my teeth
It's the last day of the week, man what a relief
My arms are sore as hell, I felt rigid and stiff
so I turned around and I rolled this big fat spliff
That's when I seen her, steppin out a rented yellow Beemer
This local ghetto fame rap cat her name was Tina
She was braggin she was goin on tour
The same shit she was screamin since the year before
Ever since the De La Soul video, she seen me on the TV
Heard that she was holdin a grudge and tryin to see me
Workin underground circuits and mad cyphers of people
When she asked who was ill, all she got was Indeed
She want to battle (what?) and it wasn't hard to tell
All that I was thinkin bout was tryin to smoke my L
I had four hours left and I was tired as hell
Plus it was 12:55 almost time for the bell
She had an ill screwface mug, frontin like she know Joe
Gangsta bitch profile, boppin like allegro
Forty-below Timbos, fatigues saggin
Pullin all her money out her pocket while she's braggin
on her gold fronts with her name on it
Her ice finger roll hand g-low while she claim fame on it
I peeped the stee' - then I crushed her with ease
just for interruptin me while I was rollin my trees

AIGHT? (Whoo!)
That shit was bla-bla-bla, bla-blaze! (word)
Now we gon' se-se-set, se-set this one up
for my man Mercenary (aight aight yo let's do this)
(whassup?) Yo, I don't want you to make it like
a story or nuttin (aight)
I just want-want, want want-want
want you to come on some straight rhy-rhy-rhyme
rhy-rhy, rhy-rhme shit - rip a nigga in his ass!
And let him know how WE do it, why-why-why'know?

Now Maseo puff cheeba, while Rich sniff lines
David J push the whip while Candy Cal pull dimes
And me right behind, with the shorty gettin her math

Still the one who kill wackness, man I left them niggaz crippled
Had em all soft to hard back to soft like a nipple
My +Art is Official+ while you're art-ificial
Break you down to your very last participle
Let me enlighten you, cause your third eye's on dim
Me gettin taken out is rare like a smile from Rakim
See I'm remarkable, you're just bull
last name shit, why'all niggaz need to quit
Open your mitt, and catch this
I autograph every word you bit
??Testify then?? take your picture
Got an infinity of non-rhymes to hit ya
while your whole clan is blam
Understand that you must be smokin POUNDS of weed out of a pipe
and mistook your munchies, for bein hungry for the mic
And now you have to deal with these cats who's truly right
like estates with a pit on the lawn bark at the gates
Put the whole entire plate in your face
Make the point like who's that on that joint? It's me
I'm in everything you see like ??, yo I'm in demand
I'm in the club man I'm in your hand
bein bought, I'm even in the thought from your girl
The only thing you're in is in acting
Your world'll be smashed
Run against the Won and you'll be last
like that call for alcohol, depletin your cash

Just one more time, from 'Stix N Stonz'

It's the M I K E, ohh, to the D
I'm comin' exquisite and V.I.P.
Tryin' to spread some love like roots on a tree
Stayin' true to this vision in the Y2G

Two G's got 'em scratchin' it like the fleas
And Ad Rock got it locked like a crooked cop
Now, it's Ad Rock, y'all remember me
The guy ya bit ya style from off the TV

I score Mmmma-Zah-Ayy's all day
My essays are felt worldwide
We like four planets on the mic
Aligned arrays retired all in the days
Game, too blam for these lames
(Baby, baby)

When I was nine, I played with slime
Got rhymes ga-lot, got rhymes ga-limes
I got a million like rhymes leavin' ya stung
I got my own crew called the nasal tongue

Yo take a few of these be-boys and call me in the mornin'
(Okay)
Keep it on the crusty eye, bagel with some butterflies
Spit gritty like we in MCA's voice box
Y'all bull and my ox don't fit the mix

(Disc jock)
It be some classic material kid
(Disc jock)
Got the calm cats blowin' their lid
(Disc jock)
You get plush off the rack

And buy plenty or more we got em by the stack

For all the fly fellas and all the fly girls

Come on Squat, come on Squat
Come on Squat, come on Squat
Come on Squat, come on Squat

Now we'd like to introduce to you, Ad Rock

Ad Rock in the house you don't stop
It's the be E A S T I E be O why S with the most finesse
Don't mean to be crude, don't mean to be crass
But listen Guiliani you can kiss my ass
(What?)
You heard my word, now Dove you play the preacher
Get on the mic if you love all the creatures

Well yeah, I got these fishes swimmin' 'round my baracuda
Back in '82 I used to ride a street scooter
Called 'em cuter than pigtails, sales you keep 'em level
And smack you with a shovel and break your lifestyle
(Oww)

Firm on the mic since my days of a child
Got a 'License Too Ill' to flash to police
The only beast I huddles with the Beastie Boys
Bringin' 'Noise' like P.E. to your TV

Aiyyo, this beat's barefoot and knock-kneed
Stripped to the rhyme
And every line made from scratch
Attached like stripes to shell-toes
Thin spools that hold the herb
Mike what's the word?
(Word)

It's like the ooh-la-la, ooh-ooh-la-la
Rhymin' over old breaks like the Mardis Gras
Party people cross and bump they go, ooh, and they, ahh
And Mike D and Ad Rock down with the De La

Put ya body in it

Come on Squat, come on Squat
Come on Squat, come on Squat
Come on Squat, come on Squat
Come on Squat, come on Squat

I'm feelin' good, damn good but also confused
This stuff from hip-hop that's bein' misused
It's desirin', acquirin', tryin' to be like Iverson
If it means backstabbin' and also conspirin'

Now, the people in the front, you do the bump, bump
The people in the back, they're not the whack, whack
The people in the middle, come on and wiggle, wiggle
And the people on the side, we can all take a ride

In my VW I done swung an ep' or two
The rear in my hatchback y'all know I scratched that
Here to haystack, keep it rosy in the Rolls
Skiddin' out to place my vote at the polls for Ad Rock

Well, I'm the the toe tapper, yes the hand clapper
From the middle school like the educated rapper
I'm known as an occupational MC
You think I lose sleep if you sleep on me?

It's the rock solid, pilot, here to fly
(Rock)
Reachin' elevations too far for the eye
(Eye)
Miraculous beats over breaks in these packages
Seen and all the types
(All over the globe)

Who thinks our joints is aight, here's a swab for ya ear
(To clean out ya lobe)
And listen to a few views
From two crews spittin' for the art of it
We ain't takin' over but damn sure takin' part of it

Started it ever since we minced meat
You Sloppy Joe's went and took a bit of the corn dog
Stay there, I'ma play there

In the big old Santa Claus bag got discs and now we out

Signin' off, signin' off, our work is done

I ain't no thug son, my name is Plug Won
I drop a certified gem, for him and her
Knockin on your radio, like the Crash Crew
ask whoever you want - I'm managin the funk on the paper
Outside of that we pull capers for days
Ridin throughout the maze of street, while we blaze the beat
Watchin the sweet things wiggle they butt
to Plug Three, on the cut, movin on ya what-
-ever ya got, we gon' get, bringin our point, to ya position
Rippin stages with my thought coalition
Carryin on, eradicate all your stress mode
Just another episode through these area codes

It's the hot-ness, talked about but never seen
like the Loch-Ness, til ya cop this; drop it inside your vein, 
and like a train, we be runnin throughout your legs and arms
You're high off our talent and charm
Check the caliber - this be a smash
like some food on stage for Gallagher
Wear ya bib, cause it's messy
Niggaz schemin on my +Girl+ as if my name was +Jesse+
Watch your manners! Now let me pass it off to Dave Banner

Yo, I set travels like Karen LaRue
Small talkin in the big city, it's all about gettin the coins
Everywhere I go I touch a tenderloin
They sportin a dot com Viet marker bomb
on your metro - MARTA order iron horse
Yo take the cross and meet a nigga at the butcher
I'm cuttin your girl - we on a world tour
Supplyin your bloodstream with nothin but the pure uncut, in ya

We ain't walkin on a yellow brick road
These streets stay red and bloody kid
Study your code, so you can easily pass
I stash a little love when I'm on the visitation
If you crossin my lane, nigga do the same
I guaranteed to run through and prove the game
ain't bigger than the pieces in it
You see the pieces in it had me stuck travellin one side of map
Clappin hands with rap cats who ain't deserve dap
Long hauls and livin out a suitcase man
Chickenheads and gangs of fruitcakes man
Ain't nuttin better than explorin the outskirts
especially when she ain't got no pantyhose on, and it's on

[Dove]
It's been about ten long years, my skin wreaks
flavors that your incense couldn't match
We burn slow like syphillis in your piss, accommodated
with the penicillin, you're listenin', to

This ""Art Official"" will keep your shoes moonwalkin
Soon to talk about, ""Pop Music""
You'll buy it cause you choose it
A lot of MC's is really S&M'n

Whips and chains, I maintain like a old jazz singer
Elephants in any location
Held back in rotation, an apple a day
only makes a nigga fruity

I eat responsibilities to carry out my duty
[unknown] in the MD's, I pull it out just to polish it
Make notes if you earnin' or wait your turnbuckle
I stick to gettin' mines like stucco (ahhhh, ahhhh)

[Pos]
I'm that full-time rapper, the nickname's Llama
Part-time father if you ask my daughter's mommas
Missin' in action cause the action got a fraction
of the world listenin' to me

Got em travellin' overseas in lands constantly
Got a sea of hands wavin', ain't misbehavin'
but a lot of kids cravin' for somethin' they ain't got
Like the keys to the ride and a pocket with a knot and it's

Holdin' they ground 'til they rot in it
Plottin' it, lockin' it down strong
'Cause it's nuttin' wrong gettin' your bubblin' on sticker
But too much bubblin' can make you fizz quicker

So watch your stack, keep your fam intact
and pay attention to the now, I'm clearin' the mess
While they stressin' back in the day, I'm at the front of the night
with my crew shinin' light on the (ahhhh, ahhhh)

[Chorus: x2]

Now we on top of this like a typical bed position
Peepin' your view, got your whole crew wishin' and waitin'
Makin' dollars out of ten dime pieces
who be sippin out the glass suckin' on the lime pieces included

In my pieces I pen the good livin'
And even when we're stressin' from in the hood livin'
at least we're livin' and there ain't no hell in that
Give me a yell in that, and go (ahhhh, ahhhh)

[Dove]
I want to see the world ten times over
Dive off cliffs and land on oppotunities unthinkable
You sinkin straight to the bottom; while I float in parades
that St. Patty couldn't put up

All my niggaz tryin to build, then throw your wood up
Design life like PNB gears so stand clear for the blast off
Last off my chest, peace to Dav West
Live your life to the fullest (ahhhh, ahhhh)

We run it, Hot! When we over the drums
To the, Top! Cause the bottom we're from
We got the, Drop! On your weekend crew
'Cause you're full-time talkin' while we peepin' your view

Rahubat(?), you know my name
I run my humbleness with fame
God-body, nuttin' plain
While you claimin' shepherd that you heard this
You, heard this on day first
Watch my man, he'll make it worse
Ain't no new click, we still Native

Clothes knit, stitched tight, related
that's the way we handle it
Pin us up or mantle it
We on fire you candle lit
Daydreamin', on a rack
Get bought worn and brought back
We sport rhyme thought real tight

To gain sizes much bigger
Life life well, get mail filled with
Checks from sales we deliver

Spend a little, make a little
I want it big like white boy wallets
Credit delivered, Fed-Excellent
To my dot com, we on the web like Charlotte's
Hornet, back her up, she too much on it
Your plastic ass'll get swiped
Past the limit see you the type
To get yo' cosmetics smeared on pillows all night

[Chorus:]

While we peepin' your view
While we, peepin' your view
We got they eyes on lock
Let them flock to your wit while I spit after you

Look ma, I'm still rhymin'
Baby boy still providin'
Breakin' bread in four states
Makin' these struggles get gone
 
Private eyes, I see why'all spyin'
You watch while I clock
Fertilize my brain data
Makin' accounts grow green like the front lawns

Yo I may be old school
But I'm not no old fool
Heard out your mouth words flee
'Bout 'These niggaz ain't nice'
You just barbershop talkin'
While we round the world walkin'
be	, you ain't D.M.C.
You slip and fall on my ice
No lyin', straight shinin'
I give you supper from my upper diamond
You got limbs so climb in

Yo, soak up what you find-in
We too pure for you to try
You sniffin' maybe's and if's

And if 'if' was a spliff
Man we'd all be hiiigh-iiigh.. iiiggghhh..

.. But it's not, so sober up
You flashin' out like you paparaz'
You'll need to take a liver shot
To feel the heat on how we runnin' it, yo

[Chorus:]

'Cause you're full time talkin' while we, while we
While we lettin' you know I'm in a
Certified rhyme meadow for days
If you ask Mercenary bout this shit, it pays
Hitting Willie Mays style out the park
Mastering in this +Art+ that's +Official+
Your ears absorb this like tears, on a tissue
'Cause my thoughts are dollar bill crisp
Distinct like E-Double's lisp
L.I. alumni, wonder why I got it
Got it? Get a piece
Got product that you all should own and not lease
Some say drummers play synonymous with ill
With wordplay, that keep us all paid like a bill
We're the parent company
You the sub in my d-i-vision
You don't know how...",View

[Dove]
How you goin' tell me to mind my own biz
When you lookin like somethin I need to know about?
I used to go about it the wrong way, tuggin your arm when you'd pass
But I see you got class besides all that

Yeah I'm picky in my own way too
While the rest of these fools is lookin to screw your brains out
I blinged out don't(?) want to stand froze
Practicin my hello's, hey lady, how you doin

Renewin these vows is like fifty steps beyond from here
Shit I don't even know your name yet (word)
Ain't sure what your character contains yet
But damn lady, you could be my Valentine

Cupid got his infrared on my chest clocked
Let the rest flock, they just birds anyway
I grow my confidence in words the Henny way - yeah, buy me a drink
So we can sink into that thought path..

[Chorus]

Now you know you ain't right, eyein' me up all night
Despite the fact some kid is runnin' chitta-chat in your ear
How the hell we get here, with me over here, and you over there
When we can make, such an obvious pair?
Why miss? Have you misread my shyness for conceit?
I'm peepin' how you move it to the pace of the beat
 
Got my eyes on wide as they constantly collide with yours
Your heavenly body rushin' the tide to shore
Your heavenly body rushin' these guys to the floor
To find pleasure in your double digit design, 

But these clowns look hurt
And as a woman's ex-nigga I'm a woman ex-pert
Understandin' how the ovaries and all that shit work
Extremely dreamy, my eyes you look surprised

That I'm movin' closer - don't be, I'm supposed to D.C.
Are you for real or a tease?

[Dove]
Now let that drink set in sweet, we up close and personal
Ain't nuttin dull about this, sharp like Swiss precision
(Caught you watch-in) my every move from the door
Teran escortin us to V.I.P., we live in D.C.

Shoestring dress I want to fuck and make your hair look a mess
Suckin the straw huh? You know the head game
First place chick girl I'm all about winnin too
I want my trophy life-sized in a see through

This ain't your average, whippin your batterage
Drivin song that probably isn't your type

De La Soul,"Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
It's a pity that you're so dirty
Worthy of some Southern hos-pital
See we them Northern boys with nose and how's
NYC livin' ain't nothin' like it
See how me and my peeps fit, we jigsaw
Sometimes I play big saw to cut the deal
And we keepin' them bills paid with meals in the mouths of many
A noble job at Feni
Money ain't everything but everything makes me want it
But won't dishonor my name so the claim throwers
Act like game on the dice on the mic device
Stay above middle class for life
Not an easy task but I've grown to love it
Dub it to tape, why don't you whip a grin
While I speak to my mens about the world problems
And girl problems with no immediate way to solve em'
But I'm on hits

[Chorus]
I make the best of the life I be with it
Making the most of the moment among the livin'
And it feels good
Being the man that I want to be
Do what I can cause I refuse to see
The best of luxury, God's been good to me
Now I'm asking am I worthy of you, of you
Am I worthy of you

[Verse 2]
Pull them quarters down
I got some things on these nine ounces to vamp
Me on a mission why'all
Dug fresh dirt out the ground
Lookin' for the treasures in life
A bambino picket fence around the residence
I wore these shackels here for thirteen years
 
But the only real slaves is the ones we record on
We off all checks and God's blessin'
Tryin' to own a thousand island like we salad dressin'
Patience for the main course
Don't have me in position to remain boss
Cause the man next to the man above the exec
Don't give a damn if I papered yet
Sometimes it make me want to go make a bet
I did away with knock em' and release some stress
By any means, these petty greens will only get me stuck in a box
Doin' a dick shot in Oz, jerkin' off in the J
But anyway I keep my head on

[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
I know people who tippy-toe through they own stompin' ground
Master not makin' a sound to stay safe
From the local star renaissance
And the response is usually the same
Wishin' like it used to be
Nothin' in that life is new to me
We roll like eyes on a ghetto girl
Brushin' off some no-man cause she's his ghetto pearl
We into livin' beyond not livin' fads
Me and my comrads became dads young
Try to have fun amongst responsibility
Like fillin' these accounts full
Got caught up at a party in Bull's
Sometimes gotta have the nerve to say some rhymes
Because some minds take offense
Try to make ya life tense but we still here
Still gainin' the love, still standin' above most

Ladies and gentlemen, we in the trench again
Makin it relevant, just for the hell of it
I'm introducin it, throw a little juice in it
Got on that old bullshit to get you used to it
It's been a minute now, only a minute now
A little re-evaluatin, hope you feel me now
I'm on some new me, focused on the new tree
Tryin to shake the money off the limbs so I can do me
I blame the fans for it, I heard demands for it
Went to Somalia, they holdin out they hands for it
Went to the hood, these niggaz tried to trace a dance for it
Dancefloor it after Mase brings you out of the break

-- Before we go any further we want to send a special thanks
To all those folks out there that been supportin De La since '89

Overseas, city to city, state to state

Unlike these underground MC's who rock for heads
We include the throat chest arms and legs
No need to spit in the cypher to show you I'm a lifer for rap
I cultivate moves larger than that
And I don't ball too much, ya dig
I gotta ball and chain at my crib who want my ass home
My heart-BEAT N.Y.C. metronome
But can't adapt to where I'm at
And even though I sing it sick 'til I'm blue, I'm not a crip
So unlike non-GANG members I won't see-walk to look hip
But if I had to join a gang I think I'd join GangStarr
Me, Guru and Primo with them beats for the car
That bounce trampoline style, revamp the deen child
Hot and mild and I hustle rap the same
Cuff a little shit, due to muscle fat, I gain
We them God type dishin the grunge to make you love

-- Yeah kids
Just a little taste how we gon' get things started in a minute
Sit back, get your headphones straight

This is dedicated to all my folks
Diagnosed with a bad case of that proper upbringin'
And never took the time to fall in line or follow
Or swallow the thoughts

Of the recognized committees who lurk throughout ya cities
Ya hood, ya town, no matter which type
You from the same type of people try to hold you down
Just because you tailor made for bigger and better things

Never missed a chance to move ahead of things
And what does it bring? I tell you for me
It brought jealousy in back wounds from all the stabbin'
Cats posin' as my fan just to get grabbin' what's mine

I'm livin' in times where my daughters are found around
Kids who can't afford thinkin' caps
But always found drinkin' raps and eatin' off beats
Claimin' laws of the streets, but who made the laws?
Everybody playin' rebel with no sign of a cause

Well I feel the world around me
I've found that others will bring you down, just to be down
You've got to make up your mind, where you want to be
Where you want to go with your life
With your life

I'm never singin' the blues but findin' the clues to maintain
And I been blessed to reign supreme over nearly every dream
I had, and I made it come true
I'm an imperfect man and I'm holdin' the clue

To perfection, it doesn't seem to matter what direction I look
I find people settin' traps
Tryin' to find the goal, without havin' any maps
Even friends of mine, jumped online, just to become my adversary

They felt they were entitled to the dairy I made
They don't come to chill or behave
 
And they got, toast ready to burn
Not learnin' to live, but they yearnin' to take what you earn

Well I feel the world around me
I've found, that others will bring you down, just to be down
You see, you've got to make up your mind, where you want to be
And where you want to go with your life
With your life

So quick to place blame, and deny the shame we bring upon ourselves
So many names held accountable for my own account
When a large amount was weighed, that I made and shaped
When I climbed I found

It was hard to find others around to point my fingers at
Which made me realize the truth
The biggest suppressor could be your own ego lookin' for an excuse
To plant roots, in a field of self-sorrow

To sprout and follow the first thing you feel
Nourishes your hunger to be respected, it gets hectic
And when I'm watchin' the news, and my daughter walks in
And choose to ask, 'Why were all those people on the floor
Sleepin', covered in red?' I told her
That they were lookin' for God, but found religion instead

Well I feel the world around me
I've found that others will bring you down, just to be down
You see, you've got to make up yo' mind, where you want to be
And where you want to go with yo' life
With your life, with your life

Oh, bring you down
Sometimes, you got to walk alone, alone
Oh, yeah, I need, ooh, to breathe
I need my space, to live
Y'all know, y'all know, oh

Well I, feel the world around me
I've found that others will bring you down just to be down
You see, you've got to make up yo' mind, where you want to be
And where you want to go with yo' life
With your life, with your life",Held Down

Grabbin' tissues, like you didn't know you had it in you

I live it up y'all, givin' you what y'all
Need and can't call, carry the ball
Like a spit-kicker should and ya wish ya could
Hold it down like the digital who stitched the hood
Better yet the whole globe, light it up like a strobe
While you froze panicin'
Went from man to maniquin
We them peaceful rap stars
That can still jab ya in ya face
Leave ya shit redder than Mars

The sauce and shit, of course we it
The flossy shit
Groundin' beef like Maxwell House
Go ask the house
We representatives
Go call ya Senators
Change laws in rap, renovate ya landscape

And pull a paragraph up out the tango

Hey, yo, The sky swallowed the sun
spitted out the moon and stars
Puttin' out shiners that gave the cause
ArmorAll-ed down, the downtown activity
I'm bout to have fun without the problems that live with me
Not tryin' to be posh, but lets stay out the mosh pit
Tonight keep my nose out of trouble
Everybody in my bubble's been breifed:
NO BEEF, JUST PARTY!
Of course your gonna have some clown niggaz try to
take us off course
Always lower levels tryin' to bring out the devil in us
Not condoned but its known
That a party ain't a party if the thugs don't try to shut it down!
Tight security and its still soft
Can't offset the thirty or plus caught in the rush
Keep the door sealed
Cause the floor's filled with action and we don't need
any distractions tonight ya'll.

Sweat it out, get it out

You gave ya all and I just gave it up
Put the truck in ya name
Damn ya should've known I was liability
Ignorin' the ways you would dress for a nigga
Express to a nigga I heard jibber and jabber
My apologies I left the wrong man to conduct
Take these jewels for the inconvience and neglect
You expect the worst of it
But I realize that I owe you more than explanation
 
I got my life in a box, what I'm supposin' is a joint account
It's cash on it, let's take our lil' business and incorporate it
It's me and you girl

First of all love, your soul caller
Before me helped create and shape your distorted image
See every man don't play or even scrimmage
That's a lie but I'm try to be that only one
You look to, to make you smile
First you need to check my files
Understand I play the partners stereotypical man
An regret the pain I may have left to flame
My people say 'Yo that's a fine girl ya mess with'
But I told em' we havin' a mess
Ya charm must have calluses from the grip
That it has on my heart that I ain't tryin' to rip
But by now we both should know
That it's no longer where ya at but where we tryin' to go
So do ya background checks so I can pass through these borders
And stamp my name on a lil' man or a daughter
Come on girl

We for shack ship, you know laugh it off
Years just blow by
My eyes stay fixed but the picture's kinda outta focus
I cry a lot but admit to it
Enjoyin life now but I've been through it
Sometimes I wish that I can go back
No bills no kids just getting tore back
I want a wife, I love women
How could I front like I don't be in love wit em?
A li'l man that I can teach
A li'l sand but not the beach
I figure excess'll only bring an excessive amount of fussin
So when I'm gone, make sure the head stone reads, 'He did it for us'
I'm like your modern day Jesus
I cherish warm thoughts like a gray goose
And float soft kisses to my baby
(yo ain't that Dave's little girl?)
Yeah, respect her for that
She gon be somebody
Instead of somebody-baby-mama
You see young minds are now made of armor
I'm tryin to pop a hole in your Yankee cap
Absorb me
The skies over your head ain't safe no more
And Hip Hop ain't your own
And if it is then you fuckin up the crib son
You make life look like I don't want to live one
You might as well hold your breath until you die in a
Corner somewhere bent over in the crevice
This God Theory overcomes the worst of weathers
As long as you willin to try, you on a good start homie

Throughout my change to grow, Some of my people got left behind
They didn't listen for the gun, as I leaped from off the line
Thirteen years deep in this marathon I'm runnin
Paid dues and still got bills to pay
When I came back around the way
Old friends gave me dead eyes
And fake smiles, half wide
We were supposed to rid the world of danger
These days we nod heads and small talk like polite strangers
It's natural to fall off, just land close to the tree
I'll be there if they need me to be
And I know all my local shorties
'cause they all know who I am
And latey want to flip grammar instead of grams 
Like that's the only choice they got
They tell me how they gonna shake up the game
But came to me to see if I could give em guidance for change
Shit why'all, I need guidance myself
And I chisel right words to make gems
Got fans around the world, but my girl's no one of em
And my relationship's a big question
'cause my career's a clear hindrance to her progression
Said she needs a man and our kids need a father
I'm not at all ready to hear her say don't bother
And break
And this I know I can't take
But uhh
C. Smith said to hold on
My brother Luck said to hold on
My nigga Dave said to hold on

Do you want to lose hate for love?

Do you want to see these gates above?
Yes!

I said people are you ready?
Yes we're ready!

But are you willing to try?
We want to try harder!

Do you really want to carry some weight?
Yes!

Are you ready to design your fate?

Come on, genuine adrenaline from off the wrists
We run the interference throughout the game clout
Can't be denied the bout for the title
Throw up ya guns and hold the pose like an idol
Bring it back to the draw

You ain't lyin, I

Can't get the thought off (sex)
From off my mental shelf

[Slick Rick]
I'm like Bruce Lee
Beatin up the cootchie profusely
My tomboy chicks that act a little to butchy
receive this (uh)
When my semen ceases
They'll be screamin out, ""We love bein the female species""

Hello?
Veronica, it's Dove.
Uh, I think you got the wrong number
What?
Veronica, your baby's crying.
Yo, chill
Baby?
Whatever yo, later.

[Dove]
For the past two summers I been sizin up Veronica
Southern belle, I heard she blow notes like a harmonica
Yamacas couldn't satisfy her spendin fetishes
She was all about gettin the head like she was lettuces

[Posdnuos]
Yah, them types be actin like they ain't sleazy

[Slick Rick]
Like this uptown chick playin opposite of easy
Delighted, the honey fly difficult, couldn't knife it
Tiiight
Seen the imprint on honey's private
Now she's love sick
Ruler Rick scoress agaaaaain

[Posdnuos]
Sex present itself like trophies I'm out to win
And it's easier to claim with the fame I've obtained
Her mommy was a liar, she's so ashamed

[Chorus]
[Slick Rick]
Well, I got this rude boy Jamaican honey at the rest home
Complete with yellow hair and Cinderella dress on
Whatever
Been around, stuck her till she poppin bout
""Hey take your blood clot finger off me bottom""
Anyway, another dime I met one time
I'm kiiind, chick in the world, butt fine
And her, structure pumpin, told her
Gotcha mumblin bout
""Slow down, what you tryin to rupture somethin?""

[Posdnuos]
I don't bug out, I chill
Never copped a feel
But these pretty ass girls come and flaunt in the grill
Big ass eyes, with the matchin big ass thighs
Asked her if she spare a moment to exchange some lies
""But you got a girlfriend""

[Slick Rick]
Yah trick, so do you
And I heard there's no preference in what gender ya do

[Posdnuos]
So stop playin so squeaky clean
And let the dirty side see me later
So we can play 'away from the navy'

[Dove]
So stuck on the love you rearranging behaviors
Second episode, and you returnin oral favors
Buyin up groceries
Searchin for hosiery
Holdin hands publicy
And now you supposed to be
Mr. and Mrs. huh, lovin and kisses huh?
But while you away is when the milkman'll visit her
Dear to the heart, we dearly depart the fallen
So skip the games ma, I stay tuned to the calling

[Chorus x 3]",What We Do (For Love)
De La Soul,"Jody got a cat but she won't let it out
Oh, tough luck, 'cause it makes Jack pout
Waiting on the wins he moves to the next
Searching for the cheese, looking for the text

In the Big Blue, in search of the skins
Grinning and laughing, laughing and grinning
Padlock Jody got the whole scene played
No knockin' boots till she's 14K'd

Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Waiting for the credit card so she can go and shop
Jack plays the back, just knockin' other socks
'Cause now in the hood he's 'Johnny The Fox'

Till one ring came, Jody blew a spark
Found about Jody round the corner in the park
Flipping like a dipstick, hip to the news
Practicing the range, bellowing the blues

Jack rolls the carpet in, swift like a skate
Yo, Jody, yo, gotta go, got a date
Padlock Jody's screaming, ""Wait, wait, wait""
""Don't worry, hon,"" he replies, ""I'm keepin' the faith""

I'll never do the baseball with you again
Yo, I'll never do the baseball with you
'Cause your hoochie-coo was so smooth
Was it such a sin to let, let me in?

Hooked by your ever-so-shyness
Want that bush, heard you're from Flatbush
Ran after ya, caught ya
Brought ya to Long Island, stylin' for a while

In my hut, I was on a cut for a peck, a silly Greg Peck
You tried to play me new, Plug One you disconnect
I'd try to touch your hair, you would say no
Yo, I'd try to touch your hair, you would say no

Is it 'cause you want my financial flaunt?
First you gotta please me, nice and easy
But I guess you want that in reverse
So I stand Plug First can see

We got a serious block
Turn the other way, ooh, what do I spot?
A hoopin' Hey Love whose scent left a trace
Had a stash in her pocket with a body that's safe

Ball to the eight, now you wanna swing?
Forget the rap, yo, Black Sheep, sing

You're banned, you're banned
You're banned, honey dip, you're banned
You're banned, you're banned

Ya banned by the preacher man
You played yourself a stew
Now to me you step, never mind love
The faith is being kept

Now remember 'bout Padlock Jody, here's the fact
Jack little wick but she was acting wack
Jack wanna lay but laying ain't exact
For the past four or five she was banned by the pack

Hip to the witness, putting on a plan
No money, no more Puddy Tat for the man
Jack knows that honey means playing a game
Only wanna bowl, got nabbed for the fame, goddamn

Sam was the man that you planned to command
Nothing new about a neighborhood
You know what? Padlock Jody wanna cut
Jack's thinking cap, make mine into a pack

Yo, here's twenty, forty, sixty, pay me back
Conscience appears, ""Yo Jack, what you doing?""
You play the cold while honey here's cooling?
You don't have to if you don't want to
You don't have to if you don't want to""

So he begins with the ring, ring, ring
""Hey, Judy girl, how ya doin'
Seen you with another man, what you doing, screwing?
Ooh, shame on you, what, you can't wait
For the big bait, well, I'm ma tell you straight
Honey child, I'm keepin' the faith""",Keeping the Faith (Just a Touch Mix)
De La Soul,"Now let's get right on down to the skit
A baby is brought into a world of pits
And if it could've talked that soon
In the delivery room
It would've asked the nurse for a hit
The reason for this?
The mother is a jerk
Excuse me, Junkie
Which brought the work of the old
Into a new light
What a way
But this what a way
Has been a way of today
Anyway
Push couldn't shove me to understand a path to a basehead
Consumer should erase it in the first wave
But second wave forms believers
And believers will walk to it then even talk to it and say...
(You got the body now you want my soul)
Nah, can't have none of that, tell 'em what to say Mase...

SAY NO GO

Nah, no my brother
No my sister
Try to get hip to this
Word, word to the mother
I'll tell the truth so bear my witness
Fly like birds of a feather
Drugs are like Pleather
You don't wanna wear it
No need to ask that question, just don't mention
You know what the answer is

Now I never fancied Nancy
But the statement she made held a plate of weight
I even stressed it to Wade

Did he take any heed?

Nah, the boy was hooked, you could've phrased the word ""Base""
And the kid just shook
In his fashion class once an A now an F
The rock rules him now
The only designs left
Were once clothes made for Oshkosh
Has converted to nothing but stonewash

Now hopping in a barrel is a barrel of fun
But don't hop in if you want to be down, son
Cause that could mean down and out as an action
What does it lead to?
Dum-da-dum-dum
People say what have I done for all my years
My tears show my hard-earned work
I heard shoving is worse than pushing
But I'd rather know a shover than a pusher
Cause a pusher's a jerk

SAY NO GO

Believe it or not the plot forms a fee more that charity
But the course doesn't coincide with the ride of insanity
Is it a chant that slants the soul to fill for it?
I know it's the border that flaunts the order to kill for it

Standing, scheming on a young one
Taking his time, eight-ball for a cool pool player
Racked it all, tried to break, miscued
Got beat by the boy in blue
Next day you're out by the spot once more
Looking hard for a crack in the hole
I ask what's the fix for the ill stuff
Word to the Dero
The answer should have been no

Run me a score from the Funky Four Plus One More
(It's the joint!)
Rewind that back
This is the age for a new stage of fiend
Watch how the zombies scream
It's the crack
Plain is plain it should explain it from the start
Behind the ideals of cranking up the heart
Now the base claim's shot over every part

SAY NO GO

DON""T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT

SAY NO GO

SAY NO GO",Say No Go (Say No Dope Mix)
De La Soul,"And now for my next number
I'd like to return to the classics
Perhaps the most famous classic
In all the world of music

The first time around you didn't quite
Understand our new style of speak
(Don't worry, we can fix that right now)
So, why don't you all just grab your bags?
(Come on aboard, hoist the anchor and we'll be off)

Plug one, plug two, plug one, plug two
Plug one, plug two, plug one

Answering any other service
Prerogative praised, positively I'm acquitted
Enemies publicly shame my utility
After the battle they admit that I'm with it

Simply soothe, will move vinyl like glue
Transistors are never more shown with like
When vocal flow brings it all down in ruin
Due to a clue of a naughty noise called, 'Plug tunin''

Flock to the preacher called Pos
Let him be the stir to the style of your stew
Sit while the kid of the plug form aroma
Then grab a daisy to sip your favorite brew

Lettin' this soul fire be your first prior
But don't let the kick drum stub your big toe
See that the three will be your thread
But like my man Chuck D said, ?What a brother know?

Dance while I play and the cue cards sway
From my flower girls China and Jette
The button is pressed in '89 we'll start the panic
From De La Soul and a prince from stet

Negative noise will be all divided
Dangerous to dance, Posdnuos will croon
Ducks and kizids will all be rid
When paying position to the naughty noise called, 'Plug tunin''

Plug one, plug two, plug one, plug two
Plug one, plug two, plug one, plug two

Freeze, 'cause these are the brothers
Brothers of the soul who present a new flick
Every last viewer is tuned to the method
Known to be a method, no magicians, not a trick

Bitten by the spoken who been titled plug two
Swallowed by the loonies who are jealous with the showbiz
Dove'll teach the truth, Posdnuos will preach the youth
To the fact that this will bring an end to the negative

Flow to the sway 'cause I say, ?Fa So La Ti?
At the top we will dwell
Difference is fame and we rise then we build
Where we are set we get fat and we swell

Motions of the soul is a positive stride
One step forward is the space we consume
Vivid as the moon, you have yet to assume
How the soul found the motto of a naughty noise called, 'Plug tunin''

Vocal is local so believe that
This chant shan't rely on the strong lap
Trying and live so you best realize
That the gift that I present, I say gift wrap

Style of the tune is personal
And defining what's the rhyme is worst of all
Stop, sit and study 'cause the meaning isn't muddy
Just preach and do the gear as the first of all

Watch while the pitcher is pitching
'Cause this is the pitch of the year
Sing a simple song but keep the swing strong
Though you heard dove crying 'I ain't fair'

Those who think De La's on the flip tip
Try to flip this and you're doomed
Watch for the be be, 'cause if you try to grieve me
You'll be hung by the wire of the plug tune

I can't twist your arm and make you stay with me
(Are you ready for this?)",Plug Tunin'
De La Soul,"Sometimes the world is a valley of heartaches and tears
And in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears
But you and I have our love always there to remind us
There is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us
Volare, oh, oh! Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather a rainbow together we'll find
Volare, oh, oh! Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
No wonder my happy heart sings

Verse One: 
A bitch nigga wit an attitude named Cube 
Step to Com wit a feud 
Now what the fuck I look like dissing a whole coast 
You ain't made shit dope since AmeriKKKa's Most 
Wanted to cease from the Midwest to the East 
On the dick of the East for your 1st release 
Your lease is up at the crib house niggaz get evicted 
And videos wit white boys talking you get Wicked 
Natural Born Killa, nigga you natural born God 
Look, read listen, got the nerve to say you rob 
Hyprocrite, I'm filling out your Death Certificate 
Slanging bean pies and St Ide's in the same sentence 
Shoulda repented, on the 16th of October 
Get some beats besides George Clinton to rock over 
Rap career is over, better off acting 
What trouble I see, you're managing WC and Wack 10 
You backed in to a four corner hustla 
Lying on your dick, said you was fuckin her 
Use Higher Learning, don't take my words out of text 
Went from gangsta to Islam to the dick of Das EFX 
It'll take the Nation of Millions to Hold Me Back 
From giving you mouth shots or hit wit the pipe Ralph got 
When sucker ain't around, it's your Friday, it was good 
I wasn't salty, she was wit the Boyz N the Hood 
Chorus: 
I see the bitch in you when you don't speak your mind 
The bitch in you, looking me in my eyes lyin 
I see the bitch in you, simply hard, you find 
The bitch in you but yo it's coming out 
Verse Two: 
Up on this rap shit, Cube, I'm calling out 
I break in and smack niggaz that's in the Slaughterhouse 
This ain't no East coast, West coast, none of the above 
I'm from Chi, I went to Cali, niggaz gave me love 
There's a thin line between the fake and the real 
Grafted ass nigga, I see through your Glass Shield 
Had skills once upon a time on this project, yo 
I'm a have ta wreck a Ho'shea 
I heard a ho say you her favorite rapper 
(So what) so I had to slap her, ugn 
And violate you, a Muslim drinking brew 
Your nigga ain't no Mack 10, he's a 22 
I seen you, you ain't say shit to ATL 
Cube, I like that diamond charm, I might cuff it, then sell 
It out, like you sold Kam and Threat 
A year ago, you wasn't talking shit about the West 
Guess you knew you're shit was done plus the one got you cable 
Hoo Bangin, you ain't banging shit but the table 
And the Circle Madd, ain't got no choice but to fight 
Ain't none of y'all muthafukas got a chance on the mic 
Anytime you come out, yo, I'm a talk about you 
Until you let that bitch in you, walk up out you 
Any last words before I hit the switch 
From the immortal words of one, a bitch is a bitch

No knives, no drama, no guns
No disrespectin' your seed or Ma Dukes
I puke rhyme and you laugh, take a sniff
of these fricaseed raps on Caribbean riffs
See last night's change was today's dough money
No time for your freestyles so roll money
No more whack albums with two joints
No more ballplayin' rappers who shoot ya two points
(No more G cause I'm sick of your hip-hop!)
Your flows bore like seashores with no bitches
Switchhittin' niggaz will receive no pitches
No diamonds on the field, just keep the game real
simple, see the God flows healthy
Wealth in the mind is like money in the bank
Exchange cash like thoughts in conversation
Thank you for your purchases, we dough out
and roll out the cool-Aid, {?} see us pimp strut
Ain't really pimpin', I'm tryin' to catch the bus
The Krush Groove ain't got shit on Cold Crush!
We dolly dolly babies cause we shootin' cats
'Back to the Future' rap with Doc Brown shotgunnin' it
And pantyhose your whole style and start runnin' it
You dudes fiddle while we stay on the cello
The mush-in-your-room son, we stay portobello
Can't settle for the same picket white fence
I got dreams of barbed wire in front of factories pa
Still push the truck with the factories pa
I'm bound to wreck the whip and turn insurance out, make 'em shout

]Yo how the days of your life go Com? (I'm just tryin' to be)
That's it? (Stayin' focused so my mind is free)
Watch the problems of the world go by like balloons
If tomorrow come now (it might be too soon)
Too soon?

I want the boom in the back of the truck
Ain't nuttin' the matter with a good dude havin' a buck
With that on my mind, I'm on the grind, it pays
We break it down in these three ways, yo

These days, I travel the Maze like Frank Beverly
To the East, lookin' for pieces of a better me
Responsibility of my man's felony fell on me
Celebrity status, make 'em think I got celery

Hell and I do sometimes, still the sunshine ain't even all day
(Yeah) The life of a baller, ain't even all play
I stack 'em, so the chips fall where they must
I ain't far from a Benz, or dude on the bus

Even when I don't have enough, still in God I trust
Said baby you're a star
Said I'm on the car, seen the jiggiest of stars
Become dust, and one love become lust for the papers
Had you gassed now that - gas became vapors
Tricked your cash on ice; shoulda had acres
Now your, empire fell like the Lakers
So you're talkin' to your maker

It's the nature of the business, they givin' niggaz inches
Takin' miles and mules, it's the wildest rules
I'm tryin' to walk in the black scent of proudest shoes
Makin music that the crowds can use

[Chorus: ]
Yo how the days of your life go Dave? (With sunshine and shade)
That's it? (Tinted window grades and Kool-Aid)
Watch the problems of the world go by like balloons
If tomorrow come now (that might be too soon)
Too soon?

I want twenty-four plus on these
Put the Pinto engine and the bus on these
I get that first class seat to escape the days
We break it down in these three ways

Check the life I got that antidote, cantelope scent, bent back
In the sunroom froze, put your flick on pause (and pop a cork)
There's no occasion nigga it's just because
I'm celebratin' for a hell of a day

Get these barbie filets on hot charcoal tracks, so black
Darko Pecoltrane plays them back
We them freedom fight kids who gon' ball and raise fists
If y'all down for the struggle, c'mon y'all, resist

Everyday script, I exercise cheek
Sixteen on the bar, I exercise speak (ha)
It's been a long time, Long Isle's on the map
While y'all stand on the corner, stoned like Chris Back
Kiss back, watchin' time - wrist back
Every second count but just finish this lap
You gamble on your life like casino slots
And cash out and still walk with a knot

[Chorus: ] 
Yo how the days of your life goes Merce? (Man I'm just holdin' my head)
That's it? (Shit, I'm also tryin' to hold this bread)
Watch the problems of the world go by like balloons
If tomorrow come now (that might be too soon)
Too soon?

I furnished the rooms, and mortgage on these
See them quittin' ass rappers caused a shortage on these
The soul boys of big illa-noyz get the praise
We break it down in these three ways

My moms died from secondhand smoke; so I wish yo' ass would die
From them secondhand rhymes you wrote
Or shall I call them second rhymes - written seconds 'fore you enter the booth
Words thrown together with very little truth
And a select few can do it (true) you ain't part of them scriptures
And got the nerve to feel you want me out the picture
But I was never in it, I'm the frame around the flick
Or dishin' in the mouth of your dame around my dick

Ladies and gentlemen, introducin' Workmatic
One of L.I.'s finest, and this is (my life)
Which is filled with bad minutes and good hours
And, good months and bad years and with my peers
We struggle to juggle the shit
Family life and the music game don't easily fit

My lady wants me home, sayin' rap tour three rap whores
And scores of scandal, even more than we can handle
Sometimes, the rhymes I say
Is the fly the currency to save the day
Can't turn it away, cause we out
To find presence way beyond our measure, so baby don't pout

Don't pout, De La Soul now turn it out
Don't pout, Common Sense'll turn it out
Don't pout..",Days of Our Lives

We are singing
You this message
Through our music 
Reaching for a, brave and brighter, new tomorrow 
Is the future
We must make it, safe and happy, for the children
Or...or...they will be lost
Or...or...they will be lost

Aiyyo I jump back, put the aim on my shot
It's mandatory, handle glory over with the rock
I'm not a rough guy but a tough guy to beat over drums
No son to this, I'm a rhyme bastard

Some mastered the art of cash, but not the part that lasts
And disappear after doin' two albums
We're not your normal team and we still do ours to fit
Hope inside this, don't define it's
Quits for those who oppose the new
Playin' they've outgrown rap, like a size 5 shoe
Oh they all neo now, alternative touch
Were surprised, no demise for us
We on the rise to bust big, how you fig' we couldn't
Never run out of verbs for you to sip, I told you we wouldn't
I never popped Crist' or popped fists, girl named Chrissie
Was the first, which made it even worse not to miss me

Or... or... they will be lost (the future)
Or... or... they will be lost (the future)

So do you understand it now?  Well try standin' over
Seven box sets, reppin' sixteen years
This rap career ain't work, it's the life in-between
Bedtime 'til the next said time and date
Know the name and salute them dudes
Put the nutrient in rap when they cook them foods
Gotta be like eighteen million heads served
Shit, imagine if there wasn't no us huh?

So I'd like to take the time to shout out the JB's
Next on my list is A Tribe Called Quest
Latifah my Queen, Monie Love, Dres and Mr. Lawnge
Chi-Ali, on your head God bless
Never ring chasin', the permanent tat
In this rap shit, y'all are just temporary lick-ons
Fadin' in the days to come

Down, like water, fresh out the clouds, clown.
Drown you like terrible weather.
Nobody does it better than I, so approved by Carly Simon.
Most rappers is real hard, but still hardly rhymin'.
To all - rise and shine; give God the glory.
I already give a percent of mine to Bert and Cory,
And still got bills and employees to pay.
So excuse me, Lord, we'll settle up towards the end of my days.
My ways of control is hard to swallow.
Known to lead, but some would rather see me follow behind.
Sorry to dis-appoint, but dis joint's mine.
Dis-play your indie, but say no more or I'll blind you like spit did to Remo.
To the dirt, and edit the clip and lost Kano.
My mens wear problems like Timbs.
See it all in they face; ask Mase, he got wars to win,
Scores to settle, crews to crush.
You rush right in to see him do it with a smile.
It's Long Isle y'all; longevity sustainin' my celebrity status.
From A-M to P-M, you see him on file, y'all.
I was told to step righteous, so when it's done
Everyone will say I stepped right.
And whether through religion, or stopped by the cop,
Shinin' his flash in my face, I'm bound to see the light.

""A few short words, and whaddya know?""
""Oh, whaddya know?  He comes.""

Aiyyo, I'm up against these walls; here's my back, stiff, straight up.
Dazzle and razzlin' broads like I'm little Juan Magic.
Magnetically handle mics, they don't drop.
Top drama every time these commas don't drop.
Pop spots like lint on your shirt; the net worth.
To shoot the rock homey in many courts of ball;
Four couldn't do it, so we bring all six.
I circumcise the track; you just a dick, overlapped and hooded.
Skin repeated like Stutterin' John.
I repeat like yesterday; it don't stop.
George of this poor life, pop, put to Scarlet;
In a place she believes much better than your lies.
She say she lookin' better in my eyes; bullshit!
Same crock she done ran to duck, crammin' to fuck.
I put the pudding on her like Bill Cosby.
I tried to speak my piece in court, but Judge Mills paused me.
Bifocusedly die, hopeless sometimes.
Yo, cry your poker face; you oughta try it one time.
When God is an non pos' you stand to download.
Demanded like slaves on trial; we want free.
Man, cock aim ready; it's time you MC.
So you rappers bust bibi guns; graffiti runs
Through my veins, since cable with the wired remote.
Woodgrainin' like you wired his float.

C'mon, Pretty Toney and De La Soul.

Tony 'Tana with big hammers for bad manners; who got 'em?
We kiss cannons for Scrangelous crew and his whack dancers.
Bitin' is forbidden, pah, pay that tax.
And don't you ever look at us funny, boy, we'll bring rap back.
And that'll hurt you like Superman, chased by a group of men.
With dyna-mics, real hip-hop'll do you in.
For you like Loo Goo Kim, or Moo Loo Inn.
Hula hoop all bitches; crew full with brand new Keds.
Cutmaster kill 'em; make sure we cut classics.
Buck bastards in broad day and tuck caskets.
Next to Uday and Qusay, how can the group shoot the P-A,
And just lay whooptay, whooptay?
Use the ruse, sport beads, and snatch a dude's toupee.
Since tunin' into T-La Rock'n A-J,
Ghostface gats is freshed squeezed, like a glass of O-J.
Girls, you can go cruisin' in my O-J.

It's like, New York without a New York yanks
Better yet, New York without the New York franks
It's like hot summers without no A.C
Or never hitting numbers when you go to A.C
It's like six years of your life, go ask Rob
I'm like ""Yo how is it?"" he like ""It's like hard""
Trying for that queen but you nothing but a man
You want to keep it clean but you can't
Why it gotta be, like, that
And what the life, see life is like a J shot
Shooters son, they got
One point one second, you half court
I'm feeling the adrenaline like you half court
Like pink slips and dipping these ink tips to paper
Imagine if we fuck around and lose Hip-hop
Imagine if it didn't exist
Imagine nothing shining your wrist
See, imagining to you is a risk
But think about it, like no chrome rims
And tims would be construction boots (ill)
We probably wouldn't even substitute (ill)
For words we use defining our likes
I'm coal mining these mics
To keep that gold nugget like Dave Megget
Giant like a motherfucker, like Dave said it
But ya ain't listening, ya paper gon' stack
Why it gotta be like that?

Like what I do with it? I copped a few with it
Looking like a problem, but you won't get it solved
You working but you won't get the job
It's like, who would of thought (thought)
It you would of bought (bought)
Into my religion you'd be more like God
But you were steady swimming so you more like cod
See these fools is fish scale, converting to ish male
See I see it like, A alike, be	 alike
I was taught, if you play alike, be alike
How they don't see it for one to go pop
And this is how you treat Hip-hop?
Imagine if you didn't have that phantom chrome sitting on a curb nigga
The word nigga wouldn't be a bit disturbing nigga
See them roots are like begging for the rain
You entering my kingdom just a begging for the reign
Putting shit stain to paper
Ink pain feeling like fifty-five licks on a slave niggas back
And not a one of y'all stopping to hate
But why it gotta be like that?

We stayed original ever since y'all
First to do a lot of things in the game, but the last to say it
No need to place it on a scale to weigh it
And don't do it for the plays or to raise the bar
Yet it's raised anyway, it's so amazing, are
The three L.I. brothers from a other way of thinkin

Yep, yep, big trucker man's rollin' in town
How ya do, how ya do
I got the joints to make ya
(Jump)
Because I'm headin' eastbound
Tired of the merry go round and around

And everybody's talkin' 'bout you're so funny
But they still tellin' lies to me
I got the trees in my backyard
And it's hard for them to tell a lie to me

And who's the foot, I'm the foot but who's steppin'
(Ain't no half steppin')
You know where I'm steppin'
Skirts play wit it 'cause I'm slick like that
I'm the greatest MC in the world

You gots to gimme, gimme mine
'Cause I'm heavy when I weigh it
Watch the way I say it
(Ego trip)
Change my pitch up, smack my bitch up, I never did it
The flavor's bein' butt but brothers ain't gettin' it

Get it or else you're a goner
When I rolls over ya gonna have to wanna lamp
'Cause it's the chattanooga champ
Takin' a train, takin' a train, takin' a train, takin' a train

Now I'm somethin' like a phenomenon
I'm somethin' like a phenomenon
Well, I'm the hourglass cat
Drug it out of jack
For Jill

'Cause I spilled the phenomenon
Pack the holes in my lawn
The girls in my sauna
Word is born I'm a livin' phenomenon

Well, I'm a better brand 'cause I'm a Superman
I run the block with my circle 'cause I'm Nubian
I got the platinum rust, so don't even fuss
'Cause DJ Paul, he's down wit us

Now people stop takin' my stylin' for a joke
I don't sassafrass I put the foot up the ass
Sometimes I'm fast, blow off like a seal
When they reminisce over you
For real

Mase chopped the record down to the bone
And now Renee King is on my telephone
But I got the ring, ring, ha, ha, hey, hey
'Cause this type of shit it happens everyday
I got to make me a connection so my imports stuff
(Word)

Wo, word 'em up, 'cause I'm so fly
Yes on and on
I'm ins like [unverified] go buy my yacht
I got Gills like Johnny, sail at 7 elf
(Well, good for ya)
Bigger than bigs, dig it
(I dug it)
Ways that amazes popes

I am the is equals is 'cause it's caught up
When the tides taught me the ropes
No weights for the baits
(Man I'll give you four)
For a verb unheard of
(Man gimme one more)

Alright you got it if you're special
With a dapper toe tapper when a lot's goin' on
(And ain't a damn thing happenin')
The answer to the riddle is me and here's the question

Who can be
(Fresh?)
Who can be
(Dope?)
Who can be
(Nice?)

Who can be
(Beautiful?)
Who can be
(Word?)
Who can be

Me be the Jericho turnpike bandit
Yes, competition try to troupe my way
I sing the song you never heard before
I feed the famine in your mind
So mind ya manners baby

I run a line on ya
Lay ya on the springs then sway ya
All this and a condom 'cause I be a taxpayer
Promotin' of a moccasin, I skin like Danny Boone

When I swallow hear the
(Gulp)
So give me room just give me room back the hell up
Back the hell up
Know what I'm sayin'
Or when I run the mic there won't be no delayin'
Pressure 40 does it like a Easy Bake oven

Blues got the muffin
Eat it
Blues got the muffin
Eat it
Intoxicate many wit my talk
Without intoxicatin' myself low
So I gots to walk slow but
Don't you get too high

Girl meets boy on Thursday night
Boy was high, girl fly like kite
They hold hands until next day
Boy then lets go, hit his way
Boy rules butt, brags to his boys
Erection brings bad boy joys
Boy thinks of that big fat back
Big black fat love, big black fat
Girl calls boy to stand him up on Saturday
Saturday

Saturday, it's a Saturday
It's a Saturday, it's a Saturday
Saturday, it's a Saturday
Saturday, it's a Saturday

Back once more with the wallop in the score
Must I ride and rip, should I make you rock your hip
Reviver of a roller-boogie in a rink
And sure to make you think about the times
To scope fun instead of fights
(But diving from a piece of metal sure to take your life)
Yo, slip your butt to the fix of this mix
Toss that briefcase, it's time to let loose
Cause you've worked like heck to get the week in check
So unfasten that noose around your neck
Connected like a vibe from the wheel to the foot
Come on everybody dig the funky output

Five days you work
One whole day to play
Come on everybody, wear your rollerskates today
It's Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, it's Saturday
Saturday, it's Saturday
Saturday, it's Saturday-ay
(Is the word, is the word, is the word)

Now as you pump your fist I reminisce
To a bounce, rock, skate, roll
Fess to impress
Hey, pretty diamond, do you like the way I'm dressed
Cool, keep the faith and be my mate
Cause all we need is feet
(And rollerskates)
But promote the hustle cause it keeps me thin
No need to talk, look who just walked in

(Is there a Dred on skates?)
Yes, man
(So kick the wham on this jam)
Oh Mr. Sprinkler, Mr. Sprinkler
Wet me for one, Mr. Sprinkler
I'm heatin' high-five in a daze, no split
With a yawn I trip to the dawn
Out comes the bodies following the one idea
It's clear, rattle to the roll
Hold back up the track, grab your rollerskates y'all
And let's zip on by
Zip-a-de-doo-dah, let's zip on by
Feed on a weed and we're feeling high
Sun is on thick and the cheese is rollin' quick
Come on, there's no time to hide
Season is twist, spinning and winning
No hackeysack, let let me in
Spill on the bottom away, but it's okay, huh
It's a Saturday

Now let's all get baked like Anita

Watch Mr. Lawnge, don't look at the peter

Feel on the fun, I'll feel on the

Hey, watch that!

It's a Saturday

Now is the time
To act the fool tonight
Forget about your worries and you will be all right

Dissect survival, passed on the whisper
Placed on the mother crew shouting, now it's the
Boys who shot joy inside the violent
Hell from New York with a mars inside it
From the bottom of the deck, who got squashed
They call us the a little coke cheese, let's get the engine, baby

Too many dreams, a paperweight took a toll
Food on the floor, not to be wasted
Or what's being pasted and know that it's not a copy
Eye on a prize instead of gas prices
Lyrically wonder why I travel past the nicest
Born in a generation that don't generate patience
I travel too fast for you to clock me (Time)
Not always a good thing
You can lose the love of your life to a lifetime of love on tour

Had me like a fiend screamin' ""What you got for me?""

But then they all started talking
They were talking about love being gone
In my house
They said that there ain't much left to love
Well, there's always something to love if you're familiar enough to recognize it
I mean have you cried for anything lately?
And I don't mean for your friends or your bills or yourself
I mean, for this!
When do you think it's time to love something the most, child?
When it's successful? And have made everything easy for us, huh?

De La Soul,"Fresh from a bible belt town
That's what she's givin' up
Not really livin', just flesh comin' off a Greyhound
That's what he think of her
Right at a blink of an eye he provides her with charm
Hides that he is a shark
Suggests a few apartments, never hints to the home
That's what he wanna do
She just wanna new zip code for an old dream
Lost in an appetite now the big apple might
Find her habit of a queen
Feel the negro that's filled with an equal match road
Destination unknown
She's Little Bow Peep
And her and her whole sheep gonna have their wool unsewn
Now the wolf give a push
Now watch her jump in with two feet
Blue heat don't know how to swim through the limbs
Everyone huggin' her, tuggin' her
Ride on the merry-go-round of four drinks and two white lines
Go fast with the fast life so she needs more
One fun fix, now a daily chore
Provide the score, written and produced so perverse
He's a pro well versed
Told her that the purse that she want
With the shoes that she love and the rent that she need paid
She can earn with speed in a day
Escort on the high class side
Champagne glass rides
White snow waterfalls, oh how time flies
When you're flyin', crash and burn
She learned that her soul was dyin'
That's worth savin'
She's cravin' that bible belt town
So she crawls back on the Greyhound

Take your seats please
I know exactly where you're goin', I can see it on your face

Fresh new Gucci belt, bound
Fast to the city scape
Dash to deliver fate
Stashed in this duffel bag, proud
He's no scaredy cat
Life always spared in thy name
That the gamblers fold
No chips if the scramble got cold
But them warm cushions and them soft bus seats
Push that second thought along
Beneath the roof of a Super 8, he sleeps 'til it's night time
Then connects in the streets like a pipe line
In dark shades he supplies dark brigades
Of lost souls with his chemical morsels
He's no lab tech
He was born into a legacy stretched from Aztecs and beyond
Assets he was drawn to
Had him spinnin' the wool over his mother's eye
He's the black sheep
His pops career driven, he's the backseat
The man on the wheel that cruises on sunrise
That the man bought eyes to his pay per view
The kind of paper make a fool shoot a staple through
And take the label too
Until he's campaign
Unitl a pancake pocket change the landscape
Take a short visit home in the town
It's time to re-up, it's back on the Greyhound

Next stop, NYC
Take your seats please
I know exactly where you're goin', I can see it on your face

By the time you arrive, you'll forever be changed
By the time you arrive, you'll forever be changed
Forever be changed, forever be changed
Just watch where you're goin'
And this food you're chosin'
I don't need to check your baggage

Let me see how many palms go up high
If you've ever felt the world had you licked (put 'em up high)
And what you waving side to side to symbolize
Needing help on the sand 'fore you under quick
Big mama said ""the Devil's up to no good""
But we can heal it on a Sunday with a good book (but)
Oft we deal it on a Monday for a good look (and)
Make it part of the campaign, to withstand pain
Me, myself, place it all on my shoulders
And give it my all, like heavy lifting
No gain without tears and sweat
They claim blue skies with white clouds, steady drifting
When pain come to get ya (it hit ya like flu)
Better times will pick ya (do what you gotta do)
To earn focus in the stormy weather
Come out the tunnel to the light saying

Pain will make you better
Tell me how you feel
Look over your shoulder

No wetter, four-letter, mo' better
Slow pain, no gain, go getta
Change like the weather
Solid as a rock, small piece of leather
But well put together
Flames are endeavors
Time to find out that game makes it better
Pain makes it better
Shades of epiphany, can't let it get to me
Move so differently, do it so swiftly
Ease into my style, lay mine down
King be crowned, look at me now
Teaching my classes by the masses
Used to gang bang, used to love the clashes
Now cash is the only motivation, but not for me G
I’m into public relations
That's food for your De La Soul, word to the letter

Pain will make you better
Tell me how you feel

Give me no excuses
I know how ya feel
Pain will make it better (yeah)
Pain will make it better (oh whoa whoa ah)
(I heard my nana say it, say it)

Yo, the bigger the headache, bigger the pill
The harder you fall, stronger the will
We came from the back of the bus
Talking ""Watch the mobile,"" now we're on a house on a hill
The struggle went from filling ya gas tank
The bank wasn't feeling your loan
The OT couldn't cover the bills
And life came with a couple of spills
But we're gonna use that pain fo' fuel so

Give me no excuses
I know how ya feel

Yo, a slow burn we are
Last long three man act to wake up your thermostat
Blood through the property line
Creative minds crossover and back
Scribble with my knife to earn that slice of life
Cock back, aim, shot the name wherever the price is right
The pain earned is the pain learned and it's talking like burn
Connect (to the same as it ever was)
Respect the lane cause it never flood, it's well irrigated
Looking for my vanity, it's there, the mirror hate it
State it, stop being an MC and give your verses more weight
For being just empty, thoughts are oxidised when I spit em out
And my lungs prefer tastes encrypted words laced to get them out home
We're removal service to get kings out the throne
(More hands on) With hands upon the neck
Of a voice magnifier over decks
The sound is found at the young's in the batch
Lovely how I let my mind flow

Rappers is not try and see me like a diamond tester
I'm all alone, I'm like a silent investor
Well dressed, my suit and vest is never polyester
Keep a shottie on the dresser
My queen look like a young pepper
Up in her plump compress her
My tongue is forever under the weather, however
My heart was still lighter than a feather
Culturally, snort em like cocoa leaf
Them niggas suck more milk no tea
I'm on the low though in my Polo tee
The show cost money but the promo's free
My pen collection is interesting
No steal, still niggas will feel threatened
My genetics is comedic
Driven in lanes I was looking angelic
Psychedelic, if you was like it I can sell it
But I don't fuck with that sweet shit, I'm diabetic
This is rapping at it's peak
The bird steady yapping at the beat

Crooked eye letters from Madoff, apologise

Sucker for love
Yeah I'm that dude

She give good oral
When I'm not with her

I'm half a man without a one to call

She's a wonder-doll

Wouldn't write me off like the last offer

It's illegal
How those kids can come from out of the slums to live so regal
Lose it all on a prayer to the evil
Before the loss we earn for the cause
Toast to the life life though my liver won't endorse
Currently in time and my enzymes
Are in sync to digest the brink of armageddon
The veterans over the mattress, we lay with the actress
For social media to swallow us
Watch them rap peers who don't reply back
Cause they think we gon' snatch up their Twitter followers
That's some female type foolery
And your females like glue to it
She know it, the scent of a poet
Police buy restraint to cover all the angles
A opera of operations
See one got all you in your crew confident with courage
We'll be there jumping your square record

And my cousin on parole cause he sold Glocks

Told you we have more soul than James Brown
Wearing a gold watch that obviously don't work
Used to go home and rob niggas for homework
See if the chrome work
Might call your girl to see if my phone work
I'm a hood star and the trophy is a gold vert
Mouth full of gold teeth
Niggas might end up obsolete if I'm four deep

Bedroom floor filled up with the loose leaf
This is a war zone, me and a two-piece
Put another head on and make it a new piece

When I'm in the booth I'm Kanye with a gun out

Got a bunny hopping a quick ten seconds
Dear Lord, forgive a nigga, I've been down with out
Had the frog legs, now I'mma knock this piggie out
Now Dave like to cuddle, but Dave don't play that
Like Dave had the ring, listen, Dave ain't say that

Keep your feet off the grass size eleven the gas
Mash that potato 'till we lay in the grass

If she the mermaid give her the fish stick
First class flight, shoot her out to the district
Wait, cancel the stallion, hold your horses
Kickstart your life and cut your losses
Look how we did 'em, ma, your boy still got it
I quit drinking, I quit the narcotics
Life's a bitch, but she seeing a therapist
This hip hop done dilly to cameras, huh
We got stoops and vander robes to sit on
Big coins Vivian Mears to bid on
But we cautious
Never undermine the hate and turn the spell on your evil forces

Communities that care and nurture

I am part of something bigger than the heartache
Wishing wishing you
Every happiness in your escape

You're not the only one in my mouth
You're the face I want to lose
You're not the only face in my head

Sterilizes the pin to myself

The daylight saving me from myself

Then the dark is coming in my blinds

Still the dark is coming in

",Nocturne for an Absentee
De Rosa,"I compose, every center, every perspective
Any part is a nose
I propose, a way of looking, or a way of looking past this
Our redemption shows perfect stillness

Baby Love, is the shadow of our existence
Any wiseman knows to keep his distance
Its not enough my desire fake some illness
Every liar knows to keep his stillness
Well I am stillness

I arose from the backplate, from the blank slate
I remember smoke
And all the fires of November paint our blood on our back doors
And I remember him still at the corner
He's still at the corner

Baby time, is the shadow of our existence
Any wiseman knows to keep his distance
Its not enough my desire to fake some illness
Every liar knows to keep his stillness
Well I am stillness

Come back tomorrow, because we'll never get it done

All he sees is the lights in her her eyes
She feels his hand and smells his warm breath
Looking up all she sees is the night sky

She saw him walking the whole town behind him
He loved to whisper gently to her
She heard the whole world shouting and screaming

Oh since first we met
My dark sweet silhouette
Oh nothing nothing you forget
In your heart my dark my dark sweet silhouette

He told her everything he wanted her to know
She showed him the big picture
He gave her beads and clothes and promises
She gave him golden strings and things that don't break down

Oh nothing nothing you forget

Deacon Blue,"I wrote this once before
Long before the summer
You were then a student
And we were dark as angels
We were in the east
Working to the west
The west was looking south
And the south she had no pity
But last night I dreamed
And you were always
In it
There were
Hopes and plans and schemes
And the town was full of winners
Oh brother
Oh sister
This changing light
Has lighted things so
Differently
Has lighted things so
Differently
I wrote this once before
And we were all then working
We thought we`d stop the flow
Of a cruel and heartless woman
If I`d known this then
What would these wings have done
They`d have beat and flapped and flown
And not done and not done
But last night I dreamed
And you were always
In it
There were
Hopes and plans and schemes
And the town was full of winners

I kept it in the dark

I stuffed it in my pocket

Deacon Blue,"So maybe you're standing
In some foreign town
You've walked for miles
'Til the heat slows you down

And your jeans and your curls
Are bleached and split
And your money and your anger
Are all used up

Maybe I'm sorry
About the light in this place
Makes my heart seem cold
As the words on these pages

Maybe I'm reminded
By a shop window display or a decoration
Like some church candle that might just burn

'Cause we're dancing under chandeliers and I'm telling you
Caught in the headlights and I'm yelling it at you
Why is it girl when the world is lit by lightning
That I keep telling you that I love you

So you're ten miles out
Of this city at night
When do coloured lights
Become paint and glass and dust
And how I wonder
What light to trust
The light of the distance
Or the candle that might just burn

'Cause we're dancing under chandeliers and I'm telling you
Caught in the headlights and I'm yelling it at you
Why is it girl when the world is lit by lightning
That I keep telling you that I love you

Seraphim and cherubim
Skies full of gold dust
Moonshine and starlight
Pockets full of rainbows

Windows and mirrored balls
Porcelain and silverlake
Dance hall neons flash and swing
Blow out your candles

It will call you angel

Talking diamonds talking steel
Don't talk things that, folk don't know
Talk about money and stuff that's real

For the company from the south
Tells the stories of how things are there
Talks about their life talks about ours

And watch those trains pull in and out

Deacon Blue,"I think the whole world should look good
That's important to me
Everyone should look good
And when they die they should die with their boots on
And their hearts on fire

When I die they'll cry
I'll have candy and chocolate whirls
And party gowns framing bonny girls
Will carry me off to Disneyworld

I think the whole world should be funny
That's important to me
If you can't be funny don't be ugly
When they speak they should speak with their hands firmly on their hearts

When I die they'll cry
I'll have candy and chocolate whirls
And party gowns framing bonny girls
Will carry me off to Disneyworld

I like to see people happy
Singing on the way to work
Children and animals happy
When they laugh they should laugh like us
Not like other creatures do

I'll have candy and chocolate whirls
And party gowns framing bonny girls
Will carry me off to Disneyworld

Deacon Blue,"Tomorrows a holiday and we will be high all day
Singing and playing shows and going as far as the country bus goes
And the bands will be swinging as high as the swing boat goes
And the trees will be swaying and the boats will be heading out to the sea

Hey don't let the teardrops start for all of the times you've had
Go now and rest your weary heart
Tomorrow is near

'cause' all the friends are departing the night skies are parting
Late drinkers are singing their way home and the tower bell is ringing over the ????
Seems like the country is smiling the good times returning
Don't let your eyes start clouding and your old songs start bringing you down again

Hey don't let the teardrops start for all of the times you've had

",Don't Let the Teardrops Start
Deacon Blue,"There was ice and broken pavements on the hill tower
And the light was falling from the infirmary
And the last of the dogs was barking
At the steps from gentle teardrops and me

And I asked about her sister and her mother
And her uncle Tom serving on the sea
And her grampa's gammy leg that kept him in his bed
And kept out gentle teardrops and me

And its a long way to keep up conversation
When your broken up over fish 'n' chips and peas
And the grease is on your arm
Like a girl you've never worn
Walking home gentle teardrops and me

It's a cold cold night..Its a cold cold night
And I won't forget September is your birthday
And the prisons been paid up for fifteen weeks
And I'll send it through to ease
You can take it as you please
With love the gentle teardrops from me
With love the gentle teardrops ........from...me

With gentle teardrops...Ahh we're rolling home

Deacon Blue,"I take off my glasses and I pull on my shirt
I call up my friends on my long ,long list
I said I've got a reason just to get to the coast
I'll stand on the streets where all the books were wrote

I remember words
That ran around my head
And made no sense at all
And rained right off my tongue
Like mother, love and Ronnie Spector

I'm in an old Humber
That takes a long, long road
And remembering the smell
Of summer on the parcel shelf
And opening up the quarter light
And holding out a scythe
That levels out the landscape
As a car, car travels

I remember words
That ran around my head
And made no sense at all
And rained right off my tongue
Like mother, love and Ronnie Spector

If these things don't get me
Then walking in the rain will.

Deacon Blue,"For Oscar Marzaroli 1933 - 1988

Take me to the place where your heart hurts most
Lead me through the dark world gates down there
Where all the ghosts of sorrow and pain
And fear and despair stay hiding
And we'll walk right through to our own way, our own place

There's a beach that I walk so long and so broad
Oceans away miles longer than pain
In my glad dreams, I take you there, and it's easy
Because the work and the hours
And the pay are far behind our sure steps

My heart longs to be next to you
My heart want's to be there, be there with you
Where it's warm and tender and mercy flows like a river
And there you stand with your wide open hands
And say abide with me

And you you will be loved again

After the sausages and cream of the barley
There was a frame or two to be had at the ""imperial"" on mitchell street

He`d been wearing a green parka and he`d bought her yellow stilettos
That squeezed her toes
He`d told her the whole story as she took him into the wee penn behind sloan`s
And let him feel her all over

Deacon Blue,"Lily love that's a
Beautiful name
Your precious gifts are not the same
Since they faded away
The song so distant
But it still rings true your
Beautiful hands were rudely used
To make things pay
Every minute of every day
You don't get angry `bout what`s taken away
Is only real life
Every second of eternal light
Piercing through this sorrowful night
Will bring the sad heart
The cold heart
To love again
Last night I dreamed of
Henry Thomas in the
Delta light his rusty pipes
They drifted away
Standing in some
Dusty patch
It felt so close that I could almost catch
His breath on me
Every minute of every day
You don't get angry `bout what`s been taken away
Is only real life
Every second of eternal light
Piercing through this sorrowful night
Will make the sad heart
The cold heart
To love again
Every minute of every day
You don't get angry `bout what`s been taken away
Is only real life
Every second of eternal light
Piercing through this sorrowful night
Will make the sad heart

Deacon Blue,"I think I'm goin' back
To the things I learned so well in my youth,
I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth

Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time,
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality,
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left
So catch me if you can
I'm goin' back

I can recall,
I can remember

I can recall,
I can remember

I can recall,
I can remember",Goin' Back [Live]
Deacon Blue,"I hear the music coming out of the radio
Are you there with another girl
Instead of me
I hear your laughter and there's something I've got to know
Are you there with another girl
Instead of me

I'm standing on your doorstep and I don't know what to do
Should I ring your door bell or just walk away
My friends all say you were never true
(hiding in the shadows)

I see two silhouettes at the back of your window shield
Are you there with another girl
When I am gone
I can't believe you'd break the promises that you made
If your there with another girl I can't go on

I only know I love you I couldn't say why
So if there's another I don't want to know
If you should go I would surely die

Love requires faith I've got a lot of faith but
I hear the music coming out of your radio
I only know I love you I couldn't say why
So if there's another I don't want to know
If you should go I would surely die

You would never leave me hurt me or deceive me
I'm a fool to doubt you worry so about you
Love requires faith I've got a lot of faith but

I hear the music coming out of the radio
Hmmn yeah, I hear the music , coming out of your radio
The sweet sweet music
And your there with another girl

Deacon Blue,"I have an old friend
So the story goes
He never calls without saying hello

So the story goes
He says it`s it`s funny to see you look so low
I said I`m on top of the hill
Looking down at the Kings of the Western World

I went out and caught the train home
Looked at the land so the story goes
They`ve got factories and jobs and playground provided
And the workers are willing so the story goes

Is saying so much more than

Well it takes my breath away

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

Deacon Blue,"A cautious smile under the western sky
Would curl upwards like the wild sea
A special friend knowing all the ways of love
Would talk his way back inside a tiny second

Don't promise good intention
One in a thousand (maybe even me)
Don't know there are clouds in the sky
Sooner or later everyone will say the same thing

Baby, you already know
That all I want is to be with you
Call me over sooner
Call me right now

I'm standing underneath the blackest rolling sky
I don't know my way forward
I'm dizzy with the wind
Turning like a compass never true only spinning

All I want is to be with you
In the sad and lonely pines
Where no midday sun ever shines
As the clouds all float into thin air

Underneath the blackest sky somewhere
I hear the soul of man never dies
I hear that special will survive
Keeping time over the rolling roads

Staying with me as my thoughts all go
Chasing away in the green fields
Where every breath gives up and yields
To all I want",All I Want
Deacon Blue,"Love hurts, love scars, love wounds and mars
Any heart not tough nor strong enough
To take a lot of pain, take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud holds a lot of rain
Love hurts, ooh, ooh, love hurts
I'm young I know but even so
I know a thing or two I learned from you
I really learned a lot, really learned a lot
Love is like a stove burns you when it's hot
Love hurts, mmm, mmm, love hurts
Some fools dream of happiness
Blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves I guess
But they're not fooling me
I know it isn't true, know it isn't true
Love is just a lie made to make you blue
Love hurts, ooh, ooh, love hurts",Love Hurts
Deacon Blue,"Alan doesn't understand her
He only thinks in numbers
He only drinks in restaurants
Where the girls are fully covered

And he can't trust his yearnings
And he doesn't like pretending
His tempers stretched so much by work
His heart needs gentle rending

He calls her the chocolate girl
Cause he thinks she melts when he touches her
She knows she's the chocolate girl
Cause she's broken up and swallowed
And wrapped in bits of silver

Alan doesn't understand this
He says he's only human
So he still lights up with old flames
As if to try and prove it

And he doesn't like emotion
He's not certain of their ardor
If pouting causes so much fun
Then breaking hearts is harder

He calls her the chocolate girl
Cause he thinks she melts when he touches her
She knows she's the chocolate girl
Cause she's broken up and swallowed
And wrapped in bits of silver

Alan doesn't understand her
He thinks it's getting harder
So he spends the night with old friends
Underneath the covers

And he talks about the chocolate girl
And how he thinks she melts when he touches her
And that she knows she's the chocolate girl
Cause she's broken up and swallowed
And wrapped in bits of silver

And he calls her the chocolate girl
Cause he thinks she melts when he touches her
And she knows she's the chocolate girl
Cause she's broken up and swallowed
And wrapped in bits of silver",Chocolate Girl
Deacon Blue,"I will love you when the morning is ascending
I will love you when the moon is riding high
I will love you when we only have pretending
When our home becomes a cover from the sky
Well my eyes have seen the dust and then the ashes
And the lowland and white sky of your home
And the rain that washed mascara from my lashes
And nothing gave us cover from the sky
When you`re gone I notice all your tiny touches
And it`s then that I see it's then that I know why
If the days become the walls you never wanted
Our years will give us cover from the sky
From the sky
Well we've been among the saints and the angels
And we don`t want to wait until we die
So we`ll stand among the ruins of our temples
And pray to god for cover from the sky",Cover from the Sky

He's a worker for the council
Has been twenty years
And he takes no lip of nobody
And litter off the gutter
Puts it in a bag
And never sthinks to mutter
And he packs his lunch in a sunblest bag
The children call him bogie
He never lets on
But I know 'cause he once told me
He let me know a secret about the money in his kitty
He's gonna buy a dinghy
Gonna call her dignity

And I'll sail her up the west coast
Through villages and towns
I'll be on my holidays
They'll be doing their rounds
They'll ask me how I got her I'll say ""I saved my money""
They'll say isn't she pretty that ship called dignity

And I'm telling this story
In a faraway scene
Sipping down raki
And reading maynard keynes
And I'm thinking about home and all that means
And a place in the winter for dignity
And I'll sail her up the west coast
Through villages and towns
I'll be on my holidays

Deacon Blue,"Way out there in the wilderness
Of love and pain
Under the gentle arches we rode
The silver streets
Couldn`t see a difference between gold or
Wooden cross
Could never see where we`re falling
Came in to love

Then hounded by love
Hounded by the very thing you dreamed up
Chased inside the walls you tried to breach
Sent crashing to your knees
Only tender love
Understood the need you need with
Understood the time it took
To take you where nothing ever was

Never was there once nothing
And everything once was
Not dead but still and ready to be born anew
Looking back now it all
Seems so clear
Like staring so long unseeing for someone to light inside a
Darkened room

Then try your tender love
Push you back till there`s nowhere left
Nowhere to feel nothing anymore
Nothing that will comfort you more
More than tender love
Understands the need you need with
Understand the time it takes to get home and have a love again

More than tender love
Understands the need you need with
Understand the time it takes
To get home and have a love

Arm and arm in sheltered Kelvin way
Talking and tripping and teasing
And heading for the best part of the day

Falls softly on my pillow
No fear will make you cry or turn you grey

Stranger than the strangest beasts
Than ever can be

That your breath will stop
And this world will carry on

Crawling through the undergrowth
Stand by the railing
And look along
Put your ear to the ground
Listen for a while
Till all the tracks start
Humming and buzzing

And it's louder than the drums
'Cause it's tons and tons and tons
Of steel going faster

Now maybe I'm on the bridge
And near the very edge
And I'm waiting for the train
To pass under
It's got fifteen carriages

Now looking dandy stepping out Saturday
I can still see the buses
Lined up to take the dancing home

Kidding on but knowing that one day he planned
To leave all that behind

Now the time has come and the cleansing's coming
You're turning down the lights
In this cruel light symbols mean nothing

You're taking down the signs
Turning round your eyes
From dreams that seem so bright
Flying hope like kites
Hold loved ones tight
And turning to the light of that long window to love

And you forget about the years
About the planting and the dying and the growing
And you forget about your cares
But you remember that they've been forgotten
By the people sent to London

They're taking down your cares
Drinking off your tears
Gambling on your fears
For things that cost so dear
And won't be paid for years
Hoping you won't stare down that long window to love

They'd burgle all your sanity if it would let them hold you under
They'd knock on your door so hard the frame would crack under the strain
Its just the same ,just the same, Its just the same ,just the same

You're taking down the signs
Now the time has come and the cleansing's coming
You're turning down the lights

Flying hope like kites
Hold loved ones tight

To take the fight

I'm human too

It's cold and it's piercing
Again and again, you slip, you slip, you slip

Take a moment breathe in breathe out

Into words!

That you've killed, you've killed, you've killed
Disintegrates you from inside, don't need no sympathy
All If I manage to stay alive, alive, alive
I'll walk out of this with pride

Stop the clock and the hands of time
Take a moment breathe in breathe out
Everything is gonna be just fine

From 10 years of silence, I'm now breaking new ground
From a closed space of vacuum, I'm now starting to breathe
Take nothing for granted, that's what I have learned
That's what I have learned, that's what I have learned

Where the oppressor ruled with an iron hand, and of nations who sat in complacency left cold and emotionless by history.

Scenes of pain and cruelty were there to be seen
And all the while I should have known
It was you killing me.
Somewhere east of eden the designs will never change.

Infected through others fear the world stops at the end of the hall.
We watched the life force fade away.
The eventual price you will have to pay.

Dead Can Dance,"From ancient times to the present day
There have been those who have claimed her as a lover.
So driven by the will to move up
Have pursued her to the very ends of the earth.

She enters into it enters into us.
As the wheel spins and turns the fortunate ones are seen to emerge.
She enters into it enters into us.
Fortune smiles upon our heads.

Mistakenly we cling to her warm embrace.
How easily we seem to forgive and forget
Lost within the security of our new found wealth.
There are those of you amongst us

Bearing vacant faces and empty smiles.
Their fates have already been decided upon.
They will leave behind them only victims of their misplaced trust.
Fortune smiles upon our heads.

Mistakenly we cling to her warm embrace.
How easily we seem to forgive and forget
When lost in the security of our new found wealth.",Fortune
Dead Can Dance,"These silent chances pass one by
Who never knew of them at all.
Resigned to the hands of fate
We await her impending beck and call.

Until we return, paradise interred.
Spread your golden wings, et the sails unfurl.
These silent chances pass one by
Who never knew of them at all.

Resigned to the hands of fate
We await her impending beck and call.
Until we return, paradise interred.
Spread your golden wings, let the fires burn.

Well opportunities doors did not open wide.
The answers remain locked away inside.
So forced into labour we till the earth
To sow the seeds of our own rebirth.

As the days turned into years
Our faith overcame any doubts or fears.
Are there any doubts or fears?
In truth we had found the key.

It's application would unravel this mystery.",A Passage in Time

Dead Can Dance,"All my senses rebel
Under the scrutiny of their persistent gaze.
It took a lifetime to get here,
A journey I'll never make again.

For those who have accepted the burden of shame.
For the innocent only guilt will remain
And our lives will be forced to accommodate
The perpetrators of our own bastard race.

All my senses rebel
Under the scrutiny of their persistent gaze.
It took a lifetime to get here,
A journey I'll never make again.

I stand accused of a thousand and one crimes.
A witness to events that led up to this present time.
These traditions, which bind our hands and keep us tied,
Will never survive the greater test of time.

Deliver me from these feverish eyes
That threaten to unbalance my state of mind.
For I must confess only to the smallest of crimes.
A sense of guilt.",The Trial
Dead Can Dance,"Wild in the woods of love
We harm those whom we adore
And contrary to all good intentions
We suffocate them in an alarming embrace.
Listen child, try to understand,
All is not what it appears to be in the world at hand.
Here dreams are bought and sold for a price.
The truth a burden to keep for the rest of your life.
These paths that have been chosen

Can only lead to fear and despair.
So we learn from and experience the corporeal.
All is hidden in hidden meanings.
All can be learned from within.
We are all brothers and sisters in spirit.
Wild in the woods of love
We harm those whom we adore
And contrary to all good intentions
We suffocate them in an alarming embrace.",Wild in the Woods
Dead Can Dance,"In the hour of darkness our worlds collide.
Assailed by a madness that has plagued our lives.
At the point of departure on the eve despair'
No recourse to reason seems to make any sense at all.

The light of hope shines in your eyes.
Dementia has gone, purged from inside.
Throughout our wanderings in a land of lies.
We fell from gods grace into a sea of storms.

In self renovation, celebration of love.
These both are virtues we seem to have left behind.
The light of hope shines in your eyes.
Dementia has gone purged from inside.

Lay down your heart. Induce the will of love.
To restore what little faith that you may have lost.
As morning brings rebirth a new day will dawn to ease our troubled minds.
Turn away on your side and dream of days to come.",Advent
Dead Can Dance,"Sail to the stars on your shining desires.
""Reasons? there are none"" cried the whisky laden brain.
""When all is said and done it amounts to just the same"".
There in your starry eyes lie hopes that have been betrayed.

The cause of your desire can also lead to your demise.
When all is said and done it will be you who pays the price
As countless fools are often loathe to testify 
""It's an illusion of life, the whole cause of our demise"".

Sail to the stars on your shining desires.
Lucretia waits in vain for the child of her dreams.
Within her aching womb there burns a funeral pyre.
There in your starry eyes lie hopes that have been betrayed.

The prize that you claim can never be yours to take
Like castles in Spain, hope is all that will remain.
Abstain from the fools paradise, it's an illusion of life, the whole cause of our demise.
Fools are often loathe to testify ""it's an illusion of life, the whole cause of our demise"".

Contemplate the world and it's traitors to the soul.
The forces of derision and their legions manifold.
Usurpers of the crown, all pretenders to the throne,
Your world is linked in chains ""All in one, One in all"".",The Cardinal Sin

Dead Can Dance,"Saloman hung down her head
Laid bare her heart for the world to see.
She craved for intimacy.
Through darkened doors her aspect veiled with indecision, gazed out sea.

She craved lucidity.
Cast adrift from past relationships in her life,
Hoisted up the ideal. This was her saving grace.
Seas of rage that once assailed her concern for the truth

Had passed her by and left her high and dry in her saviours arms.
Across the sea lies the fountain of renewal,
Where you will find the whole cause of your loneliness
Can be measured in dreams that transcend all these lies
And I wish and I pray that there may come a day for a saviours arms.",Enigma of the Absolute
Dead Can Dance,"In times of great vexation when one must choose between what's right and wrong
Freedom, so they say, amounts to the choices you have made.
Through all the arbitrary rationale concerning liberty.
Freedom, I must say, exists within unconditioned minds.

Reason has come of age.
How can you be satisfied with things the way they are,
When all that surrounds us now and so much more remains inside the keeper's dark embrace.
The insatiable thirst for power has made;

Idols out of mortals,
Gods into clay,
Soldiers into heroes,
Children into slaves of damned desire,

Their hopes betrayed.

Remain in light, renounce all fears.
For you have been mesmerized.
Break this spell of silence.",Mesmerism
Dead Can Dance,"We scale the face of reason 
To find at least one sign
That could reveal the true dimension
Of life, lest we forget.
And maybe it's easier to withdraw from life
With all of its misery and wretched lies
Away from harm

We lay by cool, still waters
And gazed into the sun
And like the moth's great imperfection
Succumbed to her fatal charms
And maybe it's me who dreams of requited love
The victim of fools who stand in line.
Away from harm.

Will this crooked path ever cease to end?",Anywhere out of the World
Dead Can Dance,"Hey Patrice don't cry they've no reason to harm you at all
They don't realize that the angels surround you with light
They don't understand their narrow ways defeat them where they stand
They don't realize you hide your sadness beneath a painted smile

Ignorance, that blind old fool who steers a wayward path
Has set the course on which we sail into a night of uncertainty
Following the stars that make their way across the sky
Valuing the love that lends grace to our hearts
We sail",In the Wake of Adversity
Dead Can Dance,"Fair Rosanna your vagrancy's a familiar tale.
Fraught with danger, the lives you led were judged profane.

Fate, although Xavier has prayed that life giving waters may rain
Down on the souls of men to cure them of their ways.
These were the sins of Xavier's past, hung like jewels in the forest of veils.
Deep in the heart where the mysteries emerge

Eve bears the stigma of original sin.
Freedom's so hard, when we are all bound by laws
Etched in the scheme of natures own hand, unseen by all those who fail
In their pursuit of fate.

Although Xavier has prayed that life giving waters may rain
Down on the souls of men to cure them of their ways.
And as the night turns into day will the sun illuminate your way,
Or will your nightmares come home to stay.

Dark shadows overwhelm us and we become blind.
Blind to the needs of those who would be free
