Jake Owen,"City of angels, city of stars
She shine brightest stone on that boulevard
She introduced me to Jackson Brown
Convertible rode me all over that town
Oh, my LAX

She always carried a Polaroid camera
She always had that cold act glamour
Well, she moved out there to chase her dream
To be an actress on that silver screen
Oh, my LAX

Dear seventeen degrees and sunny    
Please hold tight to my California honey
Make her famous with lots of money
And tell her I wish her all the best
Oh, my LAX

Night trampoline and marijuana
I close my eyes and I can smell it on her
Boarded in a plane back to Tennessee
I wonder if she's ever gonna think about me

Well, dear palm trees and palm readers
Tattoo artist and make believers
Please tell her next time you see her
That I sure wish her all the best
Oh, my LAX
Oh, my LAX",LAX
Jake Owen,"A bag of beef jerky sitting on a road map
Dashboard hula girl shaking her grass
Shotgun DJ, navigate the airwaves
Don't know where we're going or when we're coming back

Who wants to ride? Who wants to roll?
Westbound, southbound, where the wind blows
Who needs a plan? Bring the whole fam
Load 'em all up in my VW van (V-dub, VW)
Yeah, who wants to ride my VW van? (V-dub, VW)

On the road again, just like Willy
Free old hillbilly gypsy soul
Gonna run out to Idaho
But I don't know, baby, ready, set, go

Load 'em all up in my VW van (V-dub, VW)
Yeah, who wants to ride my VW van? (V-dub, VW)

When it gets dark, we'll put it in park
And turn on them party lights
A lawn chair sipping on Cuervo gold
Hell, we might even make Mexico

Jake Owen,"It sounds like a lie when you say it
Sounds like a lie 'cause it is
It don't matter how you try to play it
It don't matter which way it spins
It ain't rocket science, baby
It ain't arithmetic

When you love someone
When you really love someone
You don't get drunk at a bar, jump in the car
Roll in the dark and go to far with someone
When you love someone

Well, I'm coming down off a promise
You're coming down off a buzz
Whether it's love or it's whiskey
Well, I guess we've both sobered up
Let's just go ahead and call this thing what it was

'Cause when you love someone
When you really love someone
You don't get drunk at a bar, jump in the car
Roll in the dark and go to far with someone
When you love someone

Oh, don't wanna hear you're sorry
Oh, baby, don't waste your breath
'Cause it sounds like a lie when you say it
It sounds like a lie cause it is

When you love someone
When you really love someone
You don't get drunk at a bar, jump in the car
Roll in the dark

Get you all tangled up in your mind
Make you wanna just disappear

Jake Owen,"Put a hundred thousand miles on this Bronco
Running, gunning, flying up and down the gulf coast
Climbed a mile-high Colorado rock
Trying to leave our love at the top, at the top, girl
Tried to lose you in a New York city skyline
Wrote you away (?)Vegas table, let it all ride
I've been going every place there is
To let this love go like you did

I'm going out of my mind, going out on a limb
Going out on the town with all my friends
I tried a new girl, new look, a new town
I didn't get it when you said you'd always stick around
You're out in a crown in the dark of the night
Saying you'd never leave, you've never been so right
See you in a blue sky, breathe you in the night air
Girl, you're always right there, you ain't going nowhere
You ain't going nowhere

Usually time will patch up all this pain I'm feeling
But I ain't forgetting nothing, I ain't healing
I guess it's true that a heart, it don't break even
I thought you were leaving

I'm going out of my mind, going out on a limb
Going out on the town with all my friends
I tried a new girl, new look, a new town
I didn't get it when you said you'd always stick around
You're out in a crown in the dark of the night
Saying you'd never leave, you've never been so right
See you in a blue sky, breathe you in the night air
Girl, you're always right there, you ain't going nowhere
You ain't going nowhere

I'm going crazy, baby, I'm going down
It's like we're the last two left in a ghost town

I'm going out of my mind, going out on a limb
Going out on the town with all my friends
I tried a new girl, new look, a new town
I didn't get it when you said you'd always stick around

Jake Reichbart,"Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me
Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last
Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me
Long the skies were overcast

Jake Reichbart,"Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again.
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Taking a Chance on Love
Jake Shimabukuro,"I wouldn't change a thing about you
I wouldn't ask the green to be blue
I wouldn't ask the birds not to fly
Or change a thing in the sky
Or turn hello to goodbye

I wouldn't ask the birds not to sing
I wouldn't ask the phone not to ring
I just couldn't ask the wind not to blow

Or a boat not to row
Or a trio to go solo

You are amazing just as you are
You're a flower in the spring
You're the light each morning brings
And I adore you just where you are
You're not the star that I wish on
You're the wish on my star",Wish on My Star
Jake Shimabukuro,"When I perform, right?
I'm gonna actually bring a toaster
To the performance, onstage
Plug it in, and I'm gonna bring a loaf of bread
And in between songs, I'm gonna make toast
And I'm gonna eat it
And then I'll offer it to the audience if anybody wants
And so people come and watch me play

And they see me with this toaster, making toast
They'll be like, ""He's up there, right?
Dancing around like a maniac
And he's making toast!""
To me, it's just like,
Quiet, everybody makes toast.",Toastmaker's Revenge
Jake Shimabukuro,"Why do birds suddenly appear?
Every time you are near
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

Why do stars fall down from the sky?
Every time you walk by
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born
And the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true

So they sprinkled moon dust
In your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue
That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born
And the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true

So they sprinkled moon dust
In your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue

Follow you all around

Close to you
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you",(They Long to Be) Close to You
Jake Shimabukuro,"Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love",Misty
Jake Shimabukuro,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere","Here, There and Everywhere"
Jake Shimabukuro,"There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more 

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more",In My Life
Jake Simpson,"Isn't she lovely 
Isn't she wonderful 
Isn't she precious 
Less than one minute old 
I never thought through love we'd be 
Making one as lovely as she 
But isn't she lovely made from love 
Isn't she pretty 
Truly the angel's best 
Boy, I'm so happy 
We have been heaven blessed 
I can't believe what God has done 
Through us he's given life to one 
But isn't she lovely made from love

Jake Simpson,"Like a fool I went and stayed too long
Now I'm wondering if your love's still strong
Oo, baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!

That I really didn't mean, didn't I?

When I touch them, they mean nothing, girl

But I can't hold the hurt inside, keep the pain out of my eyes anymore
My tears no longer waiting, my resistance ain't that strong
And my mind keeps recreating a life with you alone

Let me make one last appeal just to show you how I feel about you
'Cause there's no one else I swear that holds a candle anywhere next to you
My heart can't take the beating, not having you to hold
And yeah a small voice keeps repeating deep inside my soul
It says I can't keep pretending that I don't love you anymore

Or an old brown paper sack
Pack it light or pack it heavy
Take a truck, take a Chevy
Baby just come back

There's a shortcut
To the highway out of town
Oh, why don't you take it?
Don't let that speed limit slow you down
Go on and break it

Lean on the gas and off the clutch
Leave Dallas in the dust

Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright

Of paradise, where roses grew

And the evenings are cold enough to pluck your feathers out

We've long outlasted the winter and our last wood pile

Too many people running loose in the mind

You would be blind if you only knew
It was eye for an eye and truth for truth

Pack up your wagon girl and button your coat
Look up and see me coming out of the smoke
Footprints of angels leaving tracks in the snow
I'm the last man that sweetheart you oughta know

When it's eye for an eye and truth for a truth
Here I lie, my arms around you
You would be blind if you only knew

The apple of somebody's eye
Ain't nothing so pretty in this terrible light
All hands on deck and all men to the tower
I'm a virtue-less man in the midnight hour

Now it's junk on junk, this bed that we made
Where I sleep like a horse standing up on the clay
Got to be ready, there's so much hell to pay
And I'm guilty of loving you in the worse kind of way

Here I lie, my arms around you
You would be blind if you only knew

Plus d'une fois la musique
M'a laissé sans voix
Elle est là dès que je suis triste
C'est ma seule échappatoire
Elle me guérit, me donne l'énergie
Je m'évade quand elle me parle
Elle est ma devise dans la vie

Je puise dans mon passé
Et mes connaissances
J'ai trouvé comment échanger
Mes idées mes expériences
C'est quand j'écris, que j'exorcise
Mes peurs, mes erreurs

Je n'peux l'imaginer hors de ma vie

Attendant calmement que mon heure arrive
Au-delà des peines
J'ai tout donné pour arriver jusqu'ici
A présent je fais
Un pas de plus pour réaliser mes rêves

Couplet 2

Elle pourrait s'écouter
En toute circonstance
A tout âge elle nous fait vibrer
Elle nous met parfois en transe
C'est dans la nuit, oh, qu'elle nous séduit
Elle est là dans nos ébats
Pour que l'harmonie se dessine

Certaines ont le pouvoir
D'éveiller les consciences
D'autres font parties de l'histoire
Au-delà des différences
Elle nous unit, nous épanouie
C'est elle, qui nous guide

La musique fait battre mon c?ur
Une voix qui vient de l'intérieur
Je suis avec elle à toute heure
C'est mon âme s?ur

Mon dieu que c'est lâche
Que c'est fâcheux
Quelle tragédie, quel tracas
Mon dieu que c'est vache
Mon amoureux est reparti là bas
Mon dieu que c'est triste
Il m'aimait si peu
Moi je l'aimais tant, je crois
Mon dieu tu t'en fiches
Toi tu n'as d'yeux
Que pour une autre que moi
Même si le temps passe
Je n'oublie pas

C'est ennuyeux
Tu t'es joué de moi
Mon dieu que c'est cloche
De se dire adieu
Et Paris est si froid
Mon dieu si tu existes même un peu
Ramène-moi

Si vaniteux
Qui ne peignait que moi
Même si le temps passe

Life can't be that way,to wake me then break me

Jaleo,"Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah, ah

Follow her down to a bridge by the fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high.

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds 
And you're gone.

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.",Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds

And challenged me then and there to a drag

I said ""You're on buddy -- my mill's running fine
Let's come off the line now at Sunset and Vine
But I'll go you one better, if you've got the nerve
Let's race all the way -- to Dead Man's Curve""

Remain to love until they droop and die

Feel the vibrate as we turn up the bass,
Fell th treble make you when you could bring it on,
(I'd like) to see you if we could bring it on,
(And I would like) to see if we could get it on,
(I'd like) to see if I could turn it out,
You know what I'm about,
So shake that ass and let me hear you shout

Chorus x2

Rap:
Let me see ya bounce boy, do ya thing
Show me sutturn, make me swing,
It's O.K to let yourself go,
It's O.K as long as you know,
It's about to go off in here,
Let me show you who's the boss up in here,
Shake ya thang 'cause you don't care,
I get it hot like Montego Bay up in here,
Bounce bounce, I know you heard me,
Come on we about to get dirty,
Forget tome it's never too early,
Don't nothing matter when we,
Bounce, to the break of dawn,
Getting our freak on,
You want it bad, and then there ain't damn thing wrong

Wanting to spend your life with me
Why couldn't you just talk to me

She's whore and will go where I won't

Stand here with this ring on my finger
Is it nothing but you're just another confused

Lonely don't wanna make you feel good

Never let that lonely capture you,
Always know that I'm here for you.

Lonely don't want you next to me,
Lonely doesn't wanna make a compromise,

Never forget that you can call on me.

I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby don't you recognise me?
Well it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

With a note saying ""I Love You"" I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now I know you'd fool me again

I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God I thought you were someone to rely on

A face on a lover with a fire in her heart
A man undercover but you tore me apart
Oooh Oooh

You better stop (stop)
Before you go and break my heart
Ooooh oooh oooh you better stop

Time after time I tried to walk away
But its not that easy,
When you soul is torn in two
So I just resigned myself to it everyday yeh
And now all that I can do is to leave it up to you aah oooh

Ooh whoa oh
You better stop (stop)
Before you tear me apart
You better stop (stop)
Before you go and break my heart
Ooooh oooh oooh you better stop

Ohh ooh whoa you better stop
If you love me
Now the time to be sorry
I won't believe that you'd walk out on me baby
Ohhh yehhh

Before you tear me apart
You better stop (stop)
Before you go and break my heart

Jamelia,"When your only friends are hotel rooms
Hands are distant lullabies
If I could turn around I would tonight

These roads never seemed so long
Since your paper heart start beating leaving me suddenly alone
Will daybreak ever come?

Who's gonna call on Sunday morning?
Who's gonna drive you home?
I just want one more chance
To put my arms in fragile hands

I thought you said forever
Over and over
A sleepless night becomes bitter oblivion

These thoughts run through my head
Over and over
Complaints of violins become my only friends

August evenings
Bring solemn warnings
To remember to kiss the ones you love goodnight

You never know what temporal days may bring
So laugh, love, live free and sing
When life is in discord
Praise ye the lord

Who's gonna call on Sunday morning?
Who's gonna drive you home?
I just want one more chance
To put my arms in fragile hands

Displaying qualities that you never existed
Coming in from every corner
That'll get you twisted
Got you wide open

Only one girl can make a player not a play
And only one girl can make a bad boy stay
With only one girl the light you will see
But I bet you never knew that girl was me

I stepped into the room and I
Saw that look you can't deny it baby now
You've been took now honey it ain't all about 
What I got 'cause I guarantee that sugar 
I'll get you hot

That I can`t concentrate on my sorrow
Let down my hair and find something to wear
And then dance myself into tomorrow

Are these grey walls that are closing in on me
Throw me a ladder, lend me an arm
Beam me up Scotty, lift me from harm

Oh I love my holes
Black hole

If the weather would change these clouds might blow away
And my body'd be wrapped up in sunshine

If it's bent or straight
All I know is I've found something that will take me home again

Search with an open heart
You'll be sure to find your answers, penetrate the scream in the cynics

No sooner alive than I'm being attacked

I don't want that poison in

I took a sip, a taste I didn't understand
The woman then explained, that this was the juice, the juice that causes pain
That all great singers need

James,"She grabs her magazines
She packs her things and she goes
She leaves the pictures hanging on the wall, she burns all
Her notes and she knows, she's been here too few years
To feel this old

He smokes his cigarette, he stays outside 'til it's gone
If anybody ever had a heart, he wouldn't be alone
He knows, she's been here too few years to be gone

And we always say, it would be good to go away someday
But if there's nothing there to make things change
If it's the same for you I'll just hang

The trouble understand, is she got reasons he don't
Funny how he couldn't see it at all 'til she grabbed up her coat
And she goes, she's been here too few years to take it all in stride
But still it's much too long, to let hurt go (you let her go)

And we always say, it would be good to go away, someday
But if there's nothing there to make things change
If it's the same for you I'll just hang
The same for you
I'll always hang

Well I always say, it would be good to go away

Go walkabout, I've got the bends from pressure

Call what he does a sin if it makes you feel better

And I can't believe you're all I'll ever need
And I need to feel that you're not holding me
And the way I feel just makes me want to scream
Come home, come home, come home
Come home, come home, come home

After thirty years I've become my fears
I've become the kind of man I always hated
I am pulled apart, and my swollen heart
Has flipped out of the pan into the fire
I am in love insane with a sense of shame
That I threw stones at the condemned and
Now I'm slated

And I don't believe you're all I'll ever need

After damning me and you to Hell for eternity

They bribe their way past Heaven's gates and steal a set of keys

I speak in the name of that White Haired
Old Man in the clouds, always a man
Dispensing lightening justice from His fingertips
Watching you every second of the day
Just waiting for you to fuck up

I speak in the name of God
I'm His intermediary
I'm a Mollah, I'm a Priest, I'm a Vicar
If you want to go to God
You have to come through me
Because my God is bigger than your God
My God is bigger than your God
My God is the only way

Is Heaven full, oh Lord, of these babbling preachers
All these self-righteous, self-appointed prophets
Because if so, I know where I'd rather be

Don't go out with that smile tonight or you might get arrested
Get a license for that grin or they'll lock you away
If you show that you're happy inside then you're gonna get busted
The only law we allow around here is an organized raid

How many words will you waste on the telephone

I've been training my lens on the stars to see where it ends

I've never met a prophet whose sheets are clean 
Only in a film could he be so cool 
But only in life can fathers be so cruel

You send your children off to war 

As if you care, as if you care 
To live the love of life, to live your love of life 
To live your love of life, your love of life 
Your love of life 

Prophets have been sacrificed for common good 
What we want slugs it out with what we should 
All of these commercials are just teasing greed 
Everybody's restless with a deeper need 
Open your eyes, and what do you see 
A system made to crush our needs 
A saviour nailed to every tree 

As if you care, as if you care

To live the love of life, to live your love of life 
To live your love of life, your love of life

To slide under and into and inside

Slammed your fingers in the door

And the gap between crack and thunder
Crack and thunder
Is closing in

The rain floods gutters
And makes a great sound on concrete

On a flat roof, there's a boy
Leaning against a wall of rain
Aerial held high
Calling ""Come on thunder,
Come on thunder!""

Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes I swear I can see your soul
Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes I swear I can see your soul

It's a monsoon!
And the rain lifts lids off cars
Spinning buses like toys
Stripping them to chrome
Across the bay, the waves are something else
Picking up fishing boats and spewing them on the shore

The boy's hit!
Lit up against the sky
Like a sign
Like a neon sign

Then he crumples
Drops into the gutter
Cut strings
Legs twitching

The flood swells his clothes
Delivers him on
Delivers him on

Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes I swear I can see your soul
Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes I swear I can see your soul

There's four new colours in the rainbow
An old man's taking Polaroids
But all he catches
Is endless rain
Endless rain
Endless rain

He says, ""Listen!""
Takes my head
Puts my ear to his
And I swear I can hear the sea

James,"She dreampt the scene the night before
She cast you in her mind
She made your face of clay and straw
Precious stones for your eyes
We cut the cord that brought you here
We left you on your own
We filled your head with wild ideas
Our beliefs led you on
We leave a trail that's always changed
To keep your hopes alive
This surface may seem calm enough, but underneath
But underneath
We made you feel the way you are is wrong
We made you what you are
You are afraid
If you don't play the game we'll make you change

Faces I forget, hotels all look the same
Worn down the knuckle too far
So long, so long

Lost are your colors, now life's in black and white
Steals from a movie, this life's a trick of the light
Worn down the knuckle too far
Worn down

City of strangers, you seem so tired to me
Don't think I'll stay here, you don't seem friendly
I'll keep on moving, searching for peace of mind
Rivers unwinding maybe I'll find it this time

Sleep in a strange bed, hometown's a foreign land

Gonna fuck with genes

There's a hole in my heart

That only money can make me happy
Hold the course and then sail

Across the oceans or seas

I'd sell my soul for a bond girl's kiss

Moving from shadow to shadow
Past the guards to the forest
So quiet in her still reflection
Drawing them down, drawing them down to the lake
To the center of her attention
Steal the moon tonight
Before the morning
Steal the moon tonight
I just love a good mystery
And on the West Bank a boat is being pulled 
Across the sands they move so softly
Slip into water
Oars dip, don't break the moon's reflection
And drift like a cloud
To the center
Beneath her cool attention
Still water
Still water
Steal the moon tonight
Before the morning

I've seen you rising from shore to shore
I want to drown in your moon dream

And he crumples, drops into the gutter, legs twitching
The flood swells his clothes and delivers him on, delivers him on

Everybody wants more money
Everybody wants more loving

Through the east and the west divide
The land between the trenches
Was patrolled by the deaf and the blind

While the deaf said, ?Can't you see??
Somewhere deep in no man's land
The man has lost a key

I open up into this mystery
I have seen
I have seen
I have seen

There's centuries of fighting
So I brought myself a gun
The salesman called it freedom
So my enemy bought a bigger one

I'm saving up for a missile
That will shoot him up with love
Now his finger's on my button
And my hand is in his glove

I opened up into this mystery
Every key can lock you up or set you free
I believe that there is magic
In this mystery

Everybody wants the same things

This woman's a saint, or at least she's a queen

Talons and wings and a cute 45

He's only human, he's only male
Bound to stray, bound to betrayal
The moon is rising, it's a physical thing
Nothing can hold him, not even the ring

She's only human, only female
Bound to victim, bound to betrayal
The moon is rising, it's a physical thing
She's only acting on the right of spring

Licking their beaks and they're talking about me

Feral kids fight over rats, tailed from gutters

Laughing and crying, his song fell upon us
We buried his treasure along with his bones

Innocent witness, he testified
Drained of his purpose, he falls off the quayside
Absorbed by the ocean, rolled by the tide

Under the freeway, now, mostly rubble
The hungry still gather to fill up with stories
Of monsters and heroes and men

Connect us to hope that perfection's within
Is here on the ground, we're reckless and hopeless
Damned by the slip of a pen

Moths in the moonlight, fooled by a flashlight
Caught in a jam jar, gasping for air

James,"Move down south
Get it
Wells dried out
Desert
Taps turned off
My mind's cloudy with heat
The weather blues

Lights gone out
Dammit
Paid my dues
At least stars are out
A glob of fat on spoon
A fat full moon

Came across this ghost town to the west
Every house was looted, left for dead
Crow, Coyote circling (what's left)
No snow capped mountains, wells as dry as tombs

Farmers drilled down past the riverbed
Pulled up rare and ancient species
Trees are gnarled to ghostly shapes
Limbs beetle dead make monstrous silhouettes

We're all walking south
Unforgiving
Now the fire's gone out
Never waste a breath
We're all moving south
Regrets

Pray this weather cycles
Pray and dance for rain
Faith in moving mountains
Faith died on the plains
Land is parched and burning
Jump the fire lanes

Too late we're all responsible
Too late to hold a wake
We're all drilled out

Move down south
Get it
All drilled out
Headed
New World
I'm hysterical
Life is freaking me out

Love comes to heal the broken
Her house is always open
Open house no one denied
This baby's come
To blow our minds

James,"Nothing but love gives the world some meaning
Nothing but love is the drug of Healing
Lover be soft, lover be bold 
Earthquake, avalanche, volcano

Nothing but love
I've got nothing but love

Nothing but love stops the mind from grinding
Nothing but love flushes hearts from hiding
Deeper we dive, nowhere to hide 
Earthquake, avalanche and goodbye

Nothing but love fills the hole I'm hiding
Nothing but love from the well we're drinking 
Into the highs deal with the lows
Earthquake avalanche volcano

For all, love me now, I'll pay the cost

All these thoughts
Cascading over me
Can't make up my mind

Clearing the high bar
Hearing the crowd roar
Here comes, here comes, here comes
The swell, swell, swell
Cascading over me

Look into my eyes
Ones and noughts
Clouds of buzzing bees
Harlequins and clowns
Truth is slippery

Know that your love's right
Whatever your incline
Be the bright light
In the dark times
Clearing the high bar

I've hacked, your system from withing
You get what you put in
Some say these things I've, caught in the best for God

James Armani,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is
James Arthur,"Hmm

I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love, I did

And you were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot, I did

And now
When all is done, there is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won, you can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now

Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be impossible,
Impossible
Impossible
Impossible

Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worse
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know
And thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear
I know
I know and now

When all is done, there is nothing to say
And if you're done with embarrassing me
On your own you can go ahead tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops

I've been living there too long
Well, she never liked me anyway
'Cause she knows I'm nothing scum

Oh I, I tried so hard to change
But the devil locked my door
I'll wear these heavy chains around my neck like a prisoner
I just wanna love
But he won't let me go
Loosen up my chains, oh, I'm a condemned prisoner

I think my mind's on the blink
So I get high, so high and I drink
I suffered enough of the hard times when I think
Just covered it up, the fine line drinks in
Eh, now I'm at the disco, convinced the girls saying I'm the bizzo
'Course I'm on the brink
Looking at me funny, of course I'm gonna swing
Karaoke 'cause I wanna sing
Oh, pour me another drink
It always ends the same

Oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh
I'm a condemned prisoner

I tried so hard to change (I tried so hard to change)
But the devil locked my door (but the devil locked my door)

I just wanna love (I just wanna love) 
But he won't let me go (but he won't let me go)

James Arthur,"I know I hurt you, I was so unkind
I was ungrateful, I wasted your time
But I was young and lost, so lost
See, you took this poor boy and changed his whole life
Granted his wishes and dreams overnight
And I saw stars, they shot me down
But I deserved it, they knocked me out

I'm just waking up now, in the tears of the ones I love
It's quiet, I'll bet that everybody thinks I'm done
I need to get up now, I've been down here far too long
Two years I've been lost, now I remember who I was
Who I was, who I was

I am the one who beat me black and blue
No one can hurt all your feelings like you
Whoa, I know it, or validate
See, if you're a misfit and feel out of place
Or you don't like how you look, it's okay
'Cause someone will, but you need to love yourself
Don't end up like me, don't end up like me

Watched you changing in front of my eyes
What can I say?
Now that I'm not the fire in the cold
Now that I'm not the hand that you hold
As you're walking away

Will you call me to tell me you're alright?
'Cause I worry about you the whole night
Don't repeat my mistakes, I won't sleep 'til you're safe inside
If you're home I just hope that you're sober
Is it time to let go now you're older?
Don't leave me this way, I won't sleep 'til you're safe inside

Everyone has to find their own way
And I'm sure things will work out okay
I wish that was the truth
All we know is the sun will rise

There is nothing I can say that will change you anyway

James Arthur,"I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I know I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now
Oh, and you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me when I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise till death we part like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you, now everybody knows
'Cause now it's just you and me till we're grey and old

James Arthur,"You don't have to say you're sorry
Or redeem yourself to me, oh
I'm not asking for confessions

It's not a question that you are the one that I need

I never read the book though I knew the pages were turning
I tried to sing the hymns but I couldn't think of the verses
Tried to confess my sins, but I didn't know how to word it
But this is my sermon, 'fess that I'm emotionally drained
Self-medicating hoping I can cope with the pain
I need a face 'cause that'll fix whatever's broke in my brain
Who am I kidding, no, I'm going insane
I wrote some quotes on this page, just trying to reach, and I hope you were late
Well, I'll probably just throw them away
'Cause I don't know what to say
I feel weak when I'm supposed to be brave
I seem free but I'm enclosed in a cage
Though I continue to ponder over the plastic
And I ain't gonna do any better
Do I whimper from the future, and buckle under the pressure
Or do I step to the plate, and gon' take the chance with my life
And come face-to-face with the darkness so I can stand in the light, like?

When I feel your love upon me
I know that I am truly blessed
Sometimes we've gotta face the darkness
Just get me to the light again

And he crumples, drops into the gutter, legs twitching
The flood swells his clothes and delivers him on, delivers him on

In the town I grew up
Shelter from the rain in every doorway
It's dark and everyone's numb
Kids are making faces in the bus lane
But nobody looks up
Everyone's life the same as yesterday
Just like the ticking of clocks

And I'm craving, craving, craving something I can feel
Where do I go what do I need?
Is it ecstasy or is it fear?
Am I on my own am I even close?
'Cause I'm craving, still craving something I can feel

Never thought the night could get so lonely
'Til she called me up
Never thought these streets could've outgrown me
I guess it wasn't enough
So I put my faith in everyone around me
Then she sold all my stuff
Sheer and wild abandon, that's all I need
And someone I can trust

'Cause I'm craving, craving, craving something I can feel
Where do I go what do I need?
Is it ecstasy or is it fear?
Am I on my own am I even close?

Lead me out in the night
Don't show me the way back home

Invisible to these crowds, always double vision
I've been losing my mind listening to broken speech
Stacking up broken seats, it's a lonely picture

Always that same thing that you said

Get out, get out, while you still can
Don't let the nights slip through your hands

Making my tracks along the cracks in the coke
Seeing those headlights shining down upon my feet
If you find me, you will find me on the run
For all the bleeding hearts pushing 'round the stubborn cards
I've seen the green of glass, I've seen the faster cars
And I don't need your heavy hours
I don't need your lonely bars
I'm ejected like a bullet from a gun

Standing on the staircase, come and chase the master plan
Long way to get away, play it like a grand slam

When I don't think of you, the willpower
What I didn't see was I was talking to so many people at once
I had no idea I was
I had no idea of the difference between
The way I saw your face and the way it was

Because of a few songs

I remember laughing, to take that away from you
To take that away from you, I remember laughing
I remember laughing, to take that away from you
To take that away from you, I remember laughing
The smaller the waves, you let me down
The longer I will defend you
The smaller the waves, you let me down
The longer I will defend you (because of a few songs)

I couldn't let them out

How will I walk slow?

Beautiful dawn (beautiful dawn)- melt with the stars again
Do you remember the day when my journey began?
Will you remember the end (of time)?

Thought I was born to endless night, until you shine

We watched the sunset from my car
We all took it in

And if this is what we've got
Then what we've got is gold

James Blunt,"Billy's leaving today (don't know where he's going).
Holds his head in disgrace (he can't escape the truth).
He knows the price that he's paid.
He admits that it's too late to admit that he's afraid.

[Chorus]
Tomorrow comes, sorrow becomes his soul mate.
The damage is done. The prodigal son is too late.
Old doors are closed but he's always open,
To relive time in his mind.
Oh Billy.

Billy's leaving today (don't know where he's going).
He's got lines on his face (they tell the story of his pain).
He accepts it's his fate.
He admits it took too long to admit that he was wrong.

Once he was a lover sleeping with another.
Now he's just known as a cheat.
And he wish he'd had a mirror, looked a little clearer.
Seen into the eyes of the weak.

James Blunt,"I have seen peace. I have seen pain,
Resting on the shoulders of your name.
Do you see the truth through all their lies?
Do you see the world through troubled eyes?
And if you want to talk about it anymore,
Lie here on the floor and cry on my shoulder,
I'm a friend.

I have seen birth. I have seen death.
Lived to see a lover's final breath.
Do you see my guilt? Should I feel fright?
Is the fire of hesitation burning bright?
And if you want to talk about it once again,
On you I depend. I'll cry on your shoulder.
You're a friend.

You and I have been through many things.
I'll hold on to your heart.
I wouldn't cry for anything,
But don't go tearing your life apart.

I have seen fear. I have seen faith.
Seen the look of anger on your face.
And if you want to talk about what will be,
Come and sit with me, and cry on my shoulder,
I'm a friend.
And if you want to talk about it anymore,

There is nothing else in the world,
I'd rather wake up and see (with you).
Beautiful dawn, I'm just chasing time again.
Thought I would die a lonely man, in endless night.
But now I'm high; running wild among all the stars above.
Sometimes it's hard to believe you remember me.

Beautiful dawn, melt with the stars again.
Do you remember the day when my journey began?
Will you remember the end (of time)?
Beautiful dawn, You're just blowing my mind again.
Thought I was born to endless night, until you shine.
High; running wild among all the stars above.
Sometimes it's hard to believe you remember me.

Promise me tomorrow starts with you,
Getting high; running wild among all the stars above.

Arms outstretched and to the sky
Tears drying on their face

Fathers lost without a trace
A nation blind to their disgrace

No bravery
In your eyes anymore only sadness
And I see no bravery
No bravery
In your eyes anymore only sadness

The smell of death is in the air
A woman weeping in despair says
He has been here
Tracer lighting up the sky
It's another family's turn to die 
A child afraid to even cry out says
He has been here

There are children standing here
Arms outstretched and to the sky
But no one asks the question why
He has been here
Old men kneel to except their fate
Wives and daughters cut and raped
A generation drenched in hate says
he has been here

No bravery
In your eyes anymore only sadness
And I see no bravery
No bravery
In your eyes anymore

Do you seem real but I seem fake?
Does everyone get hypnotized by your fire?

Shed the clothes that become my skin;
See the liar that burns within my needing.
How I wish I'd chosen darkness from cold.
How I wish I had screamed out loud,
Instead I've found no meaning.

I guess it's time I run far, far away; find comfort in pain,
All pleasure's the same: it just keeps me from trouble.
Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray.
I've heard what they say, but I'm not here for trouble.
It's more than just words: it's just tears and rain.

How I wish I could walk through the doors of my mind;
Hold memory close at hand,
Help me understand the years.
How I wish I could choose between Heaven and Hell.
How I wish I would save my soul.
I'm so cold from fear.

Adesso in me di tutto il buono che see'è

Lo so, sei la primavera in anticipo
La prova che dimostra quale effetto hai su me perché

All my hopes and my fears, my hopes, my fears
In this moment are clear
You are the one

Per questo nei polmoni cambia l'aria
Del resto sei, sei tutto il buono che see'è

Lo so, questa primavera è in anticipo

Tender you got
I'm watching you breathing
For the last time

But when it is quiet
I know what it means
And I'll carry you home
I'll carry you home

If she had wings she would fly away
And another day god will give her some

And summers little girl has been taken from the world tonight

James Blunt,"One day your story will be told
One of the lucky ones who's made his name
One day they'll make you glorious
Beneath the lights of your deserved fame
And it all comes round
Once in a lifetime like it always does
Everybody loves you cause you've taken a chance
Out on a dance to the moon
Too soon

And they'll say told you so
We were the ones who saw you first of all
We always knew that you were one of the brightest stars

One day they'll tell you that you've changed
Though they're the ones who seem to stop and stare
One day you'll hope to make the grave
Before the papers choose to send you there

And it all comes round
Once in a lifetime like it always does
Nobody loves you cause you've taken a chance
Out on a dance to the moon
Too soon

And they'll say told you so
We were the ones who saw you first of all
We always knew that you were one of the brightest stars

James Blunt,"Saw the world turning in my sheets
And once again, I cannot sleep
Walk out the door and up the street
Look at the stars beneath my feet
Remember rights that I did wrong
So here I go

Hello, hello
There is no place I cannot go
My mind is muddy but 
My heart is heavy, does it show?
I lose the track that loses me, so here I go

Oh ooh
Oh ooh
Oh ooh

And so I sent some men to fight
And one came back at dead of night
Said he'd seen my enemy
Said he looked just like me
So I set out to cut myself 
And here I go

Oh ooh
Oh ooh
Oh ooh

I'm not calling for a second chance
I'm screaming at the top of my voice
Give me reason, but don't give me choice
'Cause I'll just make the same mistake again

Oh ooh

And maybe someday we will meet
And maybe talk, and not just speak
Don't buy the promises, 'cause
There are no promises I keep

James Blunt,"Are you calling for our last dance?
I see it in your eyes in your eyes
I could use the same old lines but I'll sing

Shine on, just shine on
Close your eyes and they'll all be gone
They can scream and shout that they've been sold out
But it paved the cloud that we're dancing on
So shine on, just shine on
With your smile just as bright as the sun
'Cause they're all just slaves to the Gods they've made
But you and I, just shone, just shone

And when silence greets my last goodbye
The words I need are in your eyes
And I'll sing 

Shine on, just shine on
Close your eyes and they'll all be gone
They can scream and shout that they've been sold out

You won't let me shine the light
I would wash away your troubles
But it seems

The more that I hold on
The more that you let go
And I know, you better let somebody love you
Or find yourself, on your own

Tell me why all the best laid plans
Fall apart in your hands
And my good intentions never end,
The way I meant

If we don't talk about the future
Then should I just, follow you into the dark
Yeah, and does your silence keep you cool
While the cracks form on my heart

Tell me why all the best laid plans
Fall apart in your hands
And my good intentions never end,
The way I meant

It seems to me some fine friends have watched you turn your back
It seems you only want the things that you can't have.

Tell me why all the best laid plans
Fall apart in your hands
And my good intentions never end,
The way I meant

Tell me why all the best laid plans
Fall apart in your hands
And my good intentions never end,
The way I meant",Best Laid Plans
James Blunt,"Well you can stand there waiting for a rainy day
Close up your heart and hide your dancing shoes away
And cut yourself with your mistakes
Leave all hope lying in a line of chalk
Everything you need is disguised in double talk
So wound yourself and let it ache

But if you're waiting for something to bring you round
I'm calling out, I'm calling out your name
Lift your head up high
I'm calling out, I'm calling out your name
Lift your head up high

It's all little pieces till there's nothing left
All just debris of your former self
Just take a breath for your own sake
And if you're watching for something to bring you round

I'm calling out, I'm calling out your name
Lift your head up high
I'm calling out, I'm calling out your name
Lift your head up high

And are you caught, between the lines
Did no one see, you fall behind

I'm calling out, I'm calling out your name

Gon' lift your head up, gon' lift your head up high

Just watching her slaughter them
See you all go wild

Testing out the water
See you on the other side

And she's all dressed up and knocking at my door, whoa
She is dangerous, she is dangerous, I know, whoa
But she's got my heart and she's never letting go

I'll be hanging on your heartache
Enough rope for my sake and losing every time
I'll be wrapped around your finger,
Let the moment linger then

James Blunt,"This time her minds made up
Yeah, she's moving on
It's not like her spirit's crushed
It's just she don't belong

Maybe she thinks too much
She thinks she's given enough
God only knows, she's got a heart of gold

Always looking for love
She's beginning to think she's cursed
On her looks she judged
By the folks at work

All alone at night she's cried
Silently is filled with pride
One day they'll know, she's got a heart of gold

And she sings, I want to know what love is
But it seems to come with so much pain
If no one wants to show me
It seems easier just to run away
When I am gone it's just a penny for my soul
But God he knows, I got a heart of gold

Been coming 'round here
Since she's a little girl
But now the change is clear
We live in a cynical world

She don't care for fashion and fame
Those kind of people they are all the same
They don't wanna know, she's got a heart of gold

And she sings, I want to know what love is
But it seems to come with so much pain
If no one wants to show me
It seems easier just to run away
When I am gone it's just a penny for my soul
But God he knows, I got a heart of gold

To see her footsteps in the snow

And she sings, I want to know what love is
But it seems to come with so much pain
If no one wants to show me
It seems easier just to run away
When I am gone it's just a penny for my soul

James Blunt,"Too many voices, too many noises
Invisible wires keeping us apart
So many choices, but they're all disappointments
And they only seal me away from you

Climb into our own private bubble
Let's get into all kinds of trouble

Slide over here let your hands feel the way
There's no better method to communicate
Girl stop your talking words just get in the way
I'll be your man
So baby come over from the end of the sofa
I'll be your man, I'll be your man

So many faces, staring at their shoelaces
When all anyone wants is to be seen
So tonight let's be honest
We only want to be wanted
And darling you got me wanting you

Everything that I'm trying to say
Just sounds like a worn out cliche

Slide over here let your hands feel the way
There's no better method to communicate
Girl stop your talking words just get in the way
I'll be your man
So baby come over from the end of the sofa
I'll be your man, I'll be your man

What are we all looking for?
Someone we just can't ignore it's
Real love dripping from my heart
You've got me tripping
What are we all looking for?

Slide over here let your hands feel the way
There's no better method to communicate
Girl stop your talking words just get in the way
I'll be your man

James Blunt,"When you wake up
Turn the radio on
And you'll hear this simple song
That I made up
That I made up for you

When you're driving
Turn the radio up
Cause I can't sing loud enough
Hard these days
To get my message through

If time is all I have
I'll waste it all on you

Each day I'll turn it back
It's what the broken-hearted do
I'm tired of talking to an empty space
Of silences keeping me awake

When you marry
And you look around
I'll be somewhere in that crowd
Torn up, that it isn't me

When you're older
And the memories fade
But I know I'll still feel the same
For as long as I live

But if time is all I have
I'll waste it all on you

Each day I'll turn it back
It's what the broken-hearted do
I'm tired of talking to an empty space
Of silences keeping me awake

Won't you say my name, one time
Please just say my name

But if time is all I have
I'll waste it all on you
Each day I'll turn it back
It's what the broken-hearted do
I'm tired of talking to an empty space
Of silences keeping me awake

If time is all I have
I'll waste it all on you

Each day I'll turn it back
It's what the broken-hearted do
I'm tired of talking to an empty space
Of silences keeping me awake

Won't you say my name

No tears for the life that you've led
You've had angels in your head
Did you hear them singing in the end
All the things that you've seen
All the things that could have been
Well I've been everything I want to be
So no tears, no tears for me

Yeah, I've bathed in sunshine 
But cherished the fading light
And I heard my heartbeat faulter 
On a winter's night
I loved a woman 
She didn't hear my prayers
So Lord, oh Lord, I'm yours

No tears for the life that you've led
You've had angels in your head

Cause he don't feel right
There are storm clouds brewing at the back of his mind
As he steps outside

He will be twenty in a week
But he's old for his years
He's had many of those
To confront his own fears

'Cause his father's not the man he'd like to grow up to be
And his mother isn't growing old gracefully

He says times like these I don't want to be a superstar
Cause reality T.V. killed them all in America
Though the sun always shines in the magazines
Tonight can we be free to be who we really are

There is an empty space between the lines tonight
And it burns so bright
And the angry silence that he throws on the floor
Says he don't care anymore

He had money for the truth
But love's a lot more
The answer's not the one he was looking for
His father's not the man he'd like to grow up to be
And his mother is his mother reluctantly
