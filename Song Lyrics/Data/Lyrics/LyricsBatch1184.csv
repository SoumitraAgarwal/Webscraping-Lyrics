Stefanie Heinzmann,"Hey, I talked to your mother the other day
She said: ""I wish he was here""
""I wish he would stay""

How can I tell her what you've really done
Cause every mother loves her son

(It reminded me) Of the way it used to be
(It reminded me) Why I had to set you free
(It reminded me) That you got a kid on the way
(It reminded me) Why I just couldn't stay 

(Can't trust nobody) Just by the words they speak
(Don't understand) Why you move that way on me

I can't get you out of my system baby
You're still everywhere, can't get you out of my hair, I swear
I always see you where I go baby
You're bringing me down
I can't get away from you 

Tell me how do you sleep with your double life
A man is supposed to have just one wife
Did you think I wouldn't hear it on the vine
I wish that I could press rewind

(It reminded me) Oooh, of that bitch you flaunt
(It reminded me) Of my favourite restaurant
I can't believe you brought her here
In the same black dress I used to wear

(I can't erase you) From my memory
(I can't replace) All the joy you stole from me

I can't get you out of my system baby
You're still everywhere, can't get you out of my hair, I swear
I always see you where I go baby
You're bringing me down, and I can't get away from you

I can't get you out of my system baby
You're still everywhere, can't get you out of my hair, I swear
I always see you where I go baby
You're bringing me down, and I can't get away from you

I can't get you out of my system baby
You're still everywhere, can't get you out of my hair, I swear
I always see you where I go baby
You're bringing me down, and I can't get away from you

Nothing to say
Lately I wonder
Who you are today
I know all about you
But I don't understand
Why you won't see me
Why things have changed

Oh baby something is going on
God knows I know

Cus you can't keep nothing from me
Cus I know what I've seen now
You can try your best to deceive
But I know where you've been now
Oooh, our time has come
Don't call this love

I might be no good
In your eyes only
One day you'll see that
I was good for you honey
You need to grow up
Get your life together
We can't go on now
Doing this to each other

Stefanie Heinzmann,"Let your hair down, get yourself over here
Everybody's waiting now
Set your mind free let your heart go just feel
Tell me do you hear me now

You can spread your wings and fly so high
Ride on the waves, whatever feels right

Don't you know that we're the children of
A time of free love
Gotta have it, gotta give it, gotta let it go
Yeah we're the children of
A time of free love
It's inside us, all around us, everywhere we go
Oooh, yeah, yeah

(Free love)
(Free love)

Take your shoes of, put your thoughts on a shelf
Everybody's chillin' out
You can free fall, let your body ease itself
Doesn't really matter how

You can put some music on, as loud as you like
Turn down the light, whatever feels right

Don't you know that we're the children of
A time of free love
Gotta have it, gotta give it, gotta let it go

Stefanie Heinzmann,"His moments of bliss, dew under foot,
Fingers dipped in melted wax.
Her moments of joy, walking on snow,
Face caress on a warm pane.

Gifts of immeasurable worth,
Moments so unnoticed they slip through your hand.
Gifts of immeasurable worth,
Precious and small and great in the things they bring.

His moments of bliss, bursting some bubbles,
Eating sweet dough from a bowl.
Her moments of joy, jumping in puddles,
Breathing in rain on its way.

Gifts of immeasurable worth,
Moments so unnoticed they slip through your hand.
Gifts of immeasurable worth,
Precious and small and great in the things they bring.

Small leaves, big impressions
In a short yet timeless time. (2x)

Gifts of immeasurable worth,
These are moments so unnoticed.
Gifts of immeasurable worth,
Gifts so precious and great.

These are those moments of bliss,
Holding your hand,
Telling you all of the things he feels.",Xtal [*]

Stefanie Powers,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this: a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young
Stefanie Powers,"Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I intend to be independently blue
I want your love but I don't want to borrow
I have it today and give back tomorrow
For my love is your love but there's no love for nobody else",Love Me or Leave Me

Stefano Battaglia,"All is fair in love 
Love's a crazy game 
Two people vow to stay 
In love as one they say 

But all is changed with time 
The future no one can see 
The road you leave behind 
Ahead lies mystery 

But all is fair in love 
I had to go away 
A writer takes his pen 
To write the words again 
That all in love is fair 

All of fate's a chance 
It's either good or bad 
I tossed my coin to say 
In love with me you'd stay 

But all in war is so cold 
You either win or lose 
When all is put away 
The losing side I'll play 

But all is fair in love 
I should never have left your side

Stefano Battaglia,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

Stefano Benini,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

Stefano Bollani,"Sometimes the world is a valley of heartaches and tears
And in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears
But you and I have our love always there to remind us
There is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us
Volare, oh, oh! Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather a rainbow together we'll find
Volare, oh, oh! Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
No wonder my happy heart sings
Your love has given me wings

Stefano Bollani,"I once had a girl 
Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone 
This bird had flown 
So I lit a fire 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?",Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)
Stefano Bollani,"How did I know that the warmth of the glow would last.
How did I guess that the long loneliness was past.
I merely looked at you and I knew that I knew.

It's you or no one for me
I'm sure of this each time we kiss
Now and forever and when forever's done
You'll find that you are still the one

Please don't say no to my plea

But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this

When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

Is your new name

She said as the sun
As ever the moon
You put it together
I am twilight
As ever I'm black
As ever I'm white
You put me together 
I am twilight

She lit up
From the whole ride
Through the photographs
She lit up

She's the face of the day
She's known for being that way
Every man wants a part
Its what all women want
Sugar girl
Your a diva
The press would really like to know
Do you adore yourself
Like all the rest of us do

She said as the sun
As ever the moon
You put it together
I am twilight
As ever I'm black
As ever I'm white
You put me together 
I am twilight

As ever I'm dark
As ever I""m white 
You put me together
I am twilight
I am twilight
I am twilight

Where a moment lasts forever
And our love shines brighter than the stars
Until then I will remember
Every word and every letter
The promises you've written on my heart
On my heart

I see the darkness blinding
And all that's left are my dreams
To save me from the night
Your words of hope remind me
Somewhere the sun is shining
Don't give up the fight

There's love in every letter written
A hope that gets me through the day
Forever is never too long to wait

Sit back and watch the scenery change
Hold on to the promise that help is on the way

God is not
A stranger to the things you might say

And all the times you said you were there for me.
Stood up to back my life.. Got up again to fight
Blinded by the lies, left for all to see.
Stripped down, start to fight. I can't erase these lines.
I denied, I denied and I defied the last thing you said to me.

",Holding On
Stemm,"Just make this go away.
There's nothing left inside for you to take.

I can't believe I'm all by myself
Ripping away all that remains,
Pieces of me, they just fall away.

As I fall, further away from myself
I seek the days that escape me.
I choke on the ones I'm left with
The monster's building inside me.

And I hate the way I feel.
I pray THE wounds will heal.
Before the darkness,
How long will this last?

I try - with every waking moment of my life
As I waste away
To hide - the monster that is building up inside
The scars in me
So blind - pins and needles buried in my eyes
What's left of me
Goodbye - to everything that's chasing me

Look into my eyes, do you see yourself?
The reflection I see everyday.
I'd bury my hate, but the pain is killing me.

As I look in the mirror to see my face clearer,
Reflections of shame staring back at me.
I choke on my wretchedness,
The monster builds up inside me.

And I hate the way I feel.
I pray THE wounds will heal.
Before the darkness,
How long will this last?

I try - with every waking moment of my life
As I waste away
To hide - the monster that is building up inside
The scars in me
So blind - pins and needles buried in my eyes
What's left of me
Goodbye - to everything that's chasing me

So blind - now I know how you make me feel.
So tired - everything I know is crushing me,
And I know that you can not trust in me.
Now I know how you make me feel.

Why can't I stop this madness

Has left a pool of tears

And many times I've cried
Anyway you'll never know

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore

And I seem to find the happiness I seek

Heaven, I'm in Heaven
And the cares that hang around me thro' the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing, cheek to cheek

Oh! I love to climb a mountain
And to reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Oh! I love to go out fishing 
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Dance with me
I want my arm about you
The charm about you
Will carry me thro' to Heaven

Just one of those fabulous flights
A trip to the moon
On gossamer wings

We'd have been aware that our love affair

Still we're often told, ""seek and ye shall find""
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet
He's the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret

Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longin' to see
I hope that he, turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could, always be good
To one who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key

Follow my lead, oh, how I need

Soon be-kinda-comes my only goal

But I won't be happy

Stéphane Grappelli,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",She's Funny That Way

Tell me to save my tears
Well I'm so mad about him
I can't live without him

And that ain't good

My poor heart is so sentimental
Not made of wood
I've got it so bad
And that ain't good

But when the fish are jumpin'
And Friday rolls around
My man an' I, we gin some
We pray some, and sin some

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go

I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

I am so awfully misunderstood

Stéphane Grappelli,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust [Take 1][#]

I took even one sniff,
It would bore me terrifically,too,

Standing there before me,
I get a kick though it's clear to see,

I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April
Stéphane Grappelli,"Just you, just me
Let's find a cozy spot
To cuddle and coo

Stéphane Grappelli,"Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again.
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Taking a Chance on Love
Stéphane Grappelli,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon
Stéphane Grappelli,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot

I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

Stéphane Grappelli,"Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss-covered vines, tall sugar pines
Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

When that's where you left your heart
And there's one thing more, I miss the one I care for
More than I miss New Orleans",Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

I left my heart in San Francisco.
High on a hill it calls to me
to be where little cable cars 
climb halfway to the stars!

above the blue and windy sea.

Stéphane Grappelli,"The day is my enemy, the night my friend,
For I'm always so alone till the day draws to an end,
But when the sun goes down and the moon comes through,
To the monotone of the evening's drone I'm all alone with you.

All through the night,
I delight in your love,
All through the night you're so close to me!
All through the night,
From a height far above,
You and your love brings me ecstasy!

And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love

Stéphane Grappelli,"Oh! they say some people long ago
Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues
Stéphane Grappelli,"I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of dawn and forests of the night

Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

In the world of love that you keep in your eyes

Stéphane Grappelli,"Since first you blew in like a boisterous breeze
I often have wondered, Dear
Why gentlemen all seem to fall on their knees
The moment that you appear
Your fetching physique is hardly unique
You're mentally not so hot
You'll never win laurels because of your morals
But I'll tell you what you've got

You've got that thing, you've got that thing
That thing that makes birds forget to sing
Yes, you've got that thing, that certain thing

You've got that charm, that subtle charm
That makes young farmers desert the farm
'Cause you've got that thing, that certain thing

You've got what Adam craved when he
With love for Eve was tortured
She only had an apple tree
But you, you've got an orchard

You've got those ways, those taking ways
That make me rush off to Cartier's
For a wedding ring, you've got that thing

You've got that thing, you've got that thing
That thing that makes vines prefer to cling
Yes, you've got that thing, that certain thing

You've got those looks, those fatal looks
That make book censors enjoy their books
'Cause you've got that thing, that certain thing

Just what made Samson be, for years
Delilah's lord and keeper
She only had a pair of shears
But you, you've got a reaper

You've got that power, that power to grip
That makes me map out a wedding trip
For the early spring, you've got that thing

You've got that thing, you've got that thing
That thing that makes bees refuse to sting
Yes, you've got that thing, that certain thing

You've got that kiss, that kiss that warms
That makes reformers reform reforms
'Cause you've got that thing, that certain thing

They tell us Trojan Helen's lips
Made every man her slavey
If her face launched a thousand ships
Well, yours could launch a navy

You've got that that love, and such a lot
It makes me think you're prepared for what
Any stork might bring, you've got that thing",You've Got a Thing

A thing or two, a wing or two. 
We will make changes as any family will. 
But we will always be called

The sort of view that seems to want to be seen.

We'll sit and look at the same old view, just we two.

All the precious memories
Little things she'd like to hide
A magic wand, an old rag doll
Some plastic pearls 'cause after all

A little girl is only a little girl so long
And tender hearts need their stars to wish upon
'Cause one day you will turn around and she'll be gone
A little girl is only a little girl so long

One day when she got home from school
She slipped a little note
Beneath the tattered lining
And here is what he wrote
""Roses are red, violets are blue""
""Put an X in the box if you like me too""

A little girl is only a little girl so long
And tender hearts need their stars to wish upon
'Cause one day you will turn around and she'll be gone

In a horse and carriage they waved and rode away

And spotted a letter lying on the old hopechest

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day

And mail it right away

Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be

She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent

She'd be so much better off if I went away.

She'd be unhappy without me I know

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best

Stephanie Davis,"A poor orphan girl named Maria
Was walking to market one day
She stopped for a rest by the roadside
Where a bird with a broken wing lay
A few moments passed till she saw it
For it's feathers were covered with sand
But soon clean and wrapped it was traveling
In the warmth of Maria's small hand

She happily gave her last peso
On a cage made of rushes and twine
She fed it loose corn from the market
And watched it grow stronger with time

Now the Christmas Eve service was coming
And the church shone with tinsel and light
And all of the townfolk brought presents
To lay by the manger that night
There were diamonds and incense and perfumes
In packages fit for a king
But for one ragged bird in a small cage
Maria had nothing to bring

She waited till just before midnight
So no one could see her go in
And crying she knelt by the manger
For her gift was unworthy of Him

Then a voice spoke to her through the darkness
Maria, what brings you to me
If the bird in the cage is your offering
Open the door, let me see
Though she trembled, she did as he asked her
And out of the cage the bird flew
Soaring into the rafters
On a wing that had healed good as new

Just then the midnight bells rang out
And the little bird started to sing
A song that no words could recapture
Whose beauty was fit for a king

Now Maria felt blessed just to listen
To that cascade of notes sweet and long
As her offering was lifted to heaven
By the very first nightingale's song",The Gift

Again only in our minds
Filling up the time we lost
Before we said goodbye

Growing in silence and watered by tears

Of what she has become
What was new, was torn in two
But time will bring the sun

I’ve got ear ache from the winter wind
From high up on the most Northern point

All the random pieces in my life are falling into place
In an instant, I am flying high and scared to death
'Cause I wonder if you feel it too, I wanna be a part of you

If it's goodbye now, forever, and I never get to see you again
If it's the last kiss before the world should end, I want to thank you for the night of my life

Will this feeling, touch you and linger on your skin?
Or like a feather in the wind, blow away out into space
Will my memories haunt you and bring you back again?
And I wonder if you need me too, the way that I've been needing you

If it's goodbye now, forever, and I never get to see you again
If it's the last kiss before the world should end, I want to thank you for the night of my life

Oh, don't go away
Stay with me and the sun will rise

Why don't you steal this smile, but swear you won't leave me alone
Or I would sink like a stone

Silently you slip in, and totally change everything
Suddenly I hear breathing, and now I am sinking like a stone

With every word, you spell our destiny
My world just spins, into a crazy dream
With every hour, we talk until it is light, it's a perfect, perfect night

That I'm falling
There's no safety net.

Arms wide open,
Then you smile and walk away.

All the things I took for granted flipped and changed.
Now I'm losing grip again

Oh oh, I'm walking a tightrope
Between who I love and what I love
Oh oh, I'm watching the sharks
With their lips as they circle far below.

I'd slip my skin and lose this face if
We could find a secret place to hide
Say the words I need to hear, and
I would leave it all behind

My psychic says she sees disaster
My heart is begging that 
I take a giant leap of faith
See are you really worth the risk
Of losing everything I have
For what might be one stupid kiss

I don't know why it is
That you won't say you love me
I don't know what it is

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,

Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby 
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby 

They call me Uncle L, Future of the Funk
Records I recorded minus all the junk
People spread gossip and believe what they must
While I slam dunk fags and make em bite the dust
A minute is needed to make a phony roni bleed
And put him in a bucket like it's chicken feed
Check out the, pick of the litter, not a quitter, I'm nice y'all
And I'ma dust you off and dust you off twice
You never heard this so observant all hysterical 
Fan-natics of the Asiatic miracle man
Prominent, dominant, McCoy and I'm Real
If you're another brother's fan?  
Forget how you feel
Cause he's so-so, I got the instinct
They call me Deputy Dog, now put your ass in the clink
Innovating, devastating, and dope on the single now
Let me see your earrings jingle

[Chorus]

I chopped you, chewed you, baked you and fucked you
That shit you pop, you need to stop, you're kind of rude you
No good nigga-boo trying to base
How we living Holmes?  
Get out my face!
I'm complete, in effect, and I can't fall
I rise, surprise, and I advise you all
To stand back and peep, don't sleep or doubt
My skill'll get I'll, I turn the mother out
I'm top-notch, you're still playing hop-scotch
Now I'ma do ya while the party people watch
You're real funny, you really try to go for yours
But I know why: you ain't had no dough before
So you tried and lied to drain my fame
This ain't a game, yo, you know my name
Forget all the MC's who like to mingle
Yo baby, let me see your earrings jingle

[Chorus]

When you first walked in, I ain't know what to think
You grabbed the microphone like your {shit} don't stink
And tried to run down that, I can't get over that
Bullshit you were sayin', you call that a battle rap?
How you gonna go against an army with a handgun?
I'm Cool J, yo you don't understand, son
I'm a legend, on top of that I'm livin'
Now you look stupid like that {bitch} Ms. Givens
Whoever geesed you up, nah, how should I say it?
Whoever set you up, they knew just how to play it
Cause man, YO, I feel for you brother
I'm a bad (Word to my mother!)
Taking out suckers while the ladies pucker
And rolling over niggas like a redneck trucker
Innovating, devastating, and dope on a single, now
Lemme see your earrings jingle

[Chorus]

Yeah baby, you know what I mean?
You like be jingling crazy, word
(yeah yeah yeah)
All over this funky beat
You be like jingling, and your earrings be jingling
And shaking all over the place and all
It's like real, it's real wild to me honey ya know what I mean?
The way you be jingling, word

[Chorus]

Can't believe you tried to grip the same mic as me
Your grip's too weak, you can't hold it, B
You can dream of making progress and getting this nice
But when I roll up, it's like Hip Hop Vice
I serve to curbs, I never swerve I'm superb
Every word you heard played tricks on your nerves
You played your hand, lost track of your plan
When I show up, I blow up, end of story, my man
I'm a play you like a poker chip, that's what you get
I bet your fret, sweat, and regret you met
The titan of fighting, exciting when writing, you trifling toy-boy
I gotta enlighten, so start biting
You know you can't create and get mean like this
When I'm on the court, G, it's strictly swish!
When it's all over, said and done, my friend
They say, ""That {bad motherfucker} just scored again""
So take a step back, give me some room to wreck shop
Here's your token back, you're getting off at the next stop
I'ma deliver and give a speech with vigor
I drink some Olde E and start waxing (niggas)

But that isn't still to say
It knows how to teach us well
It helps us find our way.

As much as we sacrifice
Is only as much as we can gain
Forgiving not once but twice
And then again and again

It isn't about how much we can get
It isn't remembering what love would forget,
I've found the secret of learning to live
It's all in how much we give.

Sometimes the rain pours down
Flooding across the land,
Sometimes the sun shines bright
Warming our hearts again
I'll be here by your said
Through every season's change.

It isn't about how much we can get
It isn't remembering what love would forget
I've found the secret of learning to live

Or the unsuspecting nights,
When the road is hard to find
Love will be our light!

Stephanie Mills,"When I think of home
I think of a resting place
A place where there's peace, quiet, and serenity
And that's where some of my friends have gone
Friends who have traveled with me through my wonderful experience in Oz
A journey I'll never forget

When I think of home, I think of a place
where's there's love overflowing
I wish I was home, I wish I was back there
With the things I've been knowing

Wind that makes the tall grass bend into leaning
Suddenly the raindrops that fall they have a meaning
Sprinklin' the scene
Makes it all clean

(When I think of home)
Maybe there's a chance for me to go back
Now that I have some direction
(Maybe there's a chance I'll get home)
It sure would be nice to be back at home
Where there's love and affection

And just maybe I can convince time to slow up
Givin' me enough time, ooh, in my life to grow up
Time be my friend
And let me start again

Suddenly my world's gone and change it's fate
And I still know where I'm going
I have had my mind spun round in space
And watched it growing

And oh, if you're listening, God, please don't make it hard
To know if we should believe the things that we see
Tell us should we try and stay or should we run away (should we run away)
Or will it be better just to let things, let them be, oh

Livin' here in this brand new world

And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine
It happened in Monterey
Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart, longs for the sweetheart 
That I left in old Monterey
 
Making believe I'm merry
In ev'ry glass of sherry
I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is
Stephanie Nakasian,"Beautiful miracle, pardon my lyrical rhapsody,
But can't you see, you've captured me.
Being so glamorous, can't you be amorous just with me?
Make it soon, take a look at the moon.

Love is just around the corner, any cozy little corner.
Love is just around the corner when I'm around you.
I'm a sentimental mourner, and I couldn't be forlorner,
When you keep me in a corner just waiting for you.
Venus de Milo was noted for her charms,
But strictly between us, you're cuter than Venus,
And what's more you got arms.
So cuddle in a corner, any cozy corner,
Love is just around the corner and I'm around you.",Love Is Just Around the Corner
Stephanie Nakasian,"Dream beside me in the midnight glow, the lamp Is low
Dream and watch the shadows came and go, the lamp Is low
While you linger in my arms, my lips will sigh ""I love you so"" 
Dream the sweetest dream will ever know
Tonight the moon is high, the lamp Is low
 
Dream beside me in the midnight glow, the lamp Is low
Dream and watch the shadows came and go, the lamp Is low

Stephanie Nakasian,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You
Stephanie Nakasian,"I'm a very ordinary man
Trying to work out life's happy plan
Doing unto others as I'd like to have them doing unto me

When I find a very lonely soul
Soon be-kinda-comes my only goal
I feel so much better when I tell them my philosophy

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Life's really worth living
When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you

When skies are gray and you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

From the horizon to infinity
Static forces down the line
Connecting voices talking rhymes

Can't decode nor can define
The signal's perfect indicates a sign

Guiding light
Take the eye
Go skimming
Across the sky

Connecting voices in the air
New formations moving sound
Then came what I could not explain
I felt a hand turned Oround and saw a face",Midnight Sun

You taught me how to care
Am I to be just the remnant of a one-sided love affair?
All you took, I gladly gave
There's nothing left for me to save

All of me why not take all of me
Can't you see I'm no good without you
Take my lips I want to lose them
Take my arms I'll never use them
Your good bye left me with eyes that cry
How can I go on dear without you

You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me",All of Me

And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
 
Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new

Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure

Stephanie Phillips,"When I think of home, I think of a place
Where there's love overflowing
I wish I were home, I wish I was back there
With the things I've been knowin'
Wind that makes the tall trees bend into leaning
Suddenly the snowflakes that fall have a meaning
Sprinkling the sea
Makes it all clean

Maybe there's a way for me to go back
Now that I have some direction
It would sure be nice to back home
Where there's love and affection
And just maybe I can convince time to slow up
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up
Time be my friend
Let me start again

Suddenly my world's gone and changed it's face
But I still know where I'm goin'
I have had my mind spun around in space
And yet I've watched it growin'
If you're listening God, please don't make it hard to know
If we should believe the things that we see
Tell us should we run away, should we try and stay?
Or is better just to let things be?

Living here in this brand new world might be a fantasy
But it's taught me to love so it's real to me
And I've learned that we must look inside our hearts to find
A world full of love like yours and mine
Like home",Home

Stephanie Smith,"It was the freshman year of my high school career
Things had barely gotten underway
Before my innocence would be betrayed
Starting with a phone call, a family member dies
And at the funeral I looked into your eyes
For the first time, this was a dream of mine
But you didn't know me, you didn't know my name

The first words you spoke to me
Since you left my family
You didn't call me Stephanie
This will take some getting over don't you agree

But now I'm here
I know it's been a few years
I've shed a few tears and now I have a few things to say
When we met, you broke my heart
14 years old and you tore me apart
But that aside, please know I love you
And more than that, I forgive you

Meeting at a truck stop for lunch
We covered basics, let's keep in touch
Not even a week later, a letter in the mail
You think it's better to let this fail
Another attempt to get to know my father
Efforts exhausted, why did I bother

The first words you wrote to me
Since I made you family
They worried me to the worse degree
This will take some getting over don't you agree

But now I'm here
And now it's been a few years
I've shed a few tears and now I have a few things to say
When we met, you broke my heart
19 years old and you tore me apart
But that aside, please know I love you
And more than that, I forgive you

What you'll see is
Perseverance grown weak
Oh I'll try to deny
But if you look closely
You'll see through the lies
In my eyes
What you'll see has
Been damaged on delivery
I'll try to deny
But I just need you to hear my cry
You think you're helping
But you're just pouring
Salt on my wounds

My heart is screaming
But you won't hear a word from my mouth
Here bleeding
Condemning myself into this hell
Losing feeling

Is in my eyes

If you're looking in my eyes
What you'll see is
A girl with a plea
Oh I try to disguise
I'm getting closer and closer
To throwing in the towel
In my eyes
I'm entangled by insecurities
Oh why do I hide
When you're the only one
Which I can rely
So won't you help me
Oh please help me
Find my way through
Find my way through

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, oh

If I can see it, then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I felt a true love
She was everything
I'd ever been dreaming of

But she was bad, I didn't know it
Her pretty smile never did show it
All I knew is what I could see
And I knew I wanted her for me

Took her home to mama
Mama, wanna see my future bride
Well she looked at us both
Then she called me to her side

She said son, take time to know her
It's not an overnight thing
Take time to know her
Please don't go rushin to do your thing

But I didn't listen to my mama
I went straight to the church
I just couldn't wait for that little girl of mine
When I got off from work
The preacher was there
So was my future bride
He looked at us both and he called me to his side

Take time to know her
Not an overnight fling
Take time to know her
Don't go rushin to do your thing

But it looks like every thing's gonna turn out all right
But then I came home from work a little early one night
And there she was kissin on another man
Now I know what mama meant when she took me by the hand

She said, take time to know her
Not an overnight fling
Take time to know her
Don't go rushin to do your thing
She said, take time to know her
Not an overnight fling

Don't go rushin to do your thing

I've never before heard so much pain in a voice.

And everyone says things that they regret sometimes,
But I swear you're serious this time.

Don't break up our line.

I think it's just different this time.
I mean, it's happened before, but not like this time.

And I know there'll be fires from time to time,
And everyone says things that they regret sometimes.

Stephen Bennett,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

No need for greed or hunger

Who cut me deep
Like footprints in the sand
Leading away from me

But I got me an island, a hideaway to hide in
When there's nowhere else to go

I let the trees sway, let the winds blow
I'm alone in my hut with my radio
No one to hurt me or call me names
And no one but me to blame

They took all I gave them
Threw my heart into the bay
So now I just lay in the palm tree
And throw my worries away

But I got me an island, a hideaway to hide in
'Til the sun breaks through these clouds

I let the trees sway, let the winds blow
I'm alone in my hut with my radio
No one to hurt me or call me names
And no one but me to blame

Some sunny day, something looking fine
Is going to wake me up, take me off this island
But she'll have to treat me right
Or it's back to my hideaway some night

Where the trees sway, where the winds blow
I'm alone in my hut with my radio
No one to hurt me or call me names
And no one to blame

I let the trees sway, let the winds blow
I'm alone in my hut with my radio
No one to hurt me or call me names

Stephen Bishop,"I've been so unlucky
I'm no good at playing games
I remember their faces
Forget their names

Thought I found the right one
But she hasn't found me
So I bundle up my emotions and start

Looking for the right one
But will the right one ever come along
I'm looking for the right one
When will the right one come along

They say there's no use running
After something
You'll never get

But my heart says don't say no
Somewhere in this lonely city
Is the woman for me
But will I wait another lifetime to keep on

They say love always comes and goes
Well, that I already know
Yes I really know

CHORUS",Looking for the Right One
Stephen Bishop,"Everybody grab the highest star
Makes no difference who or what you are
Nary song he hears another lullaby

The dog is barking and the sheets are cold
Even the guy out on the street he knows
Love can make or break the harder (please supply)

There's no way I'm gonna make it, 
No way I'm gonna win
I can almost hear the sad goodbyes
Now what should I do, I'm losing myself in you

There's a palace (please supply)
Where only the lonely people learn to dance
Leave them laughing if you've got half a chance

Memories make you what you never are
Find your heaven in the corner bar
Then music makes you dream
You're not so far from home

Now no else could ever do
What you do, when you do it
Love, there's nothing to it.",Losing Myself in You
Stephen Bishop,"It was 1927
Had the world at my feet
A pretty girl on each arm
My family was so proud of me

I built a lot of buildings
Tore half of 'em down
One by one
They all crumbled just like me
But like a storm in a teacup
Like a smile sent down from heaven
Madge, I loved you then
and I love you now

We ate in the finest restaurants
Had the wealthiest friends
Most of them are gone now
No one left to say, ""I knew you when""

It seems so long since I've remembered
the girl I used to know
She never saw any of my money
But she watched it come and go

Like a storm in a teacup
like a smile sent down from heaven
Madge I loved you then
and I love you now

They call this place ""Sunnyside""
But I ain't seen the sun
in a long, long time
And my hands don't seem too steady now
But they're still holding onto you

Madge, she's probably married now
in a nice white house

and me I just sit here in my room
Quiet as a mouse

But I got my TV turned up loud
I'm not going to hear myself retreat
If only I'd have kept her
I'd have stayed on my feet

Stephen Bishop,"The years they come and go
And change will come I know
You won't be there, my heart and soul

With every time and place

The smile that lines your face
As you gaze in mine, you will always shine

And you would always be
An angel making sure I care
The memory, that's always there

You know you'll always be

That if I just close my eyes
I can see you there, and the love we share

And you will always be

A trusting faith that lets me fly
A love so strong that just belong to me

Saw his woman kiss another man

Puts on sinatra and starts to cry

You touched my cheek said, ""You'll do""
I was shaking in my shoes

'Cause, I never thought this strange attraction
Would give me such a strong reaction
I look in your eyes and I get paralyzed

I go numb, I can't speak
Every time I look at you, my knees go weak
I wanna die inside, every time I look at you

In a world of white noise, you gotta stay cool
Can't lose your control and all the games I played
When I was a fool, now it's you I wanna hold

'Cause, I've waited for some inspiration
A woman of sophistication
But when I'm close to you I can't seem to move

I go numb, I can't speak
Every time I look at you, my knees go weak
I wanna die inside, every time I look at you

I asked the Moon above
Said, ""Tell me if what I feel is real?
Or just an accident of love

'Cause, now I'm living in her world
And I really think, I'm falling for this girl

I rub my eyes as I wake from sleep
And leave behind
The world of my dreams
And through' my window I can see the sky
But I never see the sun

Someday
Someday
I shall fly
I want to close my eyes
In the Italian Rain
In the Italian Rain

The world outside is so far away
From this little bridge
Nothing is real
But the tears on faces
Where love has gone away

Somewhere Somewhere

I shall fly
I long to close my eyes
In the Italian Rain
In the Italian Rain

Tell me
Have they captured the moon?...

Stephen Bishop,"Well the Sun pokes through' Blonde Street
And shines on the cracks
On the walls and the heartaches
And they never shine back

Patsy clutches her rosary
And from her window she sees
Lots of social interaction
From the people down on Blonde Street

through' the peephole she sees the Landlord
Who's come for more than her rent
He says, ""I'm kicking you out pronto.
Unless your body gives me consent""

But Patsy won't give into just any guy
Crushed like a grape
From where she must hide...you see
Life is not her cup of tea...yeah
But she says,

""I WANNA LIVE ON BLONDE STREET
I WANNA LIVE ON BLONDE STREET""

There's a baby in the next room
Watchin' some guy die on T.V.
There are lovers in the basement
Havin' some kind of touchin' spree

Down the hall there's young Jimbo
Who's got his heart in hell
'Cause the girlfriend he got pregnant
Is going on Sally Jesse Raphael

Patsy laughs at her girlfriends
They're tryin' to marry someone rich
They all hang around the sofa and say
""Hey, ain't love a bitch?""

And Mars is a Planet
Where she'll find her man
She'll sail through' the black hole
'til it's his arms she's in

With eyes like Walnuts and Cinnamon skin
She won't be living the life of a Nun
And that's what she gets...

(CHORUS)

Her memories don't mean nothing
So she throws them away
Like that night in his bedroom
When he looked just like
A Young Hemingway
And she was the, ""Catch of the Day""...

Now she's walkin' down Blonde Street
Where there's so many places to hide
She's got a River of denial
Of what's locked up inside...

But she just wants to Fly...
And she says...

""I WANNA LIVE ON BLONDE STREET
I WANNA LIVE ON BLONDE STREET""

Lives a girl dear to me
She is ever so fair
Wears a rose in her hair
Like the Rose of Trailee

When I sail so far away
To a far distant bay
Always dreaming of her
Each dream seems to say

Dreaming of you
And Silver Sails out on the blue
The sails that soon will take me
Across the sea to you

Heavenly you
Beneath the skies of Azure Hue
Oh sails, please come and take me
Across the Sea to You

Each night I sit and dream
Beautiful dreams of you
And as I sit and scheme
Each dream comes true

Dreaming of you
And all the things
That will come true
For I shall soon be sailing
Across the Sea to You

Here in the darkness
I can see
Someone like me
Is calling out
Wondering how my hopes and plans
Slipped through my hands

But it's alright
It's okay
I'll never understand it
It just turned out that way
It's Alright
It's okay

Dreams of Someday

Shouting my name
Out from the crowd
Cheering loud
I hear them now

Guess it wasn't meant for me

Stephen Bishop,"I watch her through revolving doors
Through the windows of trains
On the stairway to the second floor
On crowded street covered with rain
She rushes by and I call out her name

Somehow she disappears...

So I wait for her by the cafe light
Where strangers meet
At the end of the night
And I wait for her to come to me
The Girl in the Orange Sweater

She accidentally took my seat
Pulled off her white gloves
I was captured by the look on her face
A masterpiece of beauty and grace

Just travelers passing the time...

So I wait for her by the Cafe light
Where she missed her train and
We talked all night..
And I wait for her to come back to me
The Girl in the Orange Sweater
The Girl in the Orange Sweater

And when I close my eyes I see
A cold and lonely world
If she's not there with me...

And I wait for her to come back to me

Stephen Bishop,"She was late
To the party
Couldn't find a thing to wear
She looks just like Sharon Stone
Posing for Playboy
As she reads Voltaire

One more pretty girl
Crying the tears of a child
Now her boyfriend's
Trying to con some mafia guys
On Deuces wild
'till they say, ""HEY YOU!""

So he jumps out the window
Throws all the money in the
Back of his Jag
Then they chase him through town
They're gonna make him their new punching bag

But they lose him in jersey
Now he's with his girl back home
He says, ""I had a little trouble..pack your things
We're going to Rome
I been up all night
But I'll sleep on the plane""

It's gonna be a brand new life for us, my love
You'll wear your white Fake Fur
In the Vatican Hall...

I gotta get my beauty rest
So I'll Sleep on the Plane
Yeah I'll sleep on the plane....
Guess I'll sleep on the plane...



",I'll Sleep on the Plane
Stephen Bishop,"I parked my Buick
Discovered my ticket was lost
And I had to fly ""Standby""
At twice the cost

and then the buzzer went off
At the Security check
And the hands on my body
Left me with no
Self-respect

And now my Suitcase don't fit
In the overhead
And the ugly blue Stewardess
Wishes that I
Would drop dead

So I climb into my seat
Next to the screaming baby
Next to the big, big fat man
Who's trying to steal my tan
Oh I know I won't sleep
And I'll get..

Jet Lag
Jet Lag
Yeah yeah

Now we're flyin' through the air
On this twenty hour flight
And my eyes can't seem to focus
And my head feels so light

And then the food tray comes around
And I eat like a pig
And the lady in blue says
""Baby, you better slow down
You're eyes are too big""

And if you think too much
Your brain'll start to drag
And you make it home to party
But your tail can't wag
Oh no, and guess what
You got.. (CHORUS)

I'd stop this plane
If I could
The hands on my watch
Say you don't look so good
The movie ain't so hot
You know this lousy feeling
Is all I got..

The plane lands with a thud
And I run to my car
And I tell my legs run faster
And they say who do you think you are?

So I call up my date
A September playmate
I gotta get myself together
No, I can't be late
She's so fine

And now she's kissing my ear
Says her clothes feel too tight
But as she moves a little closer
I fall asleep at the light
And she says, ""Oh baby, wake up,
You got Jet Lag!""

And I would give to you

But I must hide this love inside
Of me

for the pleasure of your company

There is a light that shines in you
It showed me how to feel again
We opened a door
We can't walk through
Still our love will never end
And it can never be..

And they are looking for
Their little piece of cake

Who doesn't want to shut his mouth
But he better get his butt
Out of the way...

They push and pull and stick you
Then they knock you down and lick you
When you turn your back
They catch you by the tail...

It's the law in every jungle

Where love has strayed
And in the colors of her darkness
She turns away

from the kind of hurt
That tears your heart to pieces
'Till you say goodbye

Well I don't see her anymore
It's for the best, I guess
And I don't see her anymore
So I kill time
Thinking that she's not mine

The moon has stolen all the memories
From my brain
So I watch the people on my TV
To hide my pain

and sometimes I can't
Imagine life without her..
And sometimes I can

But I don't see her anymore
Time will tell
When I can wish her well
I don't see her anymore
But I get by
Knowing that she's not mine

Like a mountain that stands so high
Her tears mean nothing to me
'Cause I'm too blue to cry

and somedays all I do
Is think about her

yeah, but I don't see her anymore
It's for the best, I guess
And I don't see her anymore
And Life goes by
Knowing that she's not mine...

I ask, ""Is there another man?""
And all you say is..

There There

It's been two weeks now
In my little hell
Still you won't say
Where you are

I sent a telegram
To your Parental retreat
There is no refuge too far

I think I've really lost my mind
Do you love me?
I bought a ticket to your arms
And all you can say is there there..

From my love career

As we lay down on green grass..

And now I know I wanted you in my life all along

I guess, I must have saved an empty place in my heart
For you to come and fill this space in my heart
That long before I said I loved you
I love you

Whatever happens this is true in my life
When all the springs have come and gone
Whatever dance I made or do in my life
Whatever else that I may do in my life
You'll always be something new in my life
From now on

I know there always will be you in my life
From now on

Stephen Bruton,"Working in a graveyard on a skeleton crew
Everyday above ground, is just too good to be true
Living in uncertainty is such a reality
It take nothing for granted, you got no secrets to keep
You just watch for hidden motives, reading right between the lines
The horizon keeps expanding by a thin blue line

And every single picture is more than meets the eye
They will just defend the truth if you even ask why
An old woman working on the favorite song
Dogs may bark but the caravan moves along

Standing at the crossroads where the middle meets the ends
And I'm hope six ways to Sunday, by some long lost friends
And I thought I heard the river that runs right through my past
I hollered which way are you going, I heard I thought you'd never ask

I'm a voice of wind and water, a man of flesh and bone
I was right next to the river, together and alone
Sometimes you glimpse the truth when it's long gone
Dogs may bark but the caravan moves along

I stumbled drunk upon a side street without a clue, without a care
I saw the wind move on the water just enough to know it's there
And I felt my world was slipping and my knees went weak
And I might as well let the stars are floating all around my feet

You tried to reconstruct the crime scene with a handful of clues
Think you know where I've been going by staring at my shoes
And if you're gonna talk about me when I'm gone
Dogs may bark but the caravan moves along, the caravan moves along",Dogs May Bark
Stephen Bruton,"The night like ships that drift the clouds float by
They brought no rain, they brought no dreams
The moon kaleidoscopes the ground
The darkness is as sure as death

The moon, above it on a single pearl
Surrounded by her floating sisters
Blink like the eyes of souls to come
Scattered like some broken glass

But under the horizon, under the horizon
Nothing stays the same, the sacred and profane
Under the horizon

This world, it spins so fast, it keeps us down
The shadows move, they stop the sun
Days have no names and fall like leaves
In rhythm to an endless dance

This life, it finds its way in fits and starts
Laughter, tears and broken parts
Like spin one way and never stop
These vision's from a fevered dream

Under the horizon, under the horizon
Nothing stays the same, the guilty and the blamed
Under the horizon",Under the Horizon
Stephen Colbert,"As I walk through
This wicked world
Searchin' for light in the darkness of insanity.
I ask myself
Is all hope lost?
Is there only pain and hatred, and misery?
And each time I feel like this inside,
There's one thing I want to know:
What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding? Ohhhh
What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding?
And as I walked on
Through troubled times
My spirit gets so downhearted sometimes
So where are the strong
And who are the trusted?
And where is the harmony?
Sweet harmony.
'Cause each time I feel it slippin' away, just makes me want to cry.

A game I thought I'd never play
""Romance is a game for fools""
I said and grinned
Then you passed by
And here am I
Throwing caution to the wind

Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head.
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

Mm-mm-mm-mm
Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Fools rush in where wise men never, never, never go
Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
Ah, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

And feel you in my bones

When you're away from home

Because I care for you

Can't move without you knowing

The backyard breeze is blowing back its sacrament

So never compromise

I've only bracelets from
Your open arms
And encouragements

Why can't I talk to you
For when desire's fulfilled
The beans are spilt
Desire becomes love

Can I ever be the one you want
Can I ever be the one you love
What if the tide against us
Proves too strong
We'll have to wait until it gives enough

I put too much in the way
The way you went it seems
Out of my life
And into my dreams

You turn my night to day
But is it love you say
And in that way
I'll never be free

Come close

But wine is all I have

Faces fall before my feet
Like blood onto a clean white sheet 
When I grow old I won't forget
To innocence my only debt.

Barefoot in the snow to make love in the hay 
The stars are bright in the abyss

I explode inside your kiss.

Stephen Duffy,"She's dreamy to the max

I tried to make a joke
You didn't seem to listen
The café was full of smoke
And I was fiercely bitten

The wind outside could bite
But love for you was savage
Was my conversation trite
Or weighed down with luggage?

She's got a lot of problems
She's got a lot of problems
She makes me quiver

The soft suede of her boots
""Admit you are neurotic""
Your Maxfield Parrish suits
""Is style like a narcotic""

But if I can't be debonair
I'll just be gaunt and Gothic
""Can we make a pair?""
Yes, that would be exotic

I love you massively
I love you passively
Tip toe to my kisses
Give me my best wishes

Stephen Duffy,"I wonder who's coming out today
To play in sheltered shopping centres
Sitting around the stagnant fountain
Counting pennies eating peanuts
Brown paper, babies and check out girls
In uniform and furniture boys
Who we used to know don't say hello
But that's okay that's okay

'Cause when the sun comes down
And you come home
We'll have two weeks all alone
Before you have to go back to school
Which ruins everything.

Wednesday Jones is growing up
And if she goes I'll never catch her
On the petrol station forecourt
All thumbs and old suede jacket
Catch the bus back to the house
The front room's ours and we can stay there
Stared out the window for an hour
Until I too went away went away

'Cause when the sun comes down
And we're apart
Another one must claim my heart
And Wednesday Jones and I won't be

to other girls, no less demure).
Tie my shoe lace help me walk
But this time please don't make me talk
There are things I dare not say
Of who I love and in what way
But Geraldine accepts me mute
For silence is a stronger suit.
The leaves have fallen soon will snow

On Geraldine and all those below
The passing years leave vapour trails
Or silver patterns like those of snails
I was quite sure when we passed here
But rain left sky and paving clear.
Love is such a fractured thing
Its splinters slither in our skin
We will never feel complete
With time we always will compete

If I could love her any more
I won't deny that we had fun

More than I can say for some
With just so many years to live
In which nothing gives
Two courting birds wheeled away

Against the opalescent grey

Do you think that one love is good enough for two?

Passed right through her soul like a spear

But we perceive everything has changed
Nothing seems the same so we grieve

And knew that she was doomed
Daisy shot up her savings and traded on the glow
And waited for it to go crazy

Needle mythology is a death trap for you, girl
Why make your drug of choice
Your goodbye to the world?
The astro strings like silken wings

Take you away from everything
You loved about the way you were
The baby doll with daisy hair
And nothing in your way

You're just like Jesus, you die and rise again
Getting high and then scoring
A world betrayed by your hurry to the grave
You know you can't be saved and I'm so sorry

You spread your dreams underneath my feet
For I once bought you sweets
And all the junk that you once did for fun
Has now unhappily been done, now you can't run

Stephen Duffy,"The girl works at the store, sweet Jane St. Clair
Was dazzled by her smile while I shopped there
It wasn't long before I slept with her
I sang her songs while she dyed my hair

Jane, divided but I can't decide what side I'm on
Jane, decided only cowards stay, while traitors run
Jane, Jane

I bought her gold , frankincense and myrrh
She thought that I was making fun of her
She made me feel I was fourteen again
She thinks it's safer if we'd just stay friends

Jane doesn't think a man could ever be faithful
Jane isn't giving me a chance to be shameful
Jane, Jane

I wrote a letter, she should have got it yesterday
That life could be better by being together
Is what I cannot explain to Jane

The girl works at the store, sweet Jane St. Clair
Still dazzled by her smile while I shoplift there
No promises as vague as Heaven
No longer Lawrence to your Vivian

Jane, desired by the people at her work and school
Jane is tired, 'cause every man becomes a lovesick fool

Swaying to the rhythm set up by the breeze

These things I can not find
But when I think I'm all played out
A song will come to mind

Stephen Duffy,"I can't find the path I took that brought me here
I can't find the arms that held me in my fear
I can't remember names and places
Forgotten prayers and social graces
All misplaced in the hands I shook
And sprawling with the drugs I took

The waitress' story ends
So I leave the table and go to my waiting friends
I'll never be the same again
Star crossed and ill begotten world

That beats us every time
And now the only shadow here is mine
And I'm too tired to chase it
Across the Friday morning sky
Another day unfolds it's pictures

I trust the confusion that made us meet
Each sick note and turncoat that made him cheat
Now I know that it's worth trying
To cherish those that stop us crying
Who make us feel we're not alone
And help us roll away the stone

",The Waitress' Story
Stephen Duffy,"I was born in Birmingham
But soon I would escape
With education incomplete
But two songs on a tape

When my girlfriend was expelled
We took the London coach
Her sister gave her daffodils
Her mother an old brooch

And she smiled
And she smiled and she smiled
She was so beautiful, 17
She was so beautiful, 17

We didn't have much money then
No Hi-Fi or TV
So, we made love, I'd sing her songs
And she would read to me

But we were young
I didn't know what love was all about
And when I slept with her best friend
Of course she threw me out

And we cried
And we cried and we cried
She was so beautiful, 17
She was so beautiful, 17

I was looking for a deal
Looking for a hit
The affectations of success
The airs that goes with it

While she was looking for a man
Who didn't need a maid
She modeled for an agency
Who made sure she got paid

And she smiled
And she smiled and she smiled
She was so beautiful, 17

Stephen Duffy,"I was born in poverty but when I was about nineteen
I wrote a song called 'Kiss Me', and soon it was pay day
A terraced house in that country, I thought that would do for me
It's seemed to be the lilac time, but when the lilac died
I went back to town and cried, I need someone who'll always love me

The day after someone dies, waking little lesser lies
Why do the wicked seem to survive, Eucharist song
We're little more alone, the moments took that were never known
They'll never see my happy home, you see them everyday
I know you want to say, you won't forget we'll always love you

When you're young and you fall down and cry
When you're old and you fall down and died
I am in between, there will never be
Anywhere or sincere with anyone that I find dear

Checking in around twilight, the hotel where we board the tonight
I run a path and pack some books, which we will embrace
Told me that your father died, when you buried him you cried
You're sorry and you are surprised, he died and you were born
So you don't have to mourn, live your life alone, always love you
Love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you",Eucharist
Stephen Duffy,"I don't remember receiving your postcard
I never got much post so it shouldn't have been too hard
You were on holiday with your school in some French town
And when you were away I took Debbie to the crown

I feel as though the past is closing in on me
I found a photograph of me and Kimberly

I found your postcard and I put it on the wall
I found your picture, you know tears were bound to fall
I didn't write your songs when we were going out
So why should I start now, you are not about

I feel as though the past in closing in on me
I found a photograph of me and Kimberly

We hardly used to even drink, we didn't smoke
We'd walk home from the pub 'cause we were always broke
So when your mother called and said that you were dead
Thought she's talking of another Kim instead

I feel as though the past is closing in on me
I found a photograph of me and Kimberly

She said it seemed you accidentally overdosed
It was so long since I talked to her and once we were so close
And I am left with all these things I didn't say
And a picture of you in my arms, the day you went away

I feel as though the past is closing in on me
I found a photograph of me and Kimberly

I feel as though the past is closing in on me
I found a photograph of me and Kimberly

Where you wrote, love is all, you meant it you know you did
Where others see the mother of another child
I still see, your eyes ablaze and wild outside your faculty

The crutches and addictions of everyday

To serve while kissing all their holes
Did I pretend to be their truest friend'

You are open to all of my suggestions
But you are better for none of my pretensions

They get their way most times
But you'll get your way this time
You cannot stay in this hole
You'll get away this time

Warm with wayward hope
Your kisses breathless, your love divine
You left drama school for shop floor
Restless, not by design

You are tired of provincial boutique, Sundays
You want the mythical New York
And Champs Elyse

They get their way most times
But you'll get your way this time
You cannot stay in this hole
You'll get away this time

Never try to profit with fortune you can't stop it
I'm afraid you will succeed
To find what capitals are cleaner
The grass is so much greener
Please don't ever go to seed

But you'll get your way this time
You cannot stay in this hole
You'll get away this time

Stephen Duffy,"I'm lying to myself
But I don't know if I'm prepared to listen
The answer is skin deep
Where can I find a simpler complexion?

Maybe I can, maybe I can't
Maybe a baby or maybe a plant
I could buy a gun, a new pair of shoes
I'll make you unhappy
So don't make me choose

Between the devil I know, the devil I don't
A lover who loves me and a lover who won't
Accept that I'm so confused
About love and love I have refused

I'll get a lot of ink out of our affair
I'll get a lot of ink out of our affair
It's over the kitchen sink with flowers in our hair
But baby, I don't care

I want what I can't have
But if by chance I get it I don't want it
I want to hold your hand
But holding hands holds
More demands than answers

Give me a kiss, give me a break
Give me a miss 'cause I won't stay awake
Beyond the flattery dash caught in a crush
A moment of pash before the pregnant hush

Is it two hearts or three? Shaken or stirred?
Give me an answer or give me the bird
Oh, won't you tell me about the loves in your life?
You're nobody's fool and nobody's wife

You, you execute love's pas de deux
But you think you're just par for the course
And your kisses have no strings attached
And your love is always left on the latch

You're such a sweet thing
Not a catch phrase or a dance craze
But the nature of my success
Seems to make your tears jingles for singles

Stephen Duffy,"In the summer and her pinafore
She thought she'd love for ever more
How soon things sour

Past the bewitching hour she finds
Herself in winter deep inside her coat
The past is just an anecdote
She can't forget for it's her alphabet of time

Will there be a war
Will she die or will she know?
And find the pain of youth still shows?

Like Mary Tyler-Moore
She stares across the yawning tide
Out of love and terrified

In the Sunday color magazine
She reads a line and then she dreams
Of what she'll do when she leaves you again

She knows that home
Was once a wild unknown
As always her own chaperon
Catch the bus from wilderness or to

Hold on tight, catch that bus
Fares please, ding ding ding

Now you've got the money

Then you might just see it's not so funny

Prey tell
The wishing well will get you eventually
Beware
What you are is what you're doing there

Love is lingering with you on it's mind
And it's giving you a moment so kind

Believe
Your broken heart could heal so dramatically
And with a little luck
You could see a better way again real soon

As we stare into each other's eyes
And each year just goes so fast and goodbye

Look around
What your friends are telling you so free
Be gone
It's all over as the sun does set once more

If you think that love has a chance with you
Maybe hope can shine a light so true

Just smile
You can win the victory so sweet
And know
It's just another day for you and me

And tomorrow ? no more sorrow
You can all her - if you want to

There's a new way ? why won't you try it
Heaven sent it and you'll believe it now

Love can save you now
Love can save you now
Love can save you now

Evening brings romance to lovers as they stroll along
Night time brings rest to the weary
Sooths all the hearts that are dreary
Leaves us alone with our day dreams
Brings back sweet golden love dreams while we sleep, sleep, sleep

Won't you please just tell me why

Oh, you took my soul

Stephen Hill,"Life is like a mountain railroad
With an engineer that's brave
We must make the run successful
From the cradle to the grave
Watch the curves, the hills, the tunnels
Never falter, never quail
Keep your hand upon the throttle
And your eye upon the rail

Blessed Savior, thou wilt guide us
Til we reach that blissful shore
Where the angels wait to join us
In thy praise for evermore

You will roll up grades of trial
You will cross the bridge of strife
See that Christ is your conductor
On this lightning train of life
Always mindful of obstruction
Do your duty, never fail
Keep your hand upon the throttle
And your eye upon the rail

You will often find obstruction
Look for storms of wind and rain
On a hill, or curve, or trestle
They will almost ditch your train
Put your trust alone in Jesus
Never falter, never fail
Keep your hand upon the throttle
And your eye upon the rail

As you roll across the trestle
Spanning Jordan's swelling tide
You behold the union depot
Into which your train will guide
There you'll meet the superintendent
God the father, God the son
With the hearty, joyous plaudit
""Weary pilgrim, welcome home""",Life's Railway to Heaven

It took a while but I found out the truth
If nothing gold can ever stay you take the cards you’re dealt today
And make them into something you can use
The dreams I had when I was younger, some so wild and filled with wonder
Some that I have failed to recognize
For all these kids and all this noise and all that time spent with the boys
I don’t know why it comes as a surprise

That I don’t want to die on the road
Some place that is not my home
I’ve been wrong before but this I know, that I don’t want to die on the road

If rock n’ roll can save your soul
It’s also gonna take its toll 
You get the things you give
And I gave this a lot
Buddy Holly, Stevie Ray, Harry Chapin, Jim Croce  but not my name today

If it’s something you don’t want to hear, then keep your hands upon your ears
Remember though that there will come a time 
When all you’ve said is all you’ll say, you might as well kill me today 
If this is all I’m gonna leave behind

The song of a woman and a man who lived in strife.
He was tired of being poor and he wasn't into selling door to door
And he worked like the devil to be more.
A different kind of poverty now upsets me so. 

Night after sleepless night, 
I walk the floor and I want to know, why am I so alone?
Where is my woman can I bring her home? 
Have I driven her away? Is she gone?
Morning comes to sunrise and I'm driven to my bed.
I see that it is empty and there's devils in my head.

Wonderin' who I am listenin' to the sound
He knows the best and the worst of me now
I don't think I could go on if I let him down

[Chorus]

So my love do the things you got to do
Never have to be afraid, I'm always with you
Believin' in me and you like Christopher does
Believin' is the magic that makes one from the two of us

[Chorus]",To Mama from Christopher and the Old Man
Stephen Stills,"I thought I knew you
I guess I took myself
Right down the wrong road
Leading to the past

I know you're trying
To rearrange your mind
But you were lying
Do you laugh in my face

Turn back turn back the pages
Who remembers names
Who remembers faces
Turn back don't drive yourself crazy

Life's too short for ritualistic chases
Maybe tomorrow
You'll find you have to cry
And in your sorrow

See the mirror it doesn't lie
Just like the last time
You try to pull me down
You are the past time

And blind and death to sound
Turn back turn back the pages
Who remembers names
Who remembers faces

Turn back don't drive yourself crazy
Life's too short for repetitious changes
No use denying
You wasted my time

And caused the crying
And the bitterness to hide
Just trying to prove
You need nobody else

But you're bound to lose
Lying to yourself
Turn back turn back the pages
Who remembers names

Who remembers faces
Turn back don't drive yourself crazy
Life's too short for ritualistic chases

Was There Something Else That I Could Do? Or Was It Over?

Oh My Precious My Soul Says To My Blue Eyed Sparrow
Come Back, Come Back. I Can Peal Away The Cages
Come Back, Come Back. I Can Put Away The Rages
Come Back, Come Back. Can We Turn The Next Page Together?
Listen To My Bluebird Laugh She Can Tell You Why
Deep Within Her Heart You See She Knows Only Cryin'
There She Sits Aloft At Perch Strangest Color Blue
Flying Is Forgotten Now Thinks Only Of You
Get Into All Those Blues Must Be A Thousand Years
And Each Is Differently Used You Just Know
You Sit There Mesmerized By The Depth Of Her Eyes
I Can Tell You No Lies

To be part of someone
As a true friend is part of me

About the whole world
And most especially one another, oh yeah, all right
And you know, and you know?

And it's hard, yes it is
It's hard, yes it is
And I wonder
I wonder could it be a dream?

You got to tell me, baby

And he cries from the misery
And he lies singin' harmony

It is done so now here must borrow
The life of his brothers
And living in sorrow
Must do for the others

Was that a tear I thought I saw a trace?

How do we save tomorrow

Given a voice can you make a choice
Is it black, is it grey, is it yellow

Mother nature made it green
Prettiest place you've ever seen
People don't know what they need

Open your window
What do you see
Do you remember
How it used to be

All of this crying, while the earth is dying
It's a shock they won't stop because of the money

America is lost, figurin' the cost
You can hang your head in shame
It's disgusting

Goodbye. I can't stop to say

Jump in the Pirogue, pole down the Bayou
Bogue Falaya River was dark and cold
Seven years old, I couldn't find my way home

Old times, good times
Old times, good times

When I was twelve, I learned how to play the guitar
Got myself a job in a jax beer bar
Got myself together, went to New Orleans
Found myself workin' for rice and beans
And it was good times

Old times, good times
Old times, good times

New York city was so damned cold
I had to get out of that town before I got old
California and rock and roll dream
Got too high and we blew our whole scene

Like the backside of a lover's moon
Do we cry out for justice at sunrise
To be cleansed by confessions at noon

Have Mercy

Still my heart is an open secret
Someone tell me have I been gifted or robbed

Just as we seem to end the one act play
We draw so much farther apart
Each new opening, a different time for closing
Will I sing my last symphony to an empty room?

Still my heart is an open secret
Someone tell me have I been gifted or robbed

Most of my life has gone up and down
And I don't see no reason for all this pain

Stephen Stills,"Everybody wants to hear
The music in my head
The price I pay is too much
And I'm winding up in debt
So if you don't mind
I think I'm gonna stay home
I am getting older now
I have no need to roam
I just need a good home

Everybody wants to know
Do I remember what I think
About revolution, mind pollution,
The kind of books I drink
After one last careful look around
I believe that I might like to
Settle down(all right) in a relaxing town

All we ever get to see are the rednecks
And the revolution crazies
Let's rent out Soldier's Field
And have Jerry Rubin versus Mayor Daley
For the benefit of peace
Admission is free
We can all stay home and
Watch it on TV
Call it the supersede",Relaxing Town
Stephen Stills,"Listen to the sound of the night bird singin'
I wonder who he calls
My fingers hurt so bad, it's got me grinnin'
And I wonder can I do it all

Looking out for boulders and falls
A woman she watches from the top of the canyon
Hopin' we don't drown us all

[Chorus]
Help me now, I got to slow down
Hear my singin' call

Hurt myself bad on a run through the desert
Threw a shoe and took a bad fall
Long for the peace that the ancients bring me
Murmur of the lowlands shut my jaw

Some people buy themselves a doll

You can be who you want to be
Just remember that me and you
Ain't all there is

People need trust
People need one another
And that means us

Believe me sugar babe
Everyone knows it ain't easy
But when you get it all together in your heart
It's the easiest thing to do to be pleasin'
Folks ain't made to live apart
People need love
People need trust
People need one another

Let yourself be open honey learn to bend
Remember everyone gets scared

Just like people they're drawn to each other
They don't live in no ivory tower

She is far away
Out of reach
Will she burn her wings
I can only watch
Out of touch
Out of my mind

I wish I could tell
If she's alright
Feeling fine
It's lucky for me
I'm not a jealous man
Out of hand
Out of my mind

When this party's over
Over
I will loose her
To another

Get yourself someone
And then wave goodbye
Don't you cry
Go ahead break your heart
But don't fall apart
It's like saying goodbye
To friends for the first time",To a Flame
Stephen Stills,"Would you knock a man down if you don't like the cut of his clothes
Could you put a man away if you don't want to hear what he knows
Well it's happening right here people dying of fear by the droves
And I know most of you

Either don't believe it's true,
Or else you don't know what to do
Or maybe I'm singing about you,
Who knows.

It's incredibly sick, you can feel it, as across the land it flows
Prejudice is slick when it's a word game, it festers and grows,
Move along quick, it furthers one to have somewhere to go
You can feel it as it's rumblin'

Let emotions keep a tumblin'
Then as cities start to crumblin'
Mostly empty bellies grumblin'
Here we go

People see somebody different fear is the first reaction shown
Then they think they've got him licked the barbaric hunt begins and they move in slow
A human spirit is devoured the remains left to carrion crow
I was told that life is change

And yet history remains,
Does it always stay the same
Do we shrug it off and say
Only God knows

By and by, somebody usually goes down to the ghetto
Try and help but they don't know why folks treat them cold
And the rich keep getting richer and the rest of us just keep getting old.
You see one must have a mission
In order to be a good Christian
If you don't you will be missing
High Mass or the evening show

And the well fed masters reap the harvests of the polluted seeds they've sown,
Smug and self-righteous they bitch about people they owe,
And you can't prove them wrong, they're so God damn sure they know
I have seen these things with my very own eyes and defended my battered soul,

It must be too tough to die,
American propaganda, South African lies
Will not force me to take up arms, that's my enemies' pride,
Ands I won't fight by his rules that's foolishness besides,

His ignorance is gonna do him in and nobody's gonna cry,
Because his children they are growing up and plainly tired of putting up
With bigots and their silver cups
They're fed up, they might throw up
On you",Word Game
Stephen Stills,"Unless you believe in magic
There ain't much left you can be

Ain't it a crime
How we got to buy time
It happened once before, you know
In 1932
But now there's so many more of us

Always willing to compromise
Their love and their tomorrow

We don't have to lose the faith
That gave us this much hope
Let us blow with the wind
To seek out the fountain of life
And all its miracles, its miracles

And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way
And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There'll be a load of compromisin'

But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

Gettin' cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone

Stephen Stills,"Have you ever been down deep?
I mean way down under the ocean
Just inside Odin's reach
Better beware of this potion

And remember you don't belong
It always seemed so unfair
The fishes around will always remind you
Got to go slow, take it easy down there
You've only so much air

When you get a little deeper
If you slow down you might keep her
The sea, unforgiving and she's hard
But she'll make love to you
Show you glimpses of the stars

At about two hundred feet
You realize the peril
But seductive is the deep
That shark over there holds no terror

For a while you really belong
The ocean will always share
You become one like friends and lovers
But remember, take care, she'll try to keep you there

The deeper you go
'Cause of the pressure of the air
The nitrogen comes and goes, gets you high
It's an alien atmosphere

They call it rapture of the deep, be you not afraid
You're too far down by now to be scared
Two hundred and eighty-seven feet
I saw Jesus and it made sense that He was there

So belong but don't be long
There's plenty of ocean to share
Please take heed, there's mouths to feed
The ocean, she'll provide
Don't take more than you need
'Cause Heaven just might be the sea",Black Coral
Stephen Stills,"I was lonesome as I could be in a bad kind of time
Till I saw you look at me where the smoke is fine
All of my troubles disappear when I watch you move
Girl, your body said everything and I know you knew

I want to make love to you, yeah
(Love you, love you, love you, love you)
Make you feel all right
I want to make love to you, oh yes I do

'Cause the time that we had was such a rush
And you're such a lady

I knew this night was ours, it doesn't matter
I'll be gone with the dawn, so will you
We choose, who we choose, when we choose

Nobody can take away the time we had
Each moment extra long it's quite a memory to have
Don't you forget with the dawn I'll be gone
And how we got together, anyway well, that's another song

What lies between us
It can be set aside and ended

Everyday we learn more how to hate
Shut the door
And then we'll tell ourselves we can't relate

Only to the ones who are the same
Yet even they are different
And ever so they shall remain

All are strangers, all are friends, all are brothers
Open up my friend and learn to hear
For even lying
When it has nothing you should fear

If you cannot let yourself be
Known by anyone
Then you are hiding and not whole
All are strangers, all are friends, all are brothers

We your children we would ask you all
Please do not hide your eyes
And listen when we will call
We will whisper shout or make a scene

We are the answer
For we can live the peace we dream
All are strangers, all are friends, all are brothers

Are askin' everybody some questions about how it is
Yes America's children
Are makin' it hard to look them in the eyes whoa it is

All I can think of it's such a disgrace
There's so much good man going to waste

Eyes of reflecting faces

Now you can see what the fear does

I still see her standing by the water

Stephen Stills,"Certain my heart, too much impaired
My life was falling into disrepair
I was beginning to despair
Of finding love at all

No one gave me a second look
Fewer still knew of a good book
She said, ""I would if I didn't
Have to work so hard""

And her eyes turn green
When she's feeling love
When she's feeling bad they
Turn blue

They're hazel when she works
Until she sees
That my love can change her
Grey eyes, back to green for me

Told me I caught her at her worst
Saw the confusion and the hurt

Stephen Stills,"There's no hiding place down here
There's no hiding place down here
I ran to the rocks to hide my face
The rocks said there's no hiding place
There's no hiding place down here

Did you hear the sport
On the TV holding forth
About war, nukes and victory
He was dreaming of course
But he runs the Air Force
And he's talking about World War III

And there's no hiding place down here
There's no hiding place down here
I ran to the rocks to hide my face
The rocks said there's no hiding place
There's no hiding place down here

Then of course we got the clowns
With the plan that they got down
Keep the world paralyzed in fear
Keep the peace, keep the strength
And the Rooskies on the brink
More and better, bigger faster missiles here

There's no hiding place down here
There's no hiding place down here
I ran to the rocks to hide my face
The rocks said there's no hiding place
There's no hiding place down here

With no hand upon your fate
All the prophets do await
Either ending or ten thousand years
You can do just as you will
You can live or you can kill
There ain't no hiding place down here

There's no hiding place down here
There's no hiding place down here
I ran to the rocks to hide my face
The rocks said there's no hiding place
There's no hiding place down here

So before it is too late
Let there be no mistake
There ain't no hiding place down here
Only faith is not absurd
In the Master's chosen words
There is no hiding place down here

There's no hiding place down here
There's no hiding place down here
I ran to the rocks to hide my face
The rocks said there's no hiding place
There's no hiding place down here

Yes, there's no hiding place down here
There's no hiding place down here
I ran to the rocks to hide my face

If we ever got it right
One thing I know for sure
You ain't had no man that's yours
Ever do right by you

When you came
Into my life, I was in trouble too
Were no flame
But to give up love ain't worth
These blues

I was driving myself crazy
I was wasted, I was down
Weren't no time for bein' lazy
Pleasin' everybody 'round
Had some trip I had to deal with
Weren't no love that I could feel it

What I've been through
Time for a big change
General overhaul of your attitude

Stephen Stills,"When I look
And my eyes finally meet a lady
Who has something unique
I must know her
Don't stumble on my feet
Get together
At least just enough to speak
To this stranger
If I dream, I'm bound to lose my place
Fascinated, with this beautiful face
Watching her eyes
There focusin' on me
Pay attention, she is talking to me
I'm the stranger
Tryin' to remember that getting it wrong
Is what everyone does
Mutual attraction can be so
Distracting, forget where you were
Strangers can fall in love
When you think about love at all
And you wind up cryin' the blues
And the lonelies person that you know
Is starin' out of the mirror at you you you
Are the stranger
And you know the danger
It'll be right
And you know that she's
With you
She ain't thinkin'
About what she's supposed to do
Worry'in
Might as well just be pretendin'
Hurryin'
When you know every new
Friend is a stranger",Stranger

Your heart turns cold

I remember the first girl
That I really loved
However it hurt her
She loved me enough
I wanted to wander
She knew I would go
She shed a tear knowin'
That I'd be alone

Painfully I was most aware how
Very unfair it was
Leavin' her suddenly just like that
Goin' God knows where I was
Chasing a rainbow

She was a prophet
She told me I should
Follow my heart
Like I'd been told
Seek out your vision
Before you get old
Isn't it so?
Now many years later
I finally see
How much she did love me
She set me free
Her last few dollars
Put gas in my car
She said ""Promise to write me
Wherever you are""
From out on the highway
I think I wrote twice
I always remembered

Love is a secret
That everyone knows
Try too hard to hide it
It never will show

Living on a mountain
Far away
I saw girl

Gypsy woman deepest in the world
When she moved it was a dance
We hid ourselves
And I had no chance

For the treasure of the oneness
That like sand becomes a diamond
Before the wind
And while I changed my strings

A rocky mountain woman
Came to town to sing
Took my heart and ran
When she bade me follow

I just took her hand
I began my journey to the east
A country boy searching for my peace
In the treasure of the oneness

That like sand becomes a diamond
Before the wind
I sit in deep reflection
There are no answers

To my questions
Where did they go
And which one took my heart
Which one took my soul

I may never see it clearly there comes another
Now she turns to beckon me with the Devil's key
The treasure of the oneness
Then becomes sand and lies there naked
Before the wind",The Treasure

I know we can work it work it out
Together

But look hiding behind the walls
Closing doorways to the hall
Nothing ventured nothing gained
What's your game

Just take a look at that blackened tree
It is not for the cause of me
But a stranger was passed there long
And he stepped right in-between us

Picture of empty places
Eyes of reflecting faces
Now your fast emptiness
Now you can see what the fear does

You go hiding behind walls
We can tear away the wall
Change the shutters from the hall

Becomes clearly quite a statement
That's what you get for playing your game",What's the Game?

I wasn't going to go look for him

Bad place to get a grip
Got a band of famous men
Next thing you know
They took me round the bend
Round the bend

We got down on to some magic places
But the peoples around all had four faces
Couldn't stand such an honest heart
They couldn't wait to tear us apart

Mr.Charlie, yeah, you know I worked hard for you
Ah but you're mean to me, just as mean as you can be
You and Ole Man Trouble
You can't get me now 'cause my mind is free

And my pockets, Lord, you know they're so empty
I got no place to lay my weary head

Do y'all get what I'm saying?
'Cause my heart is in my song
My song blowing in the breeze

Ole Man Trouble, you can't get me now

Somewhere out yonder

Can't nothing but wonder how it got free

But you all want a piece of me
Come out of the shadow
Which you do tell
Go a-dream out ya river
Into a wishing well (yeah)
What y'all think I need
All want a piece of me
Like I am
Don't you know it's a hunger
I can't stay away
There's a sigh and a thunder
Needs playing
Know where I'll be

Stephen Stills,"Cuando sientes que tu amor
Va saliendo de tu vida why nunca regresara
Cuando ella diga ""Adios why buena suerte
No estoy interesada, tu amor no vale nada""

There comes a time when love becomes a trial
And some they will survive and some are sure to fail
No matter what you do it's not enough
For she is as sure as she can be
That she no longer cares to love you

So go on alone, your future is your own
For she has told you now
The time has come to follow different paths

How long will it take you to forget her?
How long for the love to finally die?
How long will her spirit live within you?
Help me, I can no longer cry

So take your life in hand and live it day by day
One moment at a time 'til death comes to collect you
Remember all the love, beyond just simple caring
Obsessively compelling, but ultimately so telling

Why parece que sabeÂ­as que algan dea
Iba a vivir ese momento ya pasado
No mientas ya no llores por tu amor
La vida continea, olvida tu dolor, hermano meÂ­o
Todo todo ha pasado estaba destinado

It took me too much time to realize that it was over
There was no more me and you
Now my life has changed completely
There's an empty place that once belonged to you, yeah

I gave up on you, that's the hardest thing I've ever had to do
Giving up on you, I gave up on you I have nothing left to lose
Even though I know you'll never really face yourself
Or put your trust in someone else that's just the same
As asking all of us to turn away and just give up on you

Every day is different for me now
The air is clear, and the daily worry too, all the time
Easier to repossess, my confidence was weak
I was trapped in loving you

I gave up on you even with the sadness it would surely bring
I gave up on you, I gave up on you even knowing what I do
I was giving up the pain of living without you
My life will never be the same
So I will once again do as you wish, give up on you

I feel so common now my love of decades
Won't you really pass too late?
Hatred's born of demons must be driven from destruction
Now must fight for its own sake

I gave up on you, I'd no more time to waste
I gave up on you, I'd harder things to face
I gave up on you, I've finished with the chase
I gave up on you, while I can still forget the bitter taste
And memories that overcome me seeming to be trying to convince me
That life is nothing but a time to waste, I gave up on you",Spanish Suite
Stephen Stills,"As I lie beside you, feeling the life that we made with our souls
Nothing like this ever happened to me
I seem to react to a vague memory
This is the way that she said it could be
Having a magical child
As I stand before you, watching the love turn around in my eye
I've waited for so long for someone to care
I've waited for so long for someone aware
I've waited for so long for someone to share
Having a magical child
Really makes me wonder why I waited for so long to
Bring another life to this place
Then I finally realized I was watching myself grow up
Can you not see it in his face, your face
Really makes me wonder why I waited for so long to

Stephen Stills,"In an upstairs room in Blackpool
By the side of a northern sea
The army had my father
And my mother was having me

Military Madness was killing my country
Solitary Sadness comes over me
After the school was over and I moved
To the other side

I found a different country but I never
Lost my pride
Military Madness was killing the country
Solitary sadness creeps over me

And after the wars are over
And the body count is finally filed
I hope that The Man discovers
What's driving the people wild

Military madness is killing your country
So much sadness, between you and me

Stephen Warbeck,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

In a stranger's tear
