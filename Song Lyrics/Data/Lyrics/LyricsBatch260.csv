Latin Giants of Jazz,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Everything happens to me",Everything Happens to Me

Latin Playboys,"I remember Cuca
With red lips and ink black hair
In the picture that I found
Underneath the stairs

I can see her dancing
When the music was low and slow
In shiny dress and jewelry
Somewhere there used to go

That was so long
When the red car would always ride
Way on up to Spring Street
Down the tracks to the other side

They pulled over and dropped her
At the house so late at night
She waved her keys and said goodbye
And went inside to cry

I guess she had some babies
And two more after that
They grew up men and ladies
And some got old and fat

She got a call from Tony
""What happened yesterday
When a man came down to see you?""
She didn't have much to say

",Cuca's Blues
Latin Playboys,"I went to see that La Lola just to tell her what I'd done
The things inside my hands were far away from gone
What happens to a kid La Lola when he grows up brown?
Said, ""Sit down and let me tell you if you wanna stick around""

Poured some coffee in a cup made of Mexican clay
""Sit down right in that chair and listen what I say
Richer men, poorer men, dumber men, sure men
Who would ever think that they were all made the same""

I laid down on the sofa and fell asleep just yesterday
And in my sleep a guy in white came up to me to say
""Bet you're wondering why everybody else gets all the breaks
While your mama and your papa and your sister's turning gray""

Made a cup of something hot, some kinda Hindu brew
Listen to me good 'cause this is all I have for you
Doesn't matter who you are, this side or that side of the fence
Or you got a pile of money or you can barely pay the rent

When you die and they take you and they put you in the ground
No matter who or what you are, you'll end up looking brown

You end up looking brown

Ayy papa, do we have to take the truck?
Why not, you can sit in back and watch the movie
What if it gets cold? Come on, put a jacket then and hurry up

Mom, can't we take Lily's Celica, we can all fit
Look Mija, that's your padre and he likes stuff like that
Well, I don't especially when he drops me off at school
It's embarrassing

I could go to school with Lily
Or I could always walk, it's not that far
Get off Dad's case, moco, he's ruco
That's his troca, what do ya want

Don't call me that, you stupid
I'm just saying, I am now announcing
That Ironsides is now ready for boarding for our trip

Latin Playboys,"This is all about the Locoman
Who tried to cut the world in two
Wrapped it up in chicken wire
And tried to drag it home

The grass and trees and roses
Mixed in with the sand and sea
Laid it out across the table
And got down on his knees

This is all about the time he stumbled
And tore a hole up in the sky
The clouds and thunder rumbled
Like a big truck driving by

This is about the Locoman
Who was messed up over you
He grew to the size of a mountain
That was all that he could do

",Loco Man
Latin Playboys,"So the big ole boy looks like he had enough
Still he could use a little mustard
Sits and laughs and talks about his groovy life

Get back!
When you got it, makes you want some more
Don't want to share a single bit

Come back!
When you ain't got, makes you want it more
And already it's running out
And already it's running out

When the next door Joe goes off into the dark
Lookin' around for some mustard
While Maria boils a bone in a big black pot
Tastes like the kind made by her mother

Get back!
When you got it, makes you want some more
Don't want to share even a bit

Get back!
When you ain't got, makes you want it more
And already it's running out

When Anastasio fell he was by then the first Somoza
To have had Nicaragua like a kingdom along his blood-
Line
Where the national guard wore the family crest
In a family business tied to the west
But he was overthrown by those who would share their
Land with millions
Overthrown by those who would be free of the ox's life
But to our shame the west would aim to cut that freedom
Down

Burn Again! Must Nicaragua burn again
Burn Again! Must Nicaragua burn again
Because the USA's got the need to-day
To be born again
Born again Must Nicaragua burn again

The USA begins in a war of independence
When liberty stood tall in the constitution
But that torch today casts a giant doubt
When the senate sends the contras out
To hunt them down, hunt them and destroy the free
Elections
And it is to our shame the west would aim
To cut that freedom down

Burn Again! Must Nicaragua burn again
Burn Again! Must Nicaragua burn again
Because the USA's got the need to-day

Latin Quarter,"They're growing pines now in cotton soil
Still making boxes for the sons of toil
Still bend your back to pick you food stamps up
Black coffee still comes in a tall white cup
They took the signs down but it's loud and it's clear
You want to eat? Well now, it can't be here

Tell me how long the train's been gone
Tell me again about the dream
Tell me the story of glory hallelujah
And how we're swimming against the stream

More talk of marching on Washington
It never really seems to get things done
Along the way we maybe make good friends
But they can't tell us where the rainbow ends
It's getting more now than just out of reach

You asked me what's my pleasure

Pleasure's real or is it fantasy?
Reel to reel is living rarity

Meet meet, meet me at the turnstile

All the denouncement, had absolutely no effect.
Parents and counselors, constantly scorn them.
But people are still having sex and nothing seems to stop them.
Do you realize that people are still having sex?
They've been told not to, perhaps they are perplexed.
When you see them holding hands, they're making future plans to engage in the activity.
Do you understand me?

Lust keeps on lurking.
Nothing makes them stop.

Perhaps it's quite fashionable.
It hasn't gone out of style.
It's a fact that people are still having sex.
It's rather obvious, it's just what one expects.
The evidence is all around.
That everyone in every town has had it one time, or another in their life.
At this very moment people are still having sex.
In a downtown condo, or street in the projects.
Although you can't see them or hear their breathing sounds.

While they keep talkin' 
Talk, talk, talkin, 
Chicken heads keep squawkin' 
Power of the spoken word is infinite 
You can tell 
'Cause people are always talking 
Talking on the run, talking while walking, 
Talking in line, talking in circles, 
Talking in time all over the world 
Talkin' 'bout whatever's on their mind- that's fine 
Talkin' 'bout who they hawkin, who they watchin, who they clockin, 
Who they heard was up to something poppin' 
Always talkin' about who they remember and who's forgotten 
Who's rockin' the set and who's floppin', droppin' out 
Talkin' 'bout people from the cradle to the coffin 
Talkin' 'bout people, talkin' 'bout people, talkin' 'bout people, 
Talkin' 'bout people non-stop talkin' often

People talk shit 
Their minds reinforce it 
Spittin' out words and thoughts that are amorphous 
Pushin' sloppy sound out of their vocal orifice 
Like it ain't bein' recorded 
Sometimes a words scorch is worse than torches 
What's more 
Is the talk ain't uniform or rehearsed 
It's the richest, the poorest,
From CEO boardrooms to porches to alley ways and gutters 
From coast to coast, east to west, south to north 
It's people talking of course! 
Like life is a courtroom 
Most bullshittin' from midnight to high noon and back again 
Blacks and the Blacker thans 
Whites and the Africans 
Far to little action far to much satisfaction 
In philanderin' usin' sex like a sedative 
Repetitive like rhetoric 
I'm bettin' ya think ya nice 'cause you give free add-vice right? 
But unless you got a tight alternative it's best to let it just live! 
And raise the octave up to the positive 
Even though they try and stop you up 
Arteries cloggeded 
The Black man targeted that's how they set it off, they said it 
But in the end it will be only them that's effected by they negative vibe 
I know it hurts, there is no indigestion worse 
Than that which comes from having to eat your own words, 
I heard two people need not bicker in a burning home 
But some people know how to live everybodies life but their own so, 
Here's the poem dedicated 
To the hatred propagated by the ill-fated 
Snakes that's waitin' in grass 
Those that talk the most got the least to say 
But that ain't nothin' new 
And it ain't even really all that

I kept hearing the waves crashin' beneath me 
Back and forth 
They just rephrased what they were saying 
Over and over, doing that repeatedly 
They'd crash and come back 
Its just a constant thing 
Every time they'd back out to sea 
Its like they'd draw just a little more out of me 
A lot of images and feelings 
Just a limitless release 
And I began to reminisce freely 
It was a cinema 
Featuring me and a cast of emotions 
That demanded my attention immediately 
I had previously put them on hold 
On the back burner since earlier 
I didn't want to deal with it 
At that time I felt like other things were pertinent 
Now I see its permanent unless I get real with it 
And it ain't that I don't love to tussle 
Especially mentally 
'Cause I generally do win 
Might not win at first, but definitely eventually 
'Cause I ain't never not been a shoe-in since birth 
But now, this is special though 
See, this is beyond my threshold 
I'm accustomed to just a conventional struggle 
With two opponents 
Only here the tussle's between you and the truth 
So ultimately I'm gonna lose 
Actually I gain though 
I gotta be honest with myself, or else 
I impede my personal progress 
I think it's better to be depressed for a minute 
Admit it, and get re-oriented 
Instead of being a bitter cynic isn't it?

Mooo baby 
We can make it happen
Make it through baby 
All we need to do is begin rejuvenating 
Keep it all in focus and pursue it faithfully 
Do it patiently

I'm getting older 
Everybody around me acts all sober 
Lookin' poker faced 
I started losing hair at the corners 
Matter-of-fact, I looked up top 
That whole border's jacked 
Nobody's gonna chauffeur me anymore 
Whatever this is, we all go through it I guess 
It's just awkward 
I'm not a hundred percent comfortable with 
The rate that everything's developing at 
It's just a little overwhelming at times 
I'm dealing with hella shit to process 
It's new data daily 
There's really no preparing for this thing 
Or, maybe it's mainly just me acting strangely 
Just me facing the challenge 
I doubt it though 
'Cause I met thousands of people 
Seen something similar in their faces 
It's like the outlook is changing 
I think it's called bein' a man in the making 
It's burnt, I like pralines now 
Long walks solo, where I can sort my thoughts out 
Just what I've been taught to date 
It doesn't gel well with the way that I've been feeling these days 
That's coming from a ton of angles, hella places 
I'm really not trying to make a political statement 
But just in terms of internally inside
I'm at an interval in life where it's a turbulent time 
And I could pretend that it's all good 
And that I shouldn't put so much on it 
Let it sit and just settle itself 
Stop acting all sobby and sentimental 
Besides everything's perfectly fine 
But here I am on this balcony 
With my thoughts just traveling randomly on some tangent
And in the back of my mind 
I keep hearing this lady 
Her voice is beautiful, she keeps saying 

Mooo baby 
We can make it happen
Make it through baby 
All we need to do is begin rejuvenating 
Keep it all in focus and pursue it faithfully 
Do it patiently",Balcony Beach
Latyrx,"Burnt pride is a crazy thing 
But now, what does it take to make you feel me concrete? 
I ain't your maitre'd, I ain't on pain relief 
This ain't make believe, I ain't on no ankle leash

Burnt pride is a crazy thing 
But now, what does it take to make you feel me concrete? 
I ain't your maitre'd, I ain't on pain relief 
This ain't make believe, I ain't on no ankle leash

I tried speaking in a rational manner 
Tried to get my point across using regular me(ans) 
I even patterned my delivery 
Similarly after something you had said 
So that you would not interpret me differently, but

My head's on a tree swing 
Your debt's still lingering 
While you erect gates with codes really nobody knows 
I ask, ""Why's it always closed?"" 
I'm told it's my approach 
Well let's suppose 
Just for the sole sake of argument that
Despite the spite and all the ill will you're harboring 
That me, Lyrics Born, all this power that I'm harnessing 
That I didn't come in here to no conquering 
That I came in here to do a little bargaining 
Grease key people do some apple polishing 
Maybe hail a cab for my local congressman 
So he can hook me with the landlord in parliament 
Then I'll set up a booth, hand-pick my operatives 
Train 'em up, send my squad of garbagemen 
To spread the good will, all in the environment 
And all the false doctrine and all the carcinogens, but now 
I gotta be wise 'bout who I'm targeting 
The key is make the young folks offerings 
So that they don't become adults that are demonstrative 
Or else my chances of retirement go spiraling 
So then I work my way into their subconsciousness 
I tell them always use caution, now, cautiousness, because 
Are you absolutely positive that you can make it without us and be prosperous? 
You need to look at me and my accomplishments 
Hey, I got an idea, let's start a partnership! 
It'll be just like livin' in a Harlequin 
And we'll feed our pond fishies ostriches 
We'll feed the starved kiddies self-doubt lozenges 
Just peeling layer after layer off their confidence 
Until it's one planet us homogenous 
Versus one gumball you optimists!!

All right now,
This is what we gonna do,
We gonna
Burn pride! Yes, Burn pride!
Worldwide!
Burn pride! Indeed, Burn pride!

What's up y'all,
This is Lyrics Born
Big bad a's in the place once again
Lady's and gent's, family and friends
No body is owning me

Burnt pride is a crazy thing 
What does it take to make you feel me concrete? 
I ain't your maitre'd, I ain't on pain relief 
This ain't make believe, I ain't on no ankle leash 
I tried speaking in a rational manner

I'm told it's my approach 
Okay, what's appropriate your royal holiness? 
Shall I fan you with foliage in front of an audience? 
Hi-five Napoleon? 
Lo-five a Scorpion? 
Then and only then would there ever be an opening 
Well, that's just your big, wet blanket of power 
You weight us down with double-talk until we think we're insane 
But if you're trying to save your pride 
You're trying to save your pride 
As far as I'm concerned that shit is going down in flames 
With your piddly-ass riddles 
You think I ain't mentally apt 
I see you slither 'round my ankle like I ain't gonna react 
No more me nibblin' on a bridle while you're kickin' my abs 
No more ""everything's Ore-Ida"" when I can't even stand 
No more fiddling with the maps 
No more belittling the past 
No more  when my questions is asked 
No more concessions for an ego so fragile 
Any self-expression chips away at your castle 
Your pride's your damsel, you built your barricade 
I was so careful 
I danced around your insecurities 
On your schedule 
Ignored all your absurdities 
But all the people 
You parody with that dogshit your nurturing 
Then you have the nerve to take certain shit personally 
I didn't even speak a handful and I encroached on your territory

You need therapy there mister Pharisee 
Seriously, 'cause apparently your circuitry's terribly damaged 
How 'bout a nice hot kerosene bath 
I'll come back 
I'll serenade you with flaming arrows oh serpentine 
Your pride needs refurbishing 
I'll extend you that courtesy like

Latyrx,"Cheyenne! Look at what the liquor brings about,
Throw out the magic basket full of wires and let them flail all on the ground.
Why do they love it so?
Hatched seeds of light supported by light seaward breezes, 
And we see these orbs in a car chase of sorts, 
Absorbs sweet Lorraine and her dolly on the front porch and it escorts them into
Deep, dark, space around Taurus, 
And the Mormons can't explain the stars reflectin' in her corneas. 
It makes they hearts beat hard against they corsets which 
Bops they lockets up against they foreheads, and--
Who was it that sent this little girl's mind up into orbit? 
She had to forfeit little dolly while in space so that she could touch the stars like torches. 
Privately, we recorded her, 
Intimately, yes! We courted her with
""Miss Cinnamon Tea, please rest your itty bitty palms in my
Incandescently glowing hands and infinitely, 
We will explore your inquisitive tendencies; 
The intrinsic and the explicit, 
We won't inhibit any of your inquiry, 
But first the fire must be met then quenched by you candidly and randomly venting any 
Thoughts, memories, anything! 
It's time for you to start channeling what you've been gathering!"" 
So we left gravity, 
Instantly engulfing Lorraine in a shimmering cavity then, 
Flattening like an elasticine band that stretches and contorts, 
And then I'd widen like the space highway spiraling sideways, contract and dilate,
Then straighten up at 100 mph then fall on myself in layers like a thickened band of taffy, 
Assuming every length and shape imaginable, 
Then I catapulted Lorraine and her stuffed animal into still deeper space, 
But fathoming what I had actually done and her pace increasing rapidly, 
I shot out like a javelin after her screams, 
First matching her speed, then surpassing her, hearing her laughter as I passed her, 
But the web I spun had not strengthened yet, 
And the momentum sent them stretching through my intentions, And I popped! 
Dolly lost
And Lorraine
Plopped back down into her bedroom, 
And coughed

Born 
The correlation 
Relation shapin' 
The forms 
Are takin' their stations warned 
We're warmed 
The verbal intercourse and mind fornication 
Is on, whine, design is tight, 
Corn burn more than blunts 
Or oil at midnight 
The clock turns, as it often does 
Fight it with all ya might scrub 
Ya learn more if ya listen 
Timing is more than tic-toc-tickin' 
Rippin's a mission so come equipped 
But not with remote clickin's or clips 
In the nine 
Ya mind 
Is fine 
With me 
Brother 
Ya chickens, you caint rhyme 
And punks react violently 
But bad men respond silently 
Later hearing your gone, and the facts while sipping on cognac quitely 
Privately 
Commenting on society 
Modestly, 
Honestly, 
Asking why fools even try it 
When they're undeniably 
And obviously, 
Undoubtedly, 
Decidedly, 
Wack 
I strech out and expand 
In 3-D like 
Galaxies establishing terrestrial contact, like 
Roll up the windows, crank the heat, relax recline the seat, 
And thank Lateef, 
Take two and pass, 
Give it a little gas and ask 
""What's the riddle mean?"" 
Fantastic 
G E=MC2 don't be sarcastic, my mind moves at the speed of light when blasted 
Synchopated audiosyncratic madness 
Concentrated 
Focused 
On the rabbit 
Like I'm rabid, gigantic, teething wolverine 
Armed with claws that bring murderous tragedies 
To even human beings burdened with feelings of sadness 
Ludicrous thang is I'm glad to be the baddest 
Sittin' fattest after I'm finished lunchin', munchin' em 
Before that 
I'm slashin', attackin with rippin' action 
In sound clashes 
Bastard I'm the fastest 
Quick draw 
Like: western classics 
BIG JAW, voice cuts like a saw 
Sprinkling you like Magic 
As the cataclysm hits 
Like SMACK 
Vocabic havoc cracks 
Your sternum, spine, and scapula 
Spectacularly 
Propelling you backwards over the edge 
Of the track

Now that we have made our way away from the sky apple, 
You will notice from your new knowledge experience, 
That the distance from the crust to the mantle to the core, 
Is much greater than previous measurements, 
And as lyricists in this time period we experiment with a myriad of new findings, 
Different from the supposed truths, 
The ample evidence we presented, 
It complemented our argument that ""everything is impermanent"". 
Not static or at settled standstill as the opposite element has suggested is legitimate, 
And finally, as a reminder, 
The precious metals and ores mined for early in the earth's surface sediment, 
Cannot compare to the infinite introspective splendor, 
Represented by the treasures indicative of our entrance into the earth's center, 
Incentive isn't it?

Yes, yes, yes, YES, well, yes, yes, yes, 
You're dealing with lyricists that's fresh, fresh, fresh, 
You wan test surely ya jest, look, lets just get 
One thing correct before ya step focus on breath, breath, breath, 
One rep, 
Breath, breath, breath, 
Select yet another set of styles? Yup, yup, yep, 
Each one as hard as erections I got to flex, flex, flex, 
For project protection I'm collecting text, techs, tex, 
While you're caught up, 
Thinking rap is just sex, sex, sex, 
And more flesh, flesh, flesh, 
Robbing your soul of its precious sensuousness 
Most of these rappers are talking shit out of the side of they neck 
What the heck? 
It's more and more suckas gettin' signed for less, less, less, and less 
And lesson 1: if aiming to impress, press, press, 
You gotta do it yourself 
Quiet as kept, kept, kept, 
If my work is respected I collect checks, checks, checks, 
They cain't all bounce and if they do I got an ounce at the rest 
So I ain't stressin' off that bullshit. 

'Cause I've walked on water weapons baby haven't you heard? 
I've authored songs on different planes and left the boundaries blurred, 
And I taught Neanderthal to use the rotary phone, 
I kicked the devil in his neck without my rosary on. 

And I checked out the vampire's nest 
Sans garlic, dissed his harlots, then without the crucifix 
Plunged the wooden stake deep inside his chest 
Pinned him! 
Thrashing around in the bottom of his sarcophagus 
Writhing around 
Till the only thing left, 
Were little scraps of nothingness 
Those scattered all about infinity

All different shapes and sizes going wherever 

But all of one entity 

That I had brought together for my pleasure 
Watch this now, 

Your last dinner in my chamber where I tempered weapons rendered from a rusty Ford fender, 
You get your steak and eggs, 
Your Caesar vinaigrette, 
Savor your cigarette, 
'Cause I'ma tape your lips, 
Become my marionette, 
You curtsy, pirouette, 
And when my blade caresses, 
I scrape my bayonet, 
You lose your favorite legs, 
I love that fragrance, 
Playful Pet! Yes I'm the patron saint of Dangerous, 
You slaying La-Tyrx? 
You're driving majorettes, 
Over some acreage.

As you sit there pensively, tentatively fidgeting with creation 
But you fuck 'round with this and you'll get aten.

You gettin laid to rest 
Ain't slayin' Latyrx 
You gettin laid to rest 
Over the Sunset's edge",Latyrx

You can't see them!

[Lateef]
One way - a mircophone works
Checkin' suckas on the usage of vocal tones
While the breaks be bangin'
Cold shakin' ya homes
Vibrations reverberatin give identification
In meter Neter like Metu
Leavin' Holes in your speakers
Scold a brotha like Lateef - oh, that's a no can do
The Black and Puerto Rican lyric deacon speaking the truth
I'll make ya giggle like a tickle or a nipple tweaker
I freak a style from here to Mogadishu - here to Mozambique-a
>From here to Mount Zion I'm hard to reach when at my peak
Of shinin' flowin' like a creek lava spicy like paprika
That's neither here nor there
Fully chargin' up the air - heavy sounds gettign thicker like the atmosphere?
Ya gotta get up no it 'cause we got watcha want - the
Beats be fat like the factory Wanka
Suckas keep bitin' like a gang of piranhas
Ya betta come with it if your thinkin' is stronger
The mindset couldn't be any wronger
We roll deep swoll like the island of Tonga
Don't even really need to rock the mic any longer
So I stop!
Pass the mic like I pass on the porkchops

Chorus #1:
And it don't quit
I say that to say this
You can't oppose this
I say that to say this
'cause if the clothes fit
I say that to say this
You're a hostess
I say that to say this

[Lyrics Born]
You're so sensitive
All I said was simple sentences
Premises was left as if the messages were venomous
They are though
Guess it's just my penmanshipt and how it moves
Your torso
Suckas steer clear of me like feminists
Do carshows
There's a little punchline for those of you
Who love rhymes with those in 'em
Hear it one time then you're finished with 'em
Give you that nasty, tangy feeling
Check it out
Free rhymes for griots in Fiats and Klingons
And wee tots with crayons and Koreans
In Reeboks in kiosks at flea marts and peons
That be on some feline shit
y'all like the FBI on some espionage
Asking questions but my head's beyond that
Be openly honest
y'all write ya'll own rhymes?
Oh I doubt it
I's dotted
T's crossed
Tell you what
I make a song
You take it home, you think about it
Promise me with every opportunity you'll use the all illuminating eye
Beyond the obvious buffoonery
Defy the allegations and the rumory
Be out the labyrinth the average imp's enamored with

Chorus #2:
And you don't stop
I say that to say this
Cause with a closed fist
I say that to say this
Youc an't oppose this
I say that to say this
You're just bullshit",Say That
Latyrx,"The past is a thing who approached you and asked if he wrote you a note
And then he quoted you with poems
All the things you pursue, anything to see you front too
Who's zooming who
It's a privilege that's known as lyricism
I must admit this is a bit embarrassing
But can I be characteristically caffeinated
Apple-cinnamon and licorice thoughts of gibberish
And we can reminisce about the history we're making right now
Live a little
Let your whims control your limbs
Let the wind uphold your wings
Let your friends stay home again
Just give into your sins and unfold your linens and unroll your ribbons
Don't give your body time to react, just relax
Just lean back, your seat back
There ain't no need to freak out, just peep out
There ain't no one way to do nothing baby
Sailing through the crab-shoot of life not knowing where we're going
But don't evade me

When I self-emerge myself into a microphone, hey
When I shoot the wind I drift away with oxygen and out of sight I'm gone
There is no stopping time
I'm on cloud number nine
The Cloud of Dreams

See it like this baby
Like you got sunlight and then you got the shade
You got the grass bright green and then you got the pavement
Got your whole life for sights you've seen and things you did
And the gravy
The only place you're staying is the changes that you making
Grow, hold on, try and take it on yourself
But when you do it, when you get it you become, thrown away
But hold on
Know you're strong so keep your grip
Cause they'll be trying there best to trip you
Still, we 'gon carry it home
We've come so far we've got infinite future
Keep the soul, the bloodline flowing on
It's like your mom says, baby-bubba
Don't you worry, pray
You'll discover
A brand new place
Somewhere or another
Where you'll get your things straight
Then in order
Better have your issues covered like the world reporter
Concepts over-flow over air and water
How many people missing this times importance
Every moment that passses seems that time is shorter
Then you reach your ultimate height will all the colors
Represent your life, yourself, just know your culture
Then you'll keep it rooted in your mind of polluted love
Non-convoluted with the righteous result

When I self-emerge myself into a microphone, hey
When I shoot the wind I drift away with oxygen and out of sight I'm gone
There is no stopping time
I'm on cloud number nine

Insist to walk around like a woman

Carries herself like the cutest most purdiest

Go about her business so purpose-fully
She got razor sharp wit and she just won't quit
Flauntin' it, body built like a house made outta bricks
She got the smile, the style and finesse
And bounded with the blessed and profound intellect
Select few have ever seen her butt naked
And they too want to see the rep protected, 'cause

She don't like violence
But she can throw them things so don't let your guard down
Her thighs are soft but her eyes are
You can't just try tell her c'mon now

She ain't known ? she's committed since, and ain't finished shit
But, because of her dis-po-sit-ion, she ain't subject to crit-I-cizm
That's why the other women started mimicking,
She ain't tripping off no images,
Her interests are all limitless, she ain't limited by inhibitions lord
Bout miss imagination, she wants this ? of me jack
That had me out in space, somewhere just floatin' not knowing the way back
You know how I can't always rhythm, everything that you're saying 'bout have the time 
When I hear your voice you support your boys,
But all of that body language girl it's alright
It's alright, it's alright now, a little ride in your ?

I felt fingers push right through

Pretty standing on the top of distinction-
So we sat for a while, on the floor
Of the aisle, of the temple I was
So how about you did you say
Won't there at least come a day 
When we ask ourselves 
""When can we breath again?""
You asked for freedom, 
You asked for patience, you're alive
This tiny trembling is the hand 
Of indecision, all your own
'cause in the end its only I
Someday this will all make sense to me
In between a walking dream or the shadow 
We ask if we cry ourselves aloud
Do the tears in your eyes belong 
To realize our sense?

Every night you've been callin'
Private moments alone
And your heart soon be fallin'
And I know she's a friend
But I can't shake the feeling
That I could be losing your heart

Although she's just a girl that is your friend
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
She shares a special part of you

You said that she's one well to see
How deep you're in love with me
And intentions were not to get in between
But I see possibilities

And you say that you feel
I'm the best thing in your life
And I know it's real, I see it in your eyes
There's no reason for me to even feel this way
I know you just enjoy her company

I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
Although she's just a girl that is your friend
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
She shares a special part of you",Girlfriend
Laura,"Wisst ihr was es ist, das man nicht vergisst?
Alles was ich habe, Erinnerung an die Tage,
Die ich im Herzen trage. Momente im Leben, die mir soviel geben.
Muss immer daran denken, versuch mich abzulenken,
Will kein Mitleid, ist Vergangenheit.
Wie kam es nur soweit? Gegenwart ist da,
Realität nehm' ich wahr 
Es tut so weh, okay,
Versuche nicht zu weinen, interessieren tut es keinen.
Kann es nicht versteh'n es muss gehen das Verlangen dich zu sehn
Hör auf es bringt mich nur schlecht drauf
Es ist soweit die Sehnsucht schreit lässt mich nicht mehr in Ruh
Schuld bist du
Leidenschaft ich spüre sie wie noch nie
Will zu dir komm zu mir jetzt und hier

Immer wieder, immer wieder denk ich an dich
Immer wieder, immer wieder vermiss ich dich
Tausendmal berührt, tausendmal gespürt,
Tausendmal geliebt.

Immer wieder immer wieder denk ich an dich (Immer wieder)
Immer wieder immer wieder vermiss ich dich (ich vermiss dich)
Tausendmal berührt (berührt), tausendmal gespürt (gespürt),
Tausendmal geliebt (geliebt)
Was ist nur passiert?

Ich schrieb dir einen Brief dann rief ich dich an
So begann mein Unglück nichts kam zurück
Jahre sind es her doch der Abschied fiel mir schwer sogar sehr
Traurigkeiten werden mich begleiten
Ein Leben lang an jedem Ort
Warst einfach fort ohne ein Wort
Könnte ich nur schrei'n könnte ich mich nur befrei'n
Von all den Gefühlen die mich so durchwühlen
Mich zerstören kannst du mich nicht hören?
Will das es ein Ende hat ich hab es satt
Sag mir wo du bist wo es ist
Werd dich suchen und dich finden
Kannst nicht so verschwinden
Werd nicht ruh'n werd alles dafür tun
Bis ans Ende der Welt würd' ich gehen um dich nochmal zu sehn!

Immer wieder, immer wieder denk ich an dich
Immer wieder, immer wieder vermiss ich dich

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere

But the thing is, you cant use a
Half lip stitch on China silk, it'll pucker
And you didn't just get this in cause I saw it in last Mays Vogue

Omigod! Omigod you guys!
I'm not about to buy last years dress at this years price

Elle saw right through that sales girls lies

It may be perfect for a
Blonde, but I'm not that blonde
I may be in love,
But I'm not stupid, lady I've got eyes

Omigod! Elle Woods, sorry our mistake

I took a shower, put on a long white dress
Danced for hours, around the flames, around the mess
Poured some champagne, made a toast, said goodbye to all my ghosts
But all that metal, all that steel, are like your words that I still feel

Smiling a lot when you look at your phone

I was blinded by my love
I did everything for you
And now push has come to shove
So lets call the spade to spade
Was it worth the price you paid?
Now I am done, I'm the lucky one
And you can sleep in the bed you made.

Like a wild cat I'm gonna prove it
When we P.A.R.T.Y.

Gonna get my dance dirty
Hope you understand dirty
Gonna get my truck and my boots and my hands dirty
It's gonna be, leave it to me, woo-hoo
One hell of a F.R.I.day night

24 hours every single day
24 carats make solid gold bling
24 bottles in a cold beer case
Coincidence? Maybe

Takin' our dance out of this city
Where the girls are fast and the horses pretty
Gonna get wild and a little bit flirty
Everybody get Kentucky dirty

Out where the bluegrass grows too high,
Odds are good we're gonna drink tonight,
So pour that bourbon straight and sturdy,
Everybody get, everybody get
Everybody get Kentucky dirty

Help me sing this song for my old Kentucky home

In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her!

With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

Laura Branigan,"Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow

I see your face in each shadow on the street below me 
And as I hear the hard rain falling 
I wonder will you be calling, do you still want to hold me? 

I think will you turn away? 
Do you want to say it's over? 
Will you really come? 
Was it just for fun, I wonder 
Is it easy to see, that every time you touch me 

With every beat of my heart, there's thunder inside 
Every beat of my heart, I need you tonight 
Every beat of my heart, I'm reachin' for you 
I need you now, with every beat of my heart

I hear your voice like a soft tune, echo all around me 
And as I feel the cold wind blowing 
I wonder will you be showing, or forget you ever found me?

Feeling lost, so unhappy
Waiting for luck to appear

Baby please hold me
Make all those bad dreams disappear
She whispers hold me
Baby please hold me

Drift away so secure

And all your happy ever afters

To keep you from the flame

Once too often
When you cry wolf

If you start to crack
And if you're ever feeling humble

Into the fire
'Cause I'm out of sympathy
And I can't walk this wire

So find yourself somebody new
To catch you when you fall
'Cause I got just one thing to say to you
And that's all

When you cry wolf
No, I won't come knockin'

Laura Branigan,"Now there's a wind blowin' leaves alone the empty street
Down by the place on the corner
Where we used to meet
Two people to proud to give
Afraid of what the heart demands
Two of a kind
We made up our minds to live
Without the ties that bind
Each to each
No surrender 
Out of reach
Where not one tender sound was heard
Not a cry or a whisper
No farewell
Nothing spoken
Silence fell while hearts were broken
No one stirred
Was it love?
Did we ever know the meaning of the word?
Now there's a moon rising in the cold and distant skies
And I can feel it shinin' down like a lover's eyes
Don't know where you are tonight
Or how to tell the things we say
From what we mean
Or why we could never cross the distance in between

I betcha I can make a rhyme out of anybody's name.
The first letter of the name,
I treat it like it wasn't there,
But a ""B"" or an ""F""  or an ""M"" will appear;
And then I say ""Bo"" add a ""B"" then I say the name.
Then ""Bo-na-na fanna"" and ""fo""
And then I say the name again with an """"f"" very plain,
Then  ""fee fi"" and a ""mo""
And then I say the name again with an ""M"" this time.
And there isn't any name that I can't rhyme.
 
Arnold! Arnold, Arnold bo-bar-nold, 
Bo-na-na, fanna fo-far-nold, 
Fee fi m-mar-mold. Arnold!
 
But if the first two letters are ever the same,
Crop them both, then say the name.
Like Bob, Bob, drop the ""B's"", Bo-ob.
Or Fred, Fred, drop the ""F's"", Fo-red, 
Or Mary, Mary, drop the ""M's"", Mo-ary.
That's the only rule that is contrary.
 
And then I say ""Bo"" add a ""B"" then I say the name.
Then ""Bo-na-na fanna"" and ""fo""
And then I say the name again with an """"f"" very plain,
Then  ""fee fi"" and a ""mo""

Everywhere I look tonight 
I can see how I cried
Over love, over you
Over love there was nothing I could do
Over love, over you
I believe in magic
It clouds the mind like sweet perfume
It almost made me crazy
I could've died from the pleasures of me and you
Until the magic drifted away
I never thought I'd say
I'm over love, over you
Over love there was nothing I could do
Over love, over you
And so I'm turnin' on the light

Not gonna do what I did before
Not gonna feel like I felt

Deep inside our desert hearts

Now the memories burn in my eyes
As I remember the look of the broken hearted
Never thought I'd be one of their own

But I know we can't hide we can't run
From the shadow she casts on the night

I want to believe everything that I can't see
But the truth always lies somewhere in between us
I can't help what I feel in the night
Thoughts disturbing the sleep of our innocent lives
Will these dreams ever leave us alone

We're standing in the shadow forever
Her shadow's in the way of our love
What should have been forgotten

All alone with you
I'm the only one
But long before we ever were
You belonged to her
And she still isn't gone...

The same place we first met
Trying to talk it out before 'the fall'

You look the other way
I struggle for the words to say
Feels like I'm talking to the wall

I can here them play our song
But somehow it sounds all wrong
In a lost romance, dancing a lonely dance

With a heart that doesn't beat as much
Fingers that have lost their touch
Looking into eyes that just don't see

We dance a little loud at times
I laugh when I feel like crying
Is there anybody here but me

Two silhouettes in the dark
So close, so far apart
Going through the motions of the past

The night is coming to an end
It's getting harder to pretend
But still we try to keep this love alive

With a heart that doesn't beat as much
Fingers that have lost their touch
Looking into eyes that just don't see

We dance a little loud at times
I laugh when I feel like crying
Is there anybody here but me

Never dreamed what we started could end like this
Lovers saying goodbye with a stranger's kiss

With a heart that doesn't beat as much
Fingers that have lost their touch
Looking into eyes that just don't see

We dance a little loud at times
I laugh when I feel like crying
Is there anybody here but me
Is there anybody here but me
Is there anybody here but me

I've been feelin' there's some reason
To hold on through the night
And for the first time since you broke this heart of mine
I find myself believin'
It's really gonna be alright
Now you're askin' me to let you walk back into my life
Something I can't bring myself to do

Cause it's been hard enough gettin' over you
Ya know you kept me holdin' on till the end
Oh it's been hard enough gettin' over you
I don't think that I could say goodbye again

I could trust you, but it's out of my hands
I once believed your promises
Believed in every word you said
I still love you but my heart won't take the chance
That all the pain I've left behind me,
Might be waiting for me up ahead
Just remember it was you who walked right out of my life
No you don't know what I've been through

But it's been hard enough gettin' over you
Ya know you kept me holdin' on till the end
Oh it's been hard enough gettin' over you
I don't think that I could say goodbye again

And this one, I'm not gonna break
I've made it without you, and I'm not about to
Just turn around and make the same mistake

Oh I love my baby and my baby sure loves me
He understands me like no other so naturally
I spoil my baby with love too hot to throw away
I don't think he'll ever find another that 'll love him that way

Oh baby please, every night
The only thing I really need
To keep me satisfied
You really gotta love your girl
You really gotta love your girl, don't let go
Show her how much you care
You really gotta love your girl
You never gonna lose this girl
Say that it's true, she is your world

My baby knows me
He knows what I love and what to do
He takes me to heaven and I know just how to take him too
I know of no desire my baby has that I can't fulfill
For all the times that we've made love
I've never really had my fill

Oh baby please, every night
The only thing I really need To keep me satisfied
You really gotta love your girl
You really gotta love your girl, don't let go
Show her how much you care
You really gotta love your girl
You never gonna lose this girl

We're all a mystery in this world in which we live
And there's no guarantee that we'll get back what we give
We take a chance on love a dream that lasts forever
We're only flesh and blood
Throwing coins in a wishing well

Only time will tell if a love is true
Only time will tell what a heart is gonna do
Only time will tell who's the dreamer, who's the fool
Only time will tell

We tie the ties that bind with a simple act of faith
No matter how we try we're in the hands of fate
We take the gift of life and give it to each other
We promise you and I a promise that we'll try to keep

Only time will tell if a love is true
Only time will tell what a heart is gonna do
Only time will tell who's the dreamer, who's the fool
Only time will tell

We take the gift of life and give it to each other
We promise you and I a promise that we'll try to keep

Only time will tell if a love is true
Only time will tell what a heart is gonna do
Only time will tell who's the dreamer, who's the fool

Laura Bryna,"She wakes up to Sponge Bob and Captain Crunch
And the love of her family fills the room
She plays with her new friends 'til it's time for lunch
But she remembers why she's there each afternoon

The doctor talked about a blood test
She's not sure what that means
And today she met some volunteers
Who asked about her dreams

Would you like to meet with Dolly
Hang out with Micky Mouse?
Maybe ride a roller coaster
Get turned upside down?

Think of one thing in this whole wide world
You wouldn't wanna miss
Take your time, close your eyes
And make a wish

She let out a big shout and gave them a hug
Said would you mind if my Care Bear tag along?
'Cause he's been my best friend and he brings me luck
And to go somewhere without him would be wrong

They handed her a pencil
Said it's okay to make a list
If you can't spell it, you can draw it
It doesn't matter what it is

Would you like to make a movie
Take your picture with a star?
Have a party in a playhouse
In your very own backyard?

Think of one thing in this whole wide world
You wouldn't wanna miss
Take your time, close your eyes
And make a wish

She thought it over for a moment
Said I know what I'd like to do
My only wish is to make
My friends wishes all come true

Would you like to meet with Dolly
Hang out with Mickey Mouse?
Maybe ride a roller coaster
And get turned upside down?

Laura Bryna,"We had a fire so bright, could light up the darkest night
Never was love so right as it was then
But all of that’s over now 'cause your flames burned out somehow
You came here to let me down with just a few words
And turned the light of your life into smoke from a bridge you burned

Have you really thought this through?
If you let go I will too
That all of the love I thought we knew will never return
Oh, it will drift off to nothing, smoke from a bridge you burned

Then someday when it’s too late you’ll realize
It’s more than my memory stinging your eyes
And you’ll run back to tell me the lessons you've learned
But you’ll only find ashes and smoke from a bridge you burned

You know once you close that door it won’t open anymore
So turn around now if you're ever going to turn
‘Cause the moment you leave
You’ll be turning me into smoke from a bridge you burned

Now the haze has lifted I can see
That the whiskey makes you sweeter than you could ever really be

I started slow and steady, I went from Cola to a beer

""Sweets for a sweetheart"", that is what you said to me

And you don't know
That I'm walking right behind you
Walking real slow
I don't want to catch up with you
'Cause once we got started
We'd have to see it through

I see you on the street
You kiss my cheek
My knees go weak
It's clear you've got nothing to lose
But I'm losing sleep

I see you walking up 14th Street
But you don't know
I'm following behind you
Counting my steps as I go
Maybe ten steps or twelve
Divide us in two
Not counting the blocks 
Between me and you

See you on the street
You kiss my cheek
My knees go weak
It's clear you've got nothing to lose
While I'm losing sleep

People said watch out for that situation
It's nothing more than crazy infatuation
Insist it was love, I weighed common sense
I payed with my heart 'til I saw how much I spent

And you don't know
Now I'm so close behind you
Almost in your shadow

Maybe one step or two

Laura Cantrell,"See the sign of the old hotel
We used to stay there
Empty and threadbare
Water running cold

Searched the streets for old friends
Met only strangers
None who remember
None who would take me home

I miss the bees, I miss the honey
I miss them humming by the flowered vine
My time is short now, I feel it coming
I'll see you darling in the morning light

Spent an hour
In the waiting room
Of our old headquarters
None brought my orders

I rode on alone with my portrait
Missing from their hall of honor
No frame to claim me
In silver black and gold

Lost in the afternoon
Missing an hour or two
Turn the crystal set
Never failed me yet

No voice to say goodbye
Tears on my face have dried
I'll be coming through
On that wavelength a heart can tune

I miss the bees, I miss the honey
I miss them humming by the flowered vine
My time is short now, I feel it coming
I'll see you darling in the morning light

Laura Cantrell,"Your mama wasn't one to mess around with
Had a fleet of cars and all those flashy clothes
Taught you the discipline of doing what she told
Kept her fist around the money tightly closed

She had all you kids to think of
One more precious than the rest big brothers running wild
You learned to kick your heels in style
Did you have it worst or have it best

When you grew like a California Rose
The color of your clothes
Blooming even when the earth was cracked and dry
You sang easy and so sweet, dust under your feet
Opened your heart as natural as can be

Mama never suffered any in-laws
Ran them all away eventually had a plan to keep you near
And a soldier boy who took her deal
To city hall you went teenage bride to be

Next came along the baby carriage
Blessed event came unforeseen
No child in mamas eyes, circumstance easy to hide
Where did you put your loyalty

When you cry like a California Rose?
Scarlet Crimson Robes
Fading even as you reached to the sky
You sang heavy and so sweet, your heart it barely beat
From the hurting it would carry from now on

No one would ever say
You'd hesitate to take the blame
I'm still wondering today
Where is your name in that hall of fame?

When you grew like a California Rose
The color of your clothes
Blooming even when the earth was cracked and dry
You sang easy and so sweet, dust under your feet
Opened your heart as natural as can be

Laura Cantrell,"Khaki & corduroy, leather jackets on the boys
Denim with a worn out place on the pocket
Open faces with knowing looks
Your heavy satchel full of books
Smiles tucked away in mamas lockets

Sometimes, I see their faces in the most unlikely places

You play it straight most of the time
But you're looking for the perfect crime
Find your mark and make your move
Nothing harmed and nothing proved

One night spent on that cold tile floor
Then you creep home guilty like before
Learning how to break or bend
Broken now but sure to bend

Sometimes, I see their faces in the most unlikely places

Late hours in the Spanish clubs
With your arms around the one you love
Find the beat slow and sweet
Neon glow and dance floor heat

Walk by that river in the dark midnight
With that water reflecting in your eyes
Wild currents pulling you away
Standing still I have to stay

Sometimes, I see their faces in the most unlikely places

Laura Cantrell,"I went for a walk in my old downtown
To the top of the hill and I turned around
Train yard's not what it used to be
The station's still standing by the factories
Wendell's serving up the meat and three
The tower lights read L & C

Stood by the stone for the president
Saw the bullet holes where the armies met
Walked for a while with the suffragettes
You know mama's still growing those roses yet
Heard the echo of Bryan in the old court case
And I thought as I walked about love and hate

Passed a soldier boy with a gun of bronze
Made a film of his life said he had a cause
Didn't want to kill, didn't want to die
Felt the lightening flash took it as a sign
That God is love and Jesus saves
And our soldier does participate

Alvin came to New York with his fortune made
And he walked for a mile in the ticker tape
The mayor smiled while Alvin prayed
""Sir, I'd like to ride that subway train""
Shimmers on film like a summer day
Silver black and white, watch it fade away

I left this place at a tender age
In the family book you know I turned the page
Never could describe all the energy
Wakes me up at night with the memory
Mama don't you call me I'm good as gone
You know your daughter loves you but she heard this song

Church bells ringing in the old downtowns
Ancient sadness tumbles down
The heavy veil of tragedy
Makes it hard to breathe, hard to see
You can trace these scars along the ground
When you're out for a walk in your old downtown

I went for a walk in my old downtown

Laura Cantrell,"Come all you people my story to hear
What happened to me in June of last year
Oh, its poor Ellen Smith, how was she found?
Shot through the heart, lying dead on the ground

Its true I'm in jail a prisoner now
God is here with me and hears every vow
So I do promise the truth to relate
I'll tell you all that I know of Ellen's sad fate

I saw her on Monday before that sad day
Found her body lying and took it away
That she had been murdered never entered my mind
Till a bullet through the heart they happened to find

Who is so cruel, so heartless, so base
To murder my poor Ellen in such a lonesome place?
I seen her laid out so still and so cold
I heard the wild stories the witnesses told

I choked back the tears as the people all said
""It was you Peter Degraph, shot our Ellen Smith dead""
Ellen lies sleeping with her hand on her breast
The bloodhounds and the sheriff won't give me no rest

They got their Winchesters and hunted me down
I stole away to Mt. Airy town
I laid off a year and I prayed the whole time
The man could be found what committed the crime

I prayed I'd come back and my character save
But the flowers faded round poor Ellen's grave
So I came back to Winston my trial to stand
I'll live or I'll die as the law might command

Ellen lies sleeping in that lonesome churchyard
I stare through the bars, God knows it's hard
I know they will hang me at least if they can
But I swear to you, I'll die as an innocent man

My soul will be free when I stand at the bar
Where God tries his cross, then there like a star
That shines in the night will my innocence shine
And I'll make my appeal to the justice of time

Laura Cantrell,"Wishing I could see you again dear
That the flame of love would burn once more
But I guess that's wishful thinking
And too much to be wishing for

Just thinking how you once kissed me
Wishing that it hadn't meant goodbye
But I guess that's wishful thinking
Now I know why some people cry

I'll just live my life in dreams
And I long for your love
It's you I'm wishing for
And it's you I'm thinking of

My heart echoes the love words you spoken
How I wish I could hear them from you
Won't you answer a heart that is broken
And make my wishful thinking come true

and he only had one wish.
Big Moe wanted to live to a hundred and five.
So, he got him some fish books,
and learned all about fish hooks.
Then sat back and watched all his fishy friends
meet their sad demise.
His ego increased in size.
Turned out he was not so wise
the day he got caught in that old bottom line.

Stanley Crock was a salesman,
and his spiel never failed him.
Stanley pictured himself filthy rich as can be.
So, he hornswoggled housewives,
even bamboozled barflies.
There wasn't a scam or a rip off
that Stanley hadn't tried.
He owned lots of real estate,
but, Stanley found out too late.
His assets got caught in his own bottom line.

So, one day Stan went fishin',
he saw Moe's big tail swishin'.
Then his eyes went ""kaching"", and he saw dollar signs.
Stanley swore he would catch him,
and sell tickets to see him.
In less than a year that man figured he'd
be a millionaire.
He thought he could reel Moe in 
by making a deal with him.
That catfish would go for his best bottom line.
  
Stanley threw Moe an offer.
Moe bit hook, line, and bobber.
Then he found himself stuck, tangled up in a net.

and Stan ran into trouble.
Then he fell right into the drink/lake, what a 
shame he couldn't swim.
So, Moe's gasping on dry land,
third time going down for Stan.

Laura Dreyer,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere","Here, There and Everywhere"
Laura Flores,"Antes de que te vayas
Déjame mirar
Una vez más ese rostro
Que nunca he de olvidar

Me dices sinceramente
Que me has dejado de amar
Descuida yo bien comprendo
Y te sabré perdonar

Cuida de tu vida
En tu camino
Yo siempre pediré
A Dios por ti

Por ese corazón
Que me dio tanto
Pero acabo mi encanto
Y lo perdí

Perdona si te fastidio
Pero es que es mi sentir
Tal vez no tengo ni forma
De lo que quiero decir

Quisiera pedirte un beso
Que borré los del ayer
Ya no, te quito tu tiempo
Te puede ir, ya lo ves

Cuida de tu vida
En tu camino
Yo siempre pediré
A Dios por ti

Por ese corazón
Que me dio tanto
Pero acabo mi encanto

Me castiga
Recordándome tu voz

Mi piel desnuda
Y a la medianoche, pierdo la cordura
Volviéndome loca, gritando te extraño

Quien me abrigará en la noche
De subiendo
Quien platicará de planes y de sueños

Quien me llevará a la iglesia los Domingos
Si no estás conmigo
Si tú ya te has ido

Me quiero morir de amor
Me duele mi corazón
No puedo con el dolor
Muchos menos sin tu voz

Me quiero morir de amor
Quiero que me lleve Dios
Y así siempre serte fiel
Hasta que vuelva a nacer

Ya son tantos los desvelos
Que no puedo
Y mis lágrimas me ahogan tu recuerdo

Que decirte las caricias que no siento
Como me hacen falta
Y ya no las tengo

Empezar de nuevo sola, desde cero
De pensar lo siento que sólo me muero
Yo prefiero la esperanza de encontrarte
Tenerte a los ojos, de nuevo tocarte

Me quiero morir de amor
Me duele mi corazón
No puedo con el dolor
Muchos menos sin tu voz

Me quiero morir de amor
Quiero que me lleve Dios
Y así siempre serte fiel
Hasta que vuelva a nacer

Laura Fygi,"After one whole quart of brandy
Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no Bromo-Seltzer handy, I don't even shake
Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I?
Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I?

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it although the laughs on me
I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long, for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I?

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it like a babe in arms
Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation put me on the blink

I've sinned a lot, I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I?
I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I?

When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best
Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank God, I can be oversexed again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I?

Wise at last, my eyes at last
Are cutting you down to your size at last
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered no more
Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered no more

Couldn't eat, was dyspeptic
Life was so hard to bear
Now my heart's antiseptic since you moved out of there
Romance, finis, your chance, finis
Those ants that invaded my pants, finis
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, no more","Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered"

And I'm reckless it's true, but what else can you do at the
End of a love affair? 

So I talk a little too much, and I laugh a little too much
And my voice is too loud, when I'm out in a crowd
So that people are apt to stare

Do they know, do they care, that it's only that I'm lonely
And low as can be? 
And the smile on my face isn't really a smile at atll!

So I smoke a little too much, and I drink a little too much
And the tunes I request are not always the best

Thought we said goodbye last night

But here you are with the dawn
Wish I could forget you, but you're here to stay
It seems I met you
When my love went away
Now everyday it seems I'm saying to you

Stop haunting me now
Can't shake you no how
Just leave me alone

Laura Fygi,"I've got you under my skin.
I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself: this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear:
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats - how it yells in my ear:
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
And I like you under my skin.",I've Got You Under My Skin
Laura Fygi,"Lately, I have had the strangest feeling
With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging 'round my mind 
Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say no special place to go
But when I ask will you be coming back soon
You don't know, never know 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye 
Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart 
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping
You just say nothing's changed 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye

I had to come and get it straight from you

I see it's true

Then tell me one thing more before I go

Tell me how am supposed to live without you

How am I supposed to live without you
How am I supposed to carry on

Laura Fygi,"Lady, morning's just a moment away, 
And I'm without you once again.
You laughed at me, you said you've never needed me,
I wonder if you need me now.
We played the grams that people play, we made mistakes along the way.
Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me.
Remembering the pain, if I must say, it's deep in my mind and locked away,
But then most of all, I do love you 
Still.
 
Those memories, times I'm sure we'll never forget,
Those feelings we can't put aside.
For what we had, sometimes I try to understand, 
But it's so heavy on my mind.
So many dreams that flew away, so many words we didn't say.
Two people lost in a storm, where did we go, where'd we go?
Lost what we both had found, you know we let each other down.
But then most of all, I do love you
Still.
 
We played the games that people play, 
We made mistakes along the way.
Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me.
Cause I needed you so desperately.
We were too blind to see, but then,
Most of all, I do love you",Still

But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it

I still see her dark eyes glowing
She was twenty one, when I left Galveston

I still see her standing by the water
Standing there looking out to sea

And the edge of the sky is bruised
I'll wonder if the scene is cast
By accident or by design

Every breath and belly laugh will teach us how to die again,
Each calloused hand and fingertip is a kite-string to a morning hour

Where light will fancy you a friend and greet you with a wink and nod
Every breath and belly laugh will teach us how to die alone,
For light will pull her curtains closed and whisper every parting word

We'll be sending up our final flares",Feather Lungs

And hold you like a melody.

Stealing their corn from the grower's field

Oh, I'll be no more

And we've shaken the dust from every boot and spur
We have counted our days in planks and rails
We have kept our spirits in the dancing halls

When a cold corner stage in the back of the room
Holds a house band carrying an orphan tune
I would swing, I would sway, I would pull my hips
To the sad chorus playing on the overheads

Oh, I'll be no more

Still to this day
I can hear the whistle blow
I can smell the sage burn
I may be as old and stubborn as a pine
But I am just as wild as the young

When a ribbon is curved round the blue-shadowed hills
And the hot steel is humming down the Union Line

Hidden in the hems of summer dresses
""It's only skin, warming skin,"" you said
Innocence can bow and kiss your forehead
How the heat can beat beat beat it from your breath
Go on leave the seeds to break and swell

Tell me all your troubles, I'll tell mine
Show me every weapon you've been hiding
""It's only skin, warming skin,"" I'll say
Innocence can swallow every silence
Come come, color all your visions red
Come come, has the darkness lost its sway?

Laura Hull,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful

It was you and me but I gave too much you see
And now it seems you've grown tired
And wanna walk away, but you feel obliged to stay

I don't name cats with 'Rover', I don't take what I can buy
I don't walk a mile for a cigarette at the corner store
I don't fantasize of the happiness in being poor
I d'nuh, I d'nuh, I do not always think less is more

Come-c, come-a down to the town, to the town
To the place where the people say
Tear it, tear it down to the ground, to the ground on the seventh day
Gimme, gimme joy, gimme love
Gimme peace, gimme places without walls

Walla, walla gone 'cause I cannot find a one
Who has done a thing to make him stay
Travel to the city where they're hammering the sound of freedom
Travel to the city where they're ringing out the bell of love
Travel to the city where they're singing out the song of justice
I d'nuh, I d'nuh, I do not always think less is more

I don't seek tribulation, I don't dance fast when it's slow
I weigh the situation, I try to speak what I know
I don't walk a mile for a cigarette at the corner store
I don't fantasize of the happiness in being poor

Well I fell into the water, now I'm free.

My friends don't really get me, think I'm the only one
Well I sold my soul to Jesus and since then I've had no fun
Behind every tree is a cutting machine and a kite fallen from grace
Inside every man is a heart of sand you can see it in his face.
He'll tick tick tick tick tick tick tick away.

He'll tick tick tick tick tick tick tick away.

If the rain come round and it don't come out, then I'll never have to speak again,
I can tick tick tick tick tick tick tick away.

Can tick tick tick tick tick tick tick away.
Another second lost with every fallen grain.

Leaving his lady alone thinkin' ""he don't love me no more""

Since I broke down
Since we broke down

And you'll be reborn big and stronger and less alive

We're all gonna die when the building blows

Laura Marling,"He walked down a busy street
Staring solely at his feet
Clutching pictures of past lovers at his side
Stood at the table where she sat
And removed his hat
In respect of her presence
Presents her with the pictures and says
""These are just ghosts that broke my heart before I met you.
These are just ghosts that broke my heart before I met you""

Opened up his little heart
Unlocked the lock that kept it dark
And read a written warning
Saying I'm still mourning
Over ghosts
Over ghosts
Over ghosts
Over ghosts that broke my heart before I met you

Lover, please do not
Fall to your knees
It's not
Like I believe in
Everlasting love

He went crazy at nineteen
Said he'd lost all his self esteem
And couldn't understand why he was cry, cry, crying, crying.

He would stare at empty chairs
Think of the ghosts that once sat there
The ghosts who broke his heart.
All the ghosts that broke my heart
The ghosts that broke his heart
All the ghosts that broke my heart
The ghosts, the ghosts, the ghosts, the ghosts,
The ghosts, the ghosts
The ghosts that broke my heart before I met you

Lover, please do not
Fall to your knees
It's not
Like I believe in
Everlasting love

He says ""I'm so lost,
Not at all well""
Do as though there is nothing left to be
Turned out I'd been following him and he'd been following me
Do as though after it was over
We were just two lovers crying on each others shoulders
And I said

Lover, please do not
Fall to your knees
It's not
Like I believe in
Everlasting love

Be scared of living

But I won't give up that quick
My life is a candle and a wick
You can't put it out but you can't break it down
In the end, we are waiting to be lit

There's hope in the air
There's hope in the water
But no hope for me, your life serving daughter

Speak minds handed down to you
By the lies handed down by your truth
Your angels that dance at your will
Will mask your scrambling youth

I forgave you your shortcomings
And ignored your childish behavior
Laid a kiss on your head
And before I left said,
""Stay away from fleeting favour""

Oh, pick up your rope, Lord
Sling it to me
If we are to battle, I must not be weak.
And give us your strength, World
and your food and your water
Oh I am your saviour,
Your life serving daughter

There's hope in the air
There's hope in the water
But sadly, not me, your life serving daughter",Hope in the Air

To anyone who'll hear what you say.

In the breaking of the morning you'll be dancing on the soft lawn
You'll be sinking at the anchor that stopped you from taking my gold
You'll be running up the highway singing ""I'm the king the king of you all!""

Laura Marling,"They dance like sirens, hoping the sun would come out again
And I was born in the fog of that day
Can they hear a babe over all the faith,
Or have they forgot what it was that they made

Crawled out of the fog, found a river,
Found a log and floated away
Didn't think I'd be coming back this way
But my feet are resolute;
Found their root and brought me back to its place

And on the hill where I was born,
There is no rose but just a thorn;
They cut it off each year and give it away

But can they hear a babe after all these days,
Or have they forgot what it was that they made

So left to wander blind, I find myself in cautious times,
And they say, Love's labor is never lost; labor on to this very day.
So I walk into the fog, found a babe atop a log and all alone
Took him under, took him on,
Taught him everything about the world I'd come to know

And he blames me for every wrong ever he made
I am blamed for every wrong ever he made
Forgive me I am only a maid
Forgive me I am only a maid

But I can see a babe under all that blame
And I am forgot from the day I am laid",Made by Maid
Laura Marling,"Oh naive little me
Asking what things you have seen
You're vulnerable in your head
You'll scream and you'll wail till you're dead

Creatures fade by night
Following things that aren't right
And they're tired and they need to be lead
They'll scream and they'll wail till they're dead

But give me to a rambling man
Let it always be known that I was who I am

Beaten, battered, and cold
My children will live just to grow old
But if I sit here and weep
I'll be blown over by the slightest of breeze

And the weak need to be lead
And the tender I'll carry to their bed
And its a pale and cold affair
I'll be damned if I'll be found there
By someone you don't want to be

Laura Marling,"Forgive me here,
I cannot stay
He cut out my tongue,
There is nothing to say

Love me? Oh lord, he threw me away,
He laughed at my sins, in his arms I must stay

He wrote, I'm broke
Please send for me
But I'm broken too,
And spoken for
Do not, tempt me

Her skin is white, and I'm light as the sun,
So holy light shines, on the things, you have done

So I asked him,
How he became this man?
How that he learned,
To hold fruit in his hands?

And where is the lamb, that gave you your name?
He had to leave, though I begged him to stay

Left me alone, when I needed the light
Fell to my knees, and I wept for my life

If he had of stayed, you might understand
If he had of stayed, you never would've taken my hand

He wrote,
I'm low
Please send for me
But I'm broken too,
And spoken for
Do not, tempt me

And where is the lamb, that gave you your name?
He had to leave, though I begged him to stay

Begged him to stay, in my cold wooden grip
Begged him to stay, by the light of my ship

Me fighting him,
Fighting light,
Fighting dawn
And the waves came,
And stole him,
And took him toward

He wrote,
I'm broke
Please send for me
But I'm broken too,
And spoken for
Do not, tempt me

Forgive me, here, I cannot stay
Cut out my tongue, there is nothing to say
Love me oh lord, he threw me away

That suits me well",What He Wrote

Calling my Egyptian blood to bear me flowers
Calling Sophia, goddess of power

I'm pulled by the pull on my throat

Hold my head high, just by the tip of my toes
And he lies, he lies so sweet that I choke

Tonight I choose the beast
Tonight he lies with me
Tonight he lies with me
Tonight he lies with me

Didn't know you'd be right back
I didn't hear the night song
Calling for you into the black

Take the night off
And be bad for me

Didn't ask you to save me
Not when you knew me well
Wouldn't ask you even to behave for me

Laura Marling,"Made my steps towards the water
Where Undine last was seen
I was told that if you saw her
It should make you more naive
Made my steps towards the shore
She sang her love at me
Oh Undine so sweet and pure
Make me more naive
Oh Undine, sing your love to me
Oh Undine, knowing I'd love this lovely scene (?)

There were ropes around my wrist
And the tide pulled at her hair
Pulling her away from me
And me away from there
Yes the water tried to take her
Tried to make poor Undine hide
But she fought herself against it
Love in her had not yet died
Oh Undine, sing your love to me
Oh Undine, fight your way, fight your way

You live for the sea
Undine, you live for the sea
You cannot, you cannot

What's going on in there?
What's going on in there?
Let me in

It's cold there in December
So I took my coat and left
Left Undine by the embers
That's all our fire had left
Left Undine by the shore
Where she sang her love at me
Oh Undine so sweet and pure
Knowing I'd love this lovely scene (?)

You live for the sea

Late at night he’ll come to me
And he’ll tell me I’m alone
Don’t you think I don’t already know?
All I see is road
No one takes me home,
Where, where can I go?

Truth about desire they say,
Is a need to breathe for another day.
Truth I heard about regret
It’s the hardest truth I’ve come to yet
It’s the hardest truth I’ve come to yet

All I see is road
No one takes me home,
Where, where can I go?

If I feel like I’m better fought than won

I’m yours and you’re mine
You’re fine
I’m yours and you’re mine.

I sense danger that won't show
Who holds the hand that holds the gun

Sending shivers down my spine
I feel in my fingers
That I’m one with something divine
It’s divine, it's divine

All the waiting’s only made it sweet

Some great thing to which I am a mystery

I only just got through it

Please don’t let me bring you down

I’m a woman now, can you believe?
Only one thing I’m sure of and that’s that you deceive

You know me then,
You know me now
How did I get lost
Looking for God in Santa Cruz?
Where you go to lose your mind
Well I went too far this time
When we were young
When we were young we belonged to someone
And that was easy

I’ve got us lost so I’ve turned us off
In Joshua Tree
You’re my oldest friend
So I know you then and you know me
It was a bit too high for me
I spent a month thinking I was a high desert tree

Woman downstairs just lost her mind
And I don't care how, I surely don't care why
Why I know false hope

A storm hits the city and the lights go out
Before I can prepare
The whole downtown looks dark like no one lives there

Neither of us is gonna sleep tonight

Laura Marling,"If they adorn themselves with crystals
To make them look sharp
Sleep with their hand on a pistol,
They’re afraid of the dark
Well if it wakes you,
Which it has to be known to,
Don’t be alarmed
Darkness can’t do you harm
Fear will hurt you

And outside, if wind is beating
A tree to a bed
Don’t fear that it might be meeting
Some untimely end
They do what they’re supposed to
But they have been known to
Stand strong and tall,
Weather it all
Take what you can

Never give orders,
Just to be obeyed
Never consider yourself or others
Without knowing that you’ll change
It may not surprise you,
But pride has been known to
Rise up a storm
Countless lives lost
At the hands of pride
And I’ll fall

Who’ll weep for them?
Sometimes I do.
I do sometimes
Who weeps for them?
Sometimes I do.
I do sometimes
You can’t see it, it might be behind you
Keep those eyes wide
You can’t see it, it might be behind you
Keep those eyes wide

Don’t be impressed
By strong personalities
Sincere words
Are rarely sickly sweet
But if they fool you,
Which they have been known to
Don’t lose your sight,
Know something’s not right
And look at the stars

Be weary of being
Given a name
If for some reason
You’re not considered the same
Once they name you,
They have been known to
Lock you in
Statistical sin
They’d rather ignore

Who’ll weep for them?
Sometimes I do.
I do sometimes
Who weeps for them?
Sometimes I do.
I do sometimes
You can’t see it, it might be behind you

Turning corners in our lives
We would have taken any buses
Headed for Telluride
We stopped in the desert
In the middle of the night
And looked to the stars on the old roadside
You look at me and said
Look at the moon,
Take it in, it'll be gone soon

I'm taking more risks now,
I'm stepping out of line.
I put up my fists now,
Until I get what's mine.
Should have been you,
Could have been anyone.
You see I never missed my chance to run
I would go anywhere with you
I would go when you ask me to
How will I live without you?
How will I live?

Posted out Central L.A.
Now if you ever come through here
Won't you come take me away?

So much I can’t hardly bare
I have things I must tend to
Will you stay as you are, lying there
Would you stay as you are, lying there

Kissing the rain off my shoulders
Answering questions with stares
Holding my chest like I’m a wild horse
About to run away scared
About to run away scared

Sun kicks the moon off the mountain
That is my cue to leave

So they don’t wake those who sleep
So they don’t wake those who sleep

Tasting the memory of pain I have endured

And this world may burn my books

And I ain't gonna cry all day

And I'll turn my red light on
Let it shine when the sun is gone
And baby, it's the last dance
Soon I will be leaving
Baby, it's the last dance
I'll pack my boots and pearls

Laura Nyro,"My name is Eddie, I am a cat
And I sleep with one eye open
Watching the morning sail
(Morning, morning)

Someone calls Eddie up to their lap and I purred
But I'd sure like to give me my breakfast
Especially a fish tail, turn it into a fish scale

No, I'm not like you people
You wail and you wore
And you whitewashed your day away

(Where you're going?)
On my merry way
(Where you're going?)
On my merry way

Spring flower are fall, up goes the flower
Cried to run the sleep in the scenic
I like my phone now

To melt the arctic beat in my breast next to yours

Do you know the depth of my need and my prayer?
Or is it just my fantasy for a new world?

There's a new world comin' through

Is it just fine for us to live in a world that cannot give?
As for me, I know I'm strong and I belong in a new world

If you want me, you'll find me in a new world

Lose my cares in a cup of plum wine and salads from the sea
We tripped into the calm little room with the sliding paper walls
Mom was wearin' her rose kimono, she was waiting for the fall

Just another night, a day in the life
Just another foreign film in black and white
When you mess with them, you're out of the realm of Zen
When they put on their party hats
The cook cracked, yeah, yeah, yeah

The cook, he told me, ""Children not exactly well behaved""
I said, ""Well, you can't have it all"" and really, who cares
When the magic plum wine is dancing on the paper walls?
Then your lover shows up, puts a sweet hello on your lips
And you're transported to the mist on the mountain
'Til everyone runs in for the kiss

Don't you know it's just another night, a day in the life?
Just another foreign film in black and white
When you mess with them, you're out of the realm of Zen

Did that ever happen to you?

As the wine descended, my citizenship surrendered
And I became a geisha, I moved through the mystery
Dark and content with an uppity feminist bent
Mr. Cook, don't you save my life, don't you save my love
I am quite contented, yes, sir

The elders say, kids are grown and gone someday
So, let's enjoy the adventure
I'm sorry but it's just another night, a day in the life

Waitress, do you remember us?
As you can see, the situation is still a little out of control
But I haven't had a cigarette, it's amazing, in five years
But you know, for five years, I've been very hungry

Never mind perfection, heroes or heroines.
Tonight, let's be lovers again. Tonight, lover, let's be friends or make a sweet dream fade.

Too many tears can dim the light, give or take, wrong or right.
Innovation, make amends, tonight, let's be lovers again.

Laura Nyro,"I was a sweet baby in my
Mother’s arms
We were strollin’ through the 
Park
Picnic
Peace walk
Progress
Just a baby in her arms
My politics are based on her

Triple Goddess Twilight
Slow down
Feel the land

I’ll meet you there

Mother, you died young and left

Your twilight colors

Ah, burgundy
Coral mist
What are the shades of loneliness?

Triple Goddess Twilight
Late sky, violet and pink
All roads lead to Venus
I’ll meet you there
In your dream of progress

My grandfather painted houses
On a ladder in the sky
He was working class
Urbane
Street-wise
Said, “we can change the world, 
Girl,
Love will inspire,”
Told me this through whiskey
And revolutionary fire

Last trace of ruby and flame
First star leads to Venus

He left a war
To walk in peace now

Laura Nyro,"Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow

Laura Nyro,"Each night before you go to bed my baby
Whisper a little prayer for me my baby
And tell all the stars above
This is dedicated to the one I love

(life can never be exactly like we want it to be)
I could be satisfied knowing you love me
(but theres one thing I want you to do especially for me)
And its something that everybody needs

While Im far away from you my baby
Whisper a little prayer for me my baby
Because its hard for me my baby
And the darkest hour is just before dawn

If theres one thing I want you to do
Especially for me
And its something that everybody needs

Each night before you go to bed my baby

Laura Nyro,"We went to a Japanese restaurant
The dogs, the kids, and me
Lose my cares
In a cup of plum wine
And salads from the sea
We tripped into the calm little
Room
With the sliding paper walls
Mom was wearin’ her rose kimono
She was waiting for the fall

Just another night
A day in the life
Just another foreign film
In black and white
When you mess with them
You’re out of the realm of Zen
When they put on their party
Hats
The cook cracked, yeah yeah yeah 

The cook, he told me
“Children not exactly well
Behaved”
I said, “Well, you can’t have it all”
And really, who cares
When the magic plum wine
Is dancing on the paper walls?
Then your lover shows up
Puts a sweet hello on your lips
And you’re transported
To the mist on the mountain
Till everyone runs in for the kiss

Don’t you know
It’s just another night
A day in the life
Just another foreign film
In black and white
When you mess with them
You’re beyond the realm of Zen
When they put on their party 
Hats
The cook cracked, yeah yeah yeah 

Did that ever happen to you?

As the wine descended
My citizenship surrendered
And I became a geisha
I moved through the mystery
Dark and content
With an uppity feminist bent
Mr. Cook, don’t you save my life
Don’t you save my love
I am quite contented, yes, sir
The elders say
Kids are grown and gone
Someday
So let’s enjoy the adventure
I’m sorry
But it’s just another night
A day in the life

Waitress, do you remember us? 
As you can see, the situation is still a little out of control,
But I haven’t had a cigarette—it’s amazing—in five years. 
But you know, for five years, I’ve been very hungry. 

I’m sorry
But it’s just another night and day",Japanese Restaurant Song
Laura Nyro,"Dinner in the kitchen
Delicious to eat
Thou shall not kill, darlin’
Let wild things run free
I heard
The wolf is gone
I heard
So is the whale of the sea
And who are we?
Where are we goin’
To be so willin’
For the killin’
Of the wild world?

Trapped by man’s endangered
Soul
By science, sport, and fashion

Does that fur belong on?

Laura Nyro,"There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
It is a special one, it's never seen the sun
It only comes out when the moon is on the run
And all the stars are gleaming
It's growing in the street right up through the concrete
But soft and sweet and dreaming

There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
With eyes as black as coal that look down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control
I have to beg your pardon

I'm going to pick that rose 
And watch her as she grows in my garden

Laura Pausini,"Partiro quando dorme ancora la città
Nell'aria fresca con la macchina che va
Chissà se ci sarà quest'anno
Quel ragazzo in discoteca al molo
Come pirati che si appostano nei bar
Ragazzi mettono il tuo cuore in trappola
see'è musica che va nel buio
Chiudi gli occhi e cadi dentro a un guaio
Baci che si rubano
E la pioggia su di noi
In questo mare dire
Amore è una bugia
Che vola via innocente
Voci che si giurano
Di non lasciarsi mai
Su quelle spiagge
Giorno e notte più affolate che in città
Il sole con gli occhiali scuri se ne andrà
È il gioco antico degli sguardi inizierà
Le compagnie che fanno tardi
La mattina in spiaggia siamo zombi
Quanti tramonti che non scorderemo mai
Quanti maglioni messi sulle spalle e poi
Quelle carezze sulla sabbia
Sono un faro accesso nella nebbia
Baci che si rubano
E la pioggia su di noi
In questo mare amaro
Amore di un addio
Che fugge via per sempre
Voci che si giurano
Di non lasciarsi mai
Ma già le spiagge sono vuote
E questa estate se ne va
Ora che la vita è stretta
Da questa realtà

Ma perché
Questo cuore non si arrende
E i tuoi jeans
Io mi metterò
Poi prenderò
Quella tua fotografia
La stringerò
Come stringo te
Ma perché
Il mio cuore non si arrende
Domani no
Non mi alzerò

Per tutti quelli come me
Quelli nella vita hanno perduto
Un grande amore dentro se
Quando quel giorno mi hai lasciato
Salendo in macchina con lei
Hai detto addio alla mia allegria
E in questa vita sto toccando il fondo
Dimmi dove sei
Adesso cerco adesso inseguo te
Nei giorni miei
Mi manchi come mai
Sento il telefono suonare
Penso ogni volta che sei tu
Cerco qualcosa da mangiare
Ma proprio niente mi va giù
Quando l'amore ti fa male
Non può resistere di più
Ma come me see'è una tribù
Di gente che alla fine non si arrende

Da domani tutto come sempre tornerà

Non voglio amare più così
Come vorrei odiarti farti anche del male ma
Vorrei soltanto averti qui con me non voglio amare più così
Io senza te che vita è
Ogni sera esco e tu sei li che guardi me
Da quella foto al mare ed io ti chiuderei in una scatola
Mi ha telefonato quella che non molla mai
Ma se l'amassi forse io potrei con lei dimenticare te
Poi delle vacanze quanto se ne parlerà

E aprendi al filo ogni speranza mia
Io non avrei creduto mai di poter perder la testa, per te
All'improvviso sei fuggito via
Lasciando il vuoto in questa vita mia
Senza risposte ai miei perché adesso cosa mi resta di te

Non c'è non c'è il profumo della tua pelle
Non c'è il respiro di te sul viso
Non c'è la tua bocca di fragola
Non c'è il dolce miele dei tuoi capelli
Non c'è che il veleno di te sul cuore
Non c'è via d'uscita per questo amore
Non c'è non c'è vita per me, più
Non c'è non c'è altra ragione che mi liberi l'anima

Incatenata a notte di follia
Anche in prigione me ne andrai per te
Solo una vita non basta per me
E anche l'estate ha le sue nuvole
E tu sei l'uragano contro me
Strappando i sogni nei giorni miei te ne sei andato di fretta perché

Non c'è non c'è il veleno di te sul cuore
Non c'è via d'uscita per questo amore
Non c'è non c'è vita per me, più

Se esiste un Dio no può scordarsi di me anche se
Fra lui e me c'è un cielo nero nero senza fine
Lo pregherò, lo cercherò e lo giuro ti troverò
Dovessi entrare in altre dieci cento mille vite
In questa vita buia senza di te sento che
Ormai per me sei diventato l'unica ragione
Se c'è un confine nell'amore giuro lo passerò
E nell'imenso vuoto di quei giorni senza fine ti amerò
Come la prima volta a casa tua

Il treno delle 7:30 senza lui
È un cuore di metallo senza l'anima
Nel freddo del mattino grigio di città
A scuola il banco è vuoto, Marco è dentro me
È dolce il suo respiro fra i pensieri miei
Distanze enormi sembrano dividerci
Ma il cuore batte forte dentro me
Chissà se tu mi penserai
Se con i tuoi non parli mai
Se ti nascondi come me
Sfuggi gli sguardi e te ne stai
Rinchiuso in camera e non vuoi mangiare
Stringi forte al te il cuscino
Piangi non lo sai quanto altro male ti farà la solitudine
Marco nel mio diario ho una fotografia
Hai gli occhi di bambino un poco timido
La stringo forte al cuore e sento che ci sei
Fra i compiti d'inglese e matematica
Tuo padre e suoi consigli che monotonia
Lui con i suoi lavoro ti ha portato via
Di certo il tuo parere non l'ha chiesto mai
Ha detto un giorno tu mi capirai
Chissà se tu mi penserai
Se con gli amici parlerai
Per non soffrire più per me
Ma non è facile lo sai
A scuola non ne posso più
E i pomeriggi senza te
Studiare è inutile tutte le idee si affollano su te
Non è possibile dividere la vita di noi due

Che non riesci più a buttare via

Si yo tuviera valor
Debiera abandonarle

Qué puede pasar?
Podrías lastimarme tu
Pero puedes resultar herido
Oh no, tú no

Por qué no?
Diré que ha sido culpa mía
Diré que han sido mis manías
Que lo he querido y lo he buscado yo

Por qué no?
Esta noche te diviertes tú
Mañana la venganza es mía
Porque mañana puede ser mi día
Por qué no?

Cuántas dudas, cuántos porqués
Si no es amor que es lo que puede ser
Irresistiblemente suya me, quedo con él
Al menos dime que me adorarás
Dámelo todo, abrázame al final
Y júrame después que no me dejarás

Qué puede pasar?
Podrías lastimarme tu
Pero puedes resultar herido
Oh no, tú no

Por qué no?
Diré que ha sido culpa mía
Diré que han sido mis manías
Que lo he querido y lo he buscado yo

Por qué no?
Esta noche te diviertes tú
Mañana la venganza es mía
Porque mañana puede ser mi día
Por qué no?

",¿Por Que No?
Laura Pausini,"Ya sabí­a que no llegarí­a,
Ya sabí­a que era una mentira,
Cuanto tiempo que por él perdí­,
Que promesa rota sin cumplir
Son amores problemáticos,
Como tú, como yo
Es la espera en un teléfono,
La aventura de lo ilógico,
La locura de lo mágico,
Un veneno sin antí­doto,
La amargura de lo efí­mero,
Porque él se marchó

Amores, tan extraños que te hacen cí­nica,
Te hacen sonreí­r entre lágrimas
Cuántas páginas hipotéticas, para no escribir las
auténticas
Son amores que sólo a nuestra edad
Se confunden en nuestros espí­ritus,
Te interrogan y nunca te dejan ver
Si serán amor o placer

y cuantas noches lloraré por él,
Cuantas veces volveré a leer
Aquellas cartas que yo recibí­a
Cuando mis penas eran alegrí­as
Son amores esporádicos,
Pero en ti quedarán

Amores, tan extraños que vienen y se van,
Que en tu corazón sobrevivirán,
Son historias que siempre contarás
Sin saber si son de verdad

Son amores frágiles,
Prisioneros, cómplices,
Son amores problemáticos,
Como tú, como yo
Son amores frágiles,
Prisioneros, cómplices,
Tan extraños que viven negándose
Escondiéndose de los dos

Son amores que sólo a nuestra edad
se confunden en nuestro espí­ritu,
son amores problemáticos
que se esconderán de los dos
Son amores que vienen y se van,
Son historias que siempre contarás

Esta vez me lo prometeré,
Tengo ganas de un amor sincero, ya sin él",Amores Extraños
Laura Pausini,"Quiero decirte aquello que 
No conseguí­ decir jamás, 
Que he mantenido oculto en mí­, 
Por mucho tiempo ya 
Hay un amor que crece en mí­, 
Que no sé como esconder, 
Ahora te deseo junto a mí­ 

Quiero decirte sólo que 
Tu sigues siendo mi alegrí­a, 
Cuando con ella estás así­, 
Mis celos son una agoní­a 
Por todo aquello que me das, 
Aunque sin quererlo dar 
Esto te lo tengo que contar 

De como cuando tú no estás, 
La soledad se mete en mí­, 
Y me doy cuenta que además 
No me divierto ya sin ti­ 
En cambio si conmigo estás, 
Este oscuro gris será 
De colores con la vida que le das 

Y que difí­cil es 
El hablarte de esto a ti­ 
Que de amor no te gusta hablar, 
Ni conmigo, ni sin mí­ 
Tal vez porque 
Tienes miedo como yo, 
De una respuesta que 
Pudiera abrir tu corazón 

Quiero decirte aquello que 
No logré decir jamás, 
Que he mantenido siempre oculto en mí­ 
Hay un amor que crece en mí­,

Que ocultarán sus corazones
Y están allí con sus pasiones
Con ansiedad y con miedo a equivocarse
Deseando poder decir que sí

Buen amigo y nada más
Ella sin dudar 
Lo comprende todo
Y será un amor 
Como escondido entre los dos
Porque entre gestos y palabras 
Sentiréis que el corazón se para
Sin notar el ruido de la gente alrededor

Laura Pausini,"Cada vez caen por tierra más principios, hay más guerras
Cuántas veces vuestra madre no sabrá de que va
Dos chiquillas que se miran llenas de alegría
Que se prueban la chaqueta de papá
Pero luego que deprisa crecerá su vida
Como un río desbordado y hablarán de amor en una esquina

¿Por qué no volverán?
Esa libertad, y esas carcajadas de los pocos años
¿Por qué no volverán?
No sé donde están, no sé donde están

Dos hermanas que conspiran como dos buenas amigas
Son dos almas que jamás dividirán la realidad
Que una nocha con la luna, que mala fortuna
Se sentían dos sirenas en el viento gritaban su pena

¿Por qué no volverán?
La complicidad, y las confesiones de contarse todo
¿Por qué no volverán?
No sé donde están

El recuerdo no consuela cuando trato de volver a verlas

¿Por qué no volverán?
Las canciones que
En la ducha yo cantaba a voz en grito
¿Por qué no volverán?
La felicidad, no sé donde está

",Por que No Volveran?
Laura Pausini,"Hay días en los que la vida se llena de porqués
La esperanza se preocupa por quererlos resolver
Desconfías de la gente, del amor y piensas que
No es posible que se sufra más que tú

Y esos días tú te rindes al mundo en torno a tí
Para no sentir el miedo del valor que no se ve
Y te sientes tan perdida que ya no puedes más
Sin la fuérza que te da la vida

Busca una salida, un mañana que
Cure las heridas que hay dentro de tí
Lucha por vivir, con ese valor que no se ve

Equivocarse nunca importa, vuélvelo a intentar
Si una puerta se te cierra, otra puerta se abrirá
Lo que en realidad importa es no renunciar jamás
Pues tal vez estés a un solo paso

Busca una salida, un mañana que
Dé una nueva vida a todo el mundo que
Luchará con fe, con ese valor que no se ve

Por todos ellos, échale valor
Por quien lo pierde y lo va buscando
Por los que se sienten tan mal como tú
Por esos que esperan sin desesperar, como tú

Busca una salida, un mañana que
Dé una nueva vida a todo el mundo que
Sólo por dolor no se pierda en el camino

No te rindas nunca, busca en tu interior
Busca la salida, el mañana que
Vuelves a tener dentro del valor que no se ve

",El Valor Que No Se Ve
Laura Pausini,"Pienso que la vida es, un mucho de verdad
Que las cosas no son fáciles, en esta sociedad
Todo tiene un límite que corta toda nuestra libertad
¿Quién nos soltará?

Si todo es tan ilógico, muerdes y se nos va
En este palco escénico llamando humanidad
Qué nos devuelve el ánimo, falto de ilusiones y piedad
Y ¿Quién nos salvará?

Sueños vendados por la realidad
Que quedan dentro sin salir
En esta meta infinita que está
Donde nadie pudo ir, y nunca irá

¿Qué historia es, qué historia es?
Grito de rabia y pregunto por qué
Nunca termina todo el dolor que se ve
¿Qué historia es? Mas la respuesta no sé

Todo es una incógnita, no queda dignidad
El mal es cosa lógica por su normalidad
Es como las promesas que mañana ya ninguno mantendrá
Mas ¿Quien se salvará?

Trenes nocturnos en la oscuridad
Mas dime luego dónde vas
Lunas de plata que alguno quemó
Con ponerlas en el sol yo digo no

¿Qué historia es, qué historia es?
Grito de rabia y pregunto por qué
Nunca termina todo este odio que ves
Conseguiré que con mi voz tu me

Escuches tal vez en los confines
Donde el dolor nunca esté
Donde el dolor nunca esté

¿Qué historia es, qué historia es?
Alguien podrá responder
En los confines, donde el dolor nunca esté

",¿Que Historia Es?
Laura Pausini,"It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

De quién jamás se debe enamorar
Dímelo tú, que llevo aquí una hora
Maldiciéndote, en dónde estás?

No estás por mí, ya lo sé de siempre
Why aunque no estás, mas me apego a ti
Será porque tú eres inocente
La culpable yo, tal vez los dos

Mas cuando estás
El corazón me explota, sí
Si estás aquí tú no me creas dudas
Mis emociones vuelan tras de ti
Por el cielo azul

Ángeles que van amor
Bajo al cielo azul, tratando de abrazar
Esta noche que no puede terminar
Que vuelves a comenzar si lo quieres tú

Aunque ya sé que no me convienes
La oscuridad se ha colado en mí
Te adoraré cada instante, siempre
Mientras logre yo sobrevivir

No sé por qué tengo que decirte
Mi corazón es un girasol
En cambio tú eres un eclipse
Se apagó la luz, enciende el sol

Porque eres tú quien me desconcierta, tú
Que sin palabras eleva mi alma
Quien me emociona, quien me hará subir
Hasta el cielo azul

Ángeles que van, amor
Bajo el cielo azul, tratando de alcanzar
Esa estrella que jamás se apagará
Que volverá a brillar

Dos ángeles tú why yo

Que vuelve a comenzar si lo quieres tú

Usando el tiempo futuro, ya no
Ya no sirve decirnos de nuevo, te quiero amor

Por qué tú sonreír
Cada mañana ya no es para mí
Por qué, no tengo ya nada de ti

Cuando se ama el final se presiente
Se nota un frío, un vacío tan triste
Como en un film se adivina la escena

Cuando se va
Se sabe cuando la historia concluye
Si con excusas mis ojos rehúyes

Por eso dime que me amas
Y ya desde mañana
Nunca más, oh, nunca más

No puede ser
Disimular y negar la evidencia
Como haces tú cuando intentas fingir
Sin tener el valor de decirme qué pasa aquí

Será, dentro de mí
Como una noche de invierno porque
Quizá ya desde hoy no te veré

Cuando se ama el final se presiente
Se nota un frío, un vacío tan triste
Como en un film se adivina la escena
Cuando se va, oh no

Se sabe cuando el dolor te atenaza
Cuando la historia de amor ya se acaba
Por eso dime que me amas
Y ya desde mañana
Nunca más, nunca más, nunca más

Ya ni tengo ganas de engañar
Nada tengo que decirte

A saber que pude ver en ti
Si un momento, yo te quise
Si ya todo se ha pagado in mí

Por que te necesito
Sí, mas cuando, qué se yo
Que difícil es vivir así
Con mil dudas en el corazón

Un día estar sin ti sería bueno
Podría descubrir si yo te quiero
Un día estar sin ti, es lo de menos
Por no dejarlo, hoy

Cabeza why corazón se contradicen
Es una confusión, un laberinto
Querría yo escapar hasta de mí
Oh, no, no me odie, amor

Dame un día

Voy cambiando, mis recuerdos
Se pelean por desearte así
Porque ahora no te siento
Why un desierto se ha metido en mí

why busco un nuevo sueño
Donde el otro se quedó,
Un motivo por el que vivir
Te lo ruego, no me digas que no

Un día estar sin ti sería bueno
Podría descubrir si yo te quiero
Un día estar sin ti, es lo de menos
Por no dejarlo, sabes

Por qué cariño mío, no me haces frente
No sé si es un adiós o un hasta siempre
Es una solución, que tanto como a ti
Me duele

Porque estoy en el límite del mundo junto a ti

No nos tenemos que rendir
Ni ahora cuando una mentira
Nos roba el sueño why la alegría

Soñaré, dos corazones why un latido
Grito a dios que eres mío

Nada nos puede separar
Por esa magia que nos guía
Entre tus días why mi días

Laura Pausini,"Mamá, he soñado que llamabas a mi puerta
Un poco tensa y con la gafas empañadas
Querías verme bien y fue la vez primera
Sentía que sabías como te añoraba

Y me abrazaste mientras te maravillabas
De que aguantara triste y casi sin aliento
Hace ya tanto que no estamos abrazadas
Y en el silencio me dijiste ¡lo siento

Pero ha bastado un ruido para despertarme
Para llorar y para hacer que regresara
A aquellos días que de niña me cuidabas
Donde en verano cielo y playa se juntaban

Mientras con mi muñeca vieja te escuchaba
Los cuentos que tú cada noche me contabas
Y cuando más pequeña tú me acurrucabas
Y adormecida en tu regazo yo soñaba

Pero a los dieciséis sentí como cambiaba
Y como soy realmente ahora me veía
Y me sentí tan sola y tan desesperada
Porque yo no era ya la hija que quería

Y fue el final así de nuestra confianza
De las pequeñas charlas que ayudaban tanto
Yo me escondí tras una gélida impaciencia
Y tú deseaste el hijo que se te ha negado

Y me pasaba el día sin volver a casa
No soportaba tus sermones para nada
Y comencé a volverme yo también celosa
Porque eras casi inalcanzable, tan hermosa

Y abandoné mi sueño a falta de equipaje
Mi corazón al mar tiré en una vasija
Perdí hasta la memoria por falta de coraje
Porque me avergonzaba tanto ser tu hija

No, no, no, no, no

Mas no llamaste tú a mi puerta
Inútilmente tuve un sueño que no puede realizarse
Mi pensamiento está tan lleno del presente
Que mi orgullo no me deja perdonarme

Mas si llamases a mi puerta en otro sueño
No lograría pronunciar una palabra
Me mirarías con tu gesto tan severo
Y yo me sentiría cada vez mas sola

Por eso estoy en esta carta tan confusa
Para contar algo de paz en lo que pienso
No para reclamarte ni pedirte excusas
Es solo para decirte, mama ¡lo siento

Y no es verdad que yo me sienta avergonzada
Son nuestra almas tan igual, tan parecidas
Esperaré pacientemente aquí sentada
Te quiero tanto mama escríbeme tu hija

Pide libertad mas fuerte si
Buscas ese amor que nos falta

En el que tiene hambre why el que se desespera
No te va contando fábulas, tan solo
Tus deseos, explota en tu interior llena el corazón

Por la ventana abierta se lanza lleva o nieve
Va por las sombras de la noche corriendo tras los trenes
Vuela libre entre los árboles como una cometa
Tiene risa why tiene lágrimas que giran en torno a ti

Es La voz que está en ti why en mí
Cada vez que tú la vida ves, que no te abandona porque
Es La voz más sincera, why está en ti why en mí
Con la fuerza que revive en ti, no se queda sola porque se pone a gritar
Con las otras voces que en el mundo están

No habla de la gente, del sol que les castiga
En los campos de cultivo, de olivos why de espigas
Why cuando llega tan fantástica aleja tus temores
Un coro grande, interminable que te canta su libertad

Es la voz que vas detrás de ti
Va detrás de ti, cada vez que tú la quieres ver
Cada vez que tú la quieres ver
Que no te abandona porque es la voz que ha nacido de ti
Ti por ti why por mí, por ti, por mí

Prisionera, nunca más crece en libertad
Dentro why fuera de ti, tan sincera

Con todo el poder de la voz

Ad aspettarti ormai,
Ma dove sei?
Non fai per me, io lo dico sempre
Ma più ci sto, più mi attaco a te
E non so più chi di noi é innocente,
Chi é il colpevole.
Maledetto te!

Ma se ci sei,
Sento il cuore esplodere.
Se tu ci sei, nessun dubbio rimane
E l'emozione è un'onda che va su
Dove il mondo non see'è più

Angeli nel blu, io e te
Sempre un po' più su, irragiungibili
In questa notte che, non sai quanto vorrei
Che non finisse più, angeli nel blu

Non fai per me, ma non cambia niente
Perché non see'è niente uguale a te
E ti vorrei ininterrottamente
In tutti gli attimi dei giorni miei.
Forse perché il cuore è un girasole,
E muore se una stella non ce l'ha,
Ma senza te scivola un'eclissi
Dentro l'anima. Accendimi!

Perché sei tu, che mi butti in mare, tu
Che poi ogni volta mi vieni a salvare
E l'emozione non si ferma più
E un'onda che va su

Sempre un po' più su, irragiungibili
In questa notte che, non sai quanto vorrei Che non finisse mai...

Laura Pausini,"Ehi adesso come stai? 
Tradita da una storia finita 
E di fronte a te l'ennesima salita. 
Un po'ti senti sola, 
Nessuno che ti possa ascoltare, 
Che divida con te i tuoi guai. 
Mai!tu non mollare mai! 
Rimani come sei, 
Insegui il tuo destino, 
Perché tutto il dolore che hai dentro 
Non potrá mai cancellare il tuo cammino,allora scoprirai 
Che la storia di ogni nostro minuto 
Appartiene soltanto a noi. 
Ma se ancora resterai, 
Persa senza una ragione 
In un mare di perché

Dentro te ascolta il tuo cuore 
E nel silenzio troverai le parole. 
Chiudi gli occhi e poi tu lasciati andare, 

E'difficile capire 
Qual é la cosa giusta da fare 
Se ti batte nella testa un'emozione. 
L'orgoglio che ti piglia, 
Le notti in cui il rimorso ti sveglia 
Per la paura di sbagilare. 
Ma se ti ritroverai 
Senza stelle da seguire 
Tu non rinunciare mai

Credi in te! ascolta il tuo cuore! 
Fai quel che dice anche se fa soffrire 
Chiudi gli occhi e poi tu lasciati andare, 
Prova a volare oltre questo dolore.

Non ti ingannerai se ascolti il tuo cuore, 
Apri le braccia quasi fino a toccare 
Ogni mano, ogni speranza, ogni sogno ch vuoi 
Perché poi ti porterá fino al cuore di ognuno di noi.

Ogni volta, che non sai cosa fare, 
Prova a volare dentro il pianeta del cuore. 
Dentro il pianeta del cuore.",Ascolta il Tuo Cuore
Laura Pausini,"Penso che per vivere
Ci vuole verità,
E non è per niente facile
In questa società,
Dove tutto è un limite
Che soffoca la nostra libertà
Ma che senso ha?
Se tutto corre illogico
Morde e se ne va,
In questo palcoscenico
Chiamato umanità,
Che ci travolge l'anima
Senza un'illusione di pietà
Ma chi ci salverà?

Sogni bendati dai lividi e I guai
Intrappolati dentro noi
In questa corsa infinita che ormai
Più nessuno vincerà
Così non va

Che storia è?
Che storia è?
Grido di rabbia e mi credo perché
Non ha mai fine
Tutto il dolore che see'è
Che storia è?
Ma una risposta dov'è?

Non ci sono regole
Nessuna dignità
Il male e un'abitudine
E la normalità
Come le promesse che
Domani più nessuno manterrà
Ma chi si salverà?

Treni di notte nell'oscurità
Ma dimmi poi dove si va
Stelle di carta davanti a un falà
E fermarsi non si può
Io dico no

Che storia è?
Che storia è?
Grido di rabbia e ti chiedo perché
Non ha mai fine
Tutto questo odio che see'è

Come vorrei
Che la mia voce arrivasse da te
Oltre il confine
Dove il dolore non see'è
Dove il dolore non see'è
Che storia?
Che storia è?

Ma una risposta dov'è
Oltre il confine
Dove il dolore non see'è
Oltre il confine
Dove il dolore non see'è.


",Che Storia E
Laura Pausini,"Una lacrima va giù
Dagli occhi nella gola
Se sei tu
Che mi lasci sola
Oh no!
Adesso che vorrei
Sentire il tuo respiro
Su di me
Brivido divino
Che mi dai
Quando sei
Un dolcissimo
Dolore dentro
Dentro me
Fino a che
Siamo al limite del mondo io e te

Perché sai
Due innamorati come noi
Non si arrenderanno mai
Nemmeno quando una bugia
Ci ruba I sogni e l'allegria.
Due innamorati come noi
Indivisibili oramai
Stessi segreti, stessi guai
Per noi.

Stanotte voglio te
A consumarmi il cuore
Ridere
Poi ritrovarsi a far l'amore
Grido a Dio
Che sei mio
E in un attimo tu stai arrivando
Dentro me
Fino a che diventiamo un corpo solo
Io e te

Perché sai
Due innamorati come noi
Non si divideranno mai
Perché see'è sempre una magia
Tra la tua anima e la mia.
Due innamorati come noi
Inconfondibili oramai
Stessi sorrisi, stessi guai
Come uno specchio siamo noi.

Solo noi
Con la voglia di sentirsi adosso
Noi
Sempre noi
Fino all'ultimo respiro che mi dai.

Perché ormai
Due innamorati come noi
Si cercheranno sempre sai
E non impareremmo mai
A stare soli, senza noi

La spiaggia vuota intorno a noi
La sabbia su il capelli tuoi
Niente e nessuno sarà mai
Innamorato come noi


Innamorati come noi
Tu dimmi solo che mi vuoi
Che noi non cambieremo mai
E tutto quello che vorrei

Innamorati come noi
Siamo una cosa sola noi
E se mi guardi troverai
Due innamorati come noi

Innamorati come noi
Indivisibili oramai
Solo noi
Innamorati come noi

Innamorati come noi
Come noi

Innamorati come noi
",Due Innamorati Come Noi
Laura Pausini,"Non scherzare sono triste
Non ho voglia di mentirti ormai
Questa volta non so dirti
Se l'amore che mi dai, é abbastanza per noi

Dammi il tempo di capire
Cosa vedo veramente in te
Se ti ho amato un momento
Se il tuo sole si e già spento in me

Perché di te ho bisogno
Si ma quanto non lo so
E così non riesco a vivere
Se ci penso quanti dubbi ho

Un giorno senza te
Mi farà bene potrei scoprire che
É meglio insieme un giorno senza te
La soluzione per non lasciarsi, ora

Che confusione see'è
Tra testa e cuore, é un labirinto che
Mi fa sbandare, vorrei scappare via
Anche da te, oh no, non odiarmi se puoi

Dammi un giorno

Sto cambiando e I ricordi
Fanno a pugni coi desideri miei
Anche adesso non ti sento
See'è il deserto nei miei giorni ormai

Perché io avevo un sogno
E dov'è andato non lo so
E così non riesco a vivere
Lo ti prego non mi dire di no

Un giorno senza te
Per non restare ancora insieme se
Non see'è più amore un giorno senza te
La soluzione per non morire, ancora

Perché qui amore mio
Non stiamo in piedi e te lo dico io
Se non ci credi, e forse é già un addio
Comunque sia così fa male

Dammi un giorno, senza te
Per non morire no non morire no

Che confusione see'è tra testa e cuore
È un labirinto che fa sbandare
Un giorno senza te
Anche se, mi fa male

Oh no
Solo un giorno
Oh no
",Un Giorno Senza Te
Laura Pausini,"Mamma ho sognato che bussavi alla mia porta
E un po´ smarrita ti toglievi I tuoi occhiali
Ma per vedermi meglio e per la prima volta
Sentivo che sentivi che non siamo uguali

Ed abbracciandomi ti sei meravigliata
Che fossi così triste e non trovassi pace
Da quanto tempo non ti avevo più abbracciata
E in quel silenzio ho detto piano mi dispiace

Però è bastato quel rumore per svegliarmi
Per farmi piangere e per farmi ritornare
Alla mia infanzia a tutti quei perduti giorni
Dove d´estate il cielo diventava mare

Ed io con le mie vecchie bambole ascoltavo
Le fiabe che tu raccontavi a bassa voce
E quando tra le tue braccia io mi addormentavo
Senza sapere ancora di essere felice

Ma a sedici anni io però sono cambiata
E com´ero veramente adesso mi vedevo
E mi senti ad un tratto sola e disperata
Perché non ero più la figlia che volevo

Ed è finita li la nostra confidenza
Quel piccolo parlare che era un grande aiuto
Io mi nascosi in una gelida impazienza
E tu avrai rimpianto il figlio che non hai avuto

Ormai passavo tutto il tempo fuori casa
Non sopportavo le tue prediche per nulla
E incominciai a diventare anche gelosa
Perché eri grande irraggiungibile e più bella

Mi regalai così ad un sogno di passaggio
Buttai il mio cuore in mare dentro una bottiglia
E persi la memoria mancando di coraggio
Perché mi vergognavo di essere tua figlia

Ma tu non bussi alla mia porta e inutilmente
Ho fatto un sogno che non posso realizzare
Perché ho il pensiero troppo pieno del mio niente
Perché l´orgoglio non mi vuole perdonare

Poi se bussassi alla mia porta per davvero
Non riuscirei nemmeno a dirti una parola
Mi parleresti col tuo sguardo un po´ severo
Ed io mi sentirei un´altra volta sola

Perciò ti ho scritto questa lettera confusa
Per ritrovare almeno in me un po´ di pace
E non per chiederti tardivamente scusa
Ma per riuscire a dirti mamma mi dispiace

Non è più vero che di te io mi vergogno
E la mia anima lo sento ti assomiglia
Aspetterò pazientemente un altro sogno
Ti voglio bene mamma scrivimi tua figlia

Due innamorati come noi
",Mi Dispiace
Laura Pausini,"Quante volte ci ho pensato su,
Il mio mondo sta cadendo giù
Dentro un mare pieno di follie,
Ipocrisie.
Quante volte avrei voluto anch'io
Aiutare questo mondo mio,
Per tutti quelli che stanno soffrendo come te.

Il mondo che vorrei
Avrebbe mille cuori,
Per battere di più avrebbe mille amori.
Il mondo che vorrei
Avrebbe mille mani
E mille braccia per I bimbi del domani,
Che coi loro occhi chiedono di più
Salvali anche tu.

Per chi crede nello stesso sole
Non see'è razza non see'è mai colore
Perché il cuore di chi ha un altro Dio
È uguale al mio.

Per chi spera ancora in un sorriso,
Perché il suo domani l'ha deciso
Ed è convicto che il suo domani
È insieme a te.

Il mondo che vorrei
Ci sparerebbe I fiori,
Non sentiremo più
Il suono dei cannoni.
Il mondo che vorrei,
Farebbe più giustizia
Per tutti quelli che
La guerra l'hanno vista,
E coi loro occhi chiedono di più
Salvali anche tu.

Come si fa a rimanere qui,
Immobili così
Indifferenti ormai
A tutti I bimbi che
Non cresceranno mai
Ma che senso ha ascoltare e non cambiare
Regaliamo al mondo quella pace
Che non può aspettare più
Nel mondo che vorrei uh uh uh

Nel mondo che vorrei
Avremo tutti un cuore.
Il mondo che vorrei
Si chiamerebbe amore.
Stringi forte le mie mani
E sentirai il mondo che vorrei
Uh uh uh il mondo che vorrei

",Il Mondo Che Vorrei
Laura Pausini,"Non dire no,
Che ti conosco e lo so cosa pensi
Non dirmi no.
È già da un po'
Che non ti sento parlare d'amore
Usare il tempo al futuro per noi
E non serve ripetere ancora che tu mi vuoi
Perché ora non see'è quel tuo
Sorriso al mattino per me
Perché non mi dai più niente di te
Se ami sai quando tutto finisce
Se ami sai come un brivido triste
Come in un film dalle scene già viste
Che se ne va, oh no!
Sai sempre quando una storia si è chiusa
E non si può più inventare una scusa
Se ami prendi le mie mani
Perché prima di domani
Finirà

E non si può
Chiudere gli occhi e far finta di niente
Come fai tu quando resti con me
E non trovi il coraggio di dirmi che cosa see'è
Sarà dentro di me come una notte
D'inverno perché
Sarà da oggi in poi senza di te

Se ami sai quando tutto finisce
Se ami sai come un brivido triste
Come in un film dalle scene già viste
Che se ne va, oh no!
Sai bene quando inizia il dolore
E arriva la fine più una storia d'amore
Ma se ami prendi le mie mani
Perché prima di domani
Te ne andrai, non sarai
Qui con me

",Seamisai
Laura Pausini,"See'é una voce che
É dentro te
E si libera
Più forte se
Gridi il tuo bisogno d'amore,
Con tutta la voce che see'è.
La senti per le strade
E sopra I marciapiedi,
Negli occhi di chi ha fame,
Di chi non sta più in piedi
E non ti racconta favole
Ma solo desideri
E dice quello che porti dentro te.

Dalle finestre aperte
Si butta nei cortili,
Accende il buio nella notte
Correndo sopra I treni,
Vola libera sugli alberi
Come un aquilone,
Nella gioia e nelle lacrime
Che vedi intorno a te.

È la voce che
Sarà con te
Ogni volta che
La vita see'è
E non ti abbandona perché
È la voce più vera che see'è
Vivrà con te
Con la forza che
Ha dentro se
E non è mai sola perché
Mai sola finchè
È la stessa voce che nel mondo see'è.

E parla della gente
Piegata sotto il sole
Dentro I campi di cottone
È nera di sudore
E quando arriva fino all'anima
Diventa una canzone
Un coro grande e interminabile
Che grida in libertà.

È la voce che
Sarà con te
Ogni volta che
La vita see'è
E non ti abbandona perché
È la voce più vera che see'è
Vivrà con te.

Prigioniera
Non e mai
Cresce libera fuori e dentro di noi,

È più vera Voce nera 
Ogni volta che gridi
Con tutta la voce che see'è

E la voce che
Sarà con te
Ogni volta che
La vita see'è
Grida forte dentro di me
La voce più vera che see'è
Vivrà con te.
Con la forza che ha dentro se
E non è mai sola perché
Mai sola finchè
È la stessa voce
Che nel mondo see'è

",La Voce
Laura Pausini,"Às vezes me pergunto se
Viverei sem ter você
Se saberei te esquecer
Passa um momento e eu já sei
Você é o que eu quero ter
Inesquecível para amar

Mais que uma história pra viver
O tempo parece dizer
Não, não me deixe mais
Nunca me deixe

Quanto mais longe possa estar
é o que eu quero pensar
Não, não me deixe mais
Porque eu te quero aqui
Inesquecível em mim

Ouço a sua voz e a alegria
Dentro de mim faz moradia
Vira tatuagem sob a pele
Te levo sempre em meu olhar
Não canso de te procurar
Entre meus lábios sinto a falta de você

E assim, profundamente meu
Por que pensar que existe adeus
Não, não me deixe mais
Nunca me deixe

Já não preciso nem dizer
O quanto eu me apaixonei
Não, não me deixe mais
Nunca me deixe
E vou dizer porque

Se existe céu
Você sempre será
Inesquecível para amar, oh não
Não, não me deixe mais
Nunca me deixe, uh uh

Não, não
Não, não me deixe
Não, não me deixe
Oh não

Tão grande em mim
Sempre vai ser
Essa vontade de te ter
Não, não me deixe mais
Nunca me deixe

Não, não me
Deixe mais

Quanto mais longe
Possa estar
é tudo o que eu quero pensar
Não, não me deixe mais
Nunca me deixe

Se eu não tiver você

Agora e sempre vai estar
Preso em meus olhos
Inesquecível em mim

Sueñas, me sueñas

",¿Tu con Que Suenas?
Laura Pausini,"Ana, no sé si quieres oirme
Mas no te dejaré
Y si nadie consiguió poder comprenderte
Si que te entiendo yo

Si dudas tu poder vivir
Recogeré tu incertidumbre
Te enseñaré a sonreir
Tus lagrimas se iran

Ana, yo estaré hasta cuando tu
La fuerza no tendras de vivir sin una luz
Ana, yo lo sé, que es duro para ti
Buscar un dia mas, por eso estoy aqui
Ana, dime ¡si!

Y volaré como esas gaviotas
Y me sumergiré en el mar de tus porqué
De tus ojos lejanos, no te abandonaré mas
Si dudas tu poder vencer yo te daré mi confianza
Si comes vives, créeme y no me digas ¡no!

Oh, Ana, yo estaré
Hasta cuando tu
La la fuerza no tendras
De vivir sin una luz
Para vivir sin una luz

Ana, yo no se si te hago bien asi
Mas no me rendiré, por eso dime ¡si! oh
Ana, yo estaré créeme y veras
Créeme y veras lucha en tu interior

Y prueba a amarte un poco mas
Y prueba a marte un poco mas
Ana, dime ¡si!

Si quieres tu lo haras
Siempre puedes encontrar un sitio para ti
Ana, dime ¡si! ah,  Ana, dime ¡si!

Laura Pausini,"Mi perderò
Fa uno strano effetto dire che lo so
Mentre qui sul letto sbriciolo popcorn

Camminerò, nel deserto che si è
Aperto intorno a me
Nell'impronta di un perduto paradiso
Con nessuno mai diviso mai
Soli non si vive mai

Io come un ladro che
Non distingue il bene
E il male dentro sè
E nemmeno sa chi è
Né cosa è stato

Ah, come una danza ormai
La vita avanza e poi
Si prende un pò di noi
E va come un oceano che

Lascia davanti a me tutti gli errori
Miei perchè da soli sai
Qui non si vive mai!
Soli non si vive mai

Mi salverò, perchè questa vita cambia e cambierò
Per un bacio che ho cercato fino a ieri, fino a qui
Puoi morire e poi rinascere così
Quanta carezza c'è nella malinconia

La mia, il dolore prima o poi se ne va via
Come un vortice che mi trascina
E mi riporta su
Ancora viva

Ah, come una danza ormai
La vita avanza e poi
Rinasce insieme a noi
E va come un oceano che

Transporta via
Con sè
Tutti gli errori miei
Senza rimpianti ormai

Ah, come una danza ormai
La vita avanza in noi
E non ci lascia mai
E va cerca speranza ormai

Come una danza e poi
Torna negli occhi miei
Perché da soli sai
Qui non si piange mai

Come una danza
La vita cambia e cambierò
Come una danza la vivró
Con la speranza che ora ho
Come una danza la vita avanza

Laura Pausini,"Sabes que te necesito 
Es una emergencia de amor 
Un sentimiento tan infinito 
Que parece un inmenso dolor 

No me preguntes que pasa 
Es una emergencia de amor 
Un canto libre que me traspasa

Mi pan, mi vino 
Una exigencia del destino 
Una tormenta que atraviesa mi piel 
Dulcemente me parte el alma 

Yo te llevaré siempre en mi bolsillo donde esté 
Como una moneda, un amuleto

Es mi emergencia de amor 
Sentirte cerca para nunca olvidarte 
Conservar de tu boca el sabor 

La noche, el dí­a 
En la tristeza, en la alegrí­a 
Una batalla que no da tregua a mi ser 
Dulcemente me parte el alma 

Yo te llevaré siempre en mi bolsillo donde esté

Que yo entre mis manos guardaré 

Soy tu prisionera 
Tú la evasión que crece en mí­ 
Mi razón primera 
Solamente junto a tí­ conoceré 
El amor que te daré 
Yo te llevaré siempre en mi bolsillo donde esté

Me miras sin pensar en mí
Es sólo una costumbre, ya lo sé

Tú seas como debes ser
Algo más grande, como ayer

Algo sincero, algo más mío
Sentir de nuevo tus escalofríos
Menos distante de mí
Un poco amante, un poco amante

Ya tu sonrisa no es mía
Monotonía, nos falta la energía
Cada vez más desconociéndonos
Inmóviles vamos perdiéndonos

En esta historia
Que confio puede volver
Una historia seria lo sé

Te lo confieso, quiero que
Té seas como debes ser

Algo sincero, algo más mío
Sentir de nuevo tus escalafríos
Menos distante de mí
Un poco amante, un poco amante

Algo más, ah, ah, ah
Un poco amante

Someone to lean on my shoulder

But these things they don't come easy

Some things don't work the way you planned
Sometimes you just can't tell

So I'm looking for an angel
Someone to let you know my love for you
Seems I've never felt this way before
I never wanted to see just what love can do

But these things they don't come easy
I've learned my lesson well
When things don't work the way you planned
You need someone to tell

You are my paradise
The source of my desires
I believe in you so much
I'm longing for your touch
I need you by my side
So all my dreams will fly
I can't live this way because I know
I cry alone

I fear to cry alone alone
So what will I do without you
Who will I see when I close my eyes
I can't face another night alone without you here
Cause I can't face the night
Without you here
Alone without you here
Sometimes you just can't tell

You are my paradise
The source of my desires I believe in you so much
I'm waiting here for your touch
I need you by my side so with my dreams I can touch the sky

I cry alone

Laura Pausini,"Me siento tan bien, así cuándo tú
Rozas mi boca ducelmente, solo tú
Why me dices que no es amor, que es más aún
En este universo que no para de mentir

Cruza una nube que pinta el cielo de gris
Confío tan solo en ti, porque contigo soy feliz
Why sé que caminarás en mis silencios tú
Why que me llenarás com tus alas de luz

Me fido de ti aunque yo nunca te
Lo dije aún, no lo sabes tú
Me siento tan bien, aí, cuánto tú
Tocas mi corazón, mi mente, solo tú
Cuando dices te quiero tanto

Más, más que no puede saberse cuánto
Más, más me siento tan bien, así, cuando tú rozaz
Mi boca ducelmente, sí, sólo tù

why me dices que no es amor, que es más, más aún
En este tiempo que no sabe consolar
Cuanta es la fuerza que com la tuya me das
Me fido de ti why de las promesas que me harás

No sé como sucedió, mas tuvo que ocurrir
Hasta me iría yo al inferno por ti
Qué pena porque ti quiero tanto why no
Lo sabes tú, no lo sabes tú

Me siento tan bien, así, cuando tú
Tocas mi corazón, mi mente, solo tú
Cuando dices no hay que enfadarse

Más, más cuando ríes sin preocuparte
Más, más me diento tan bien, así, cuando tú, gridas
Mi nombre entre la gente con inquietud
Why me dices que vamos juntos
Que mis venas corres tú me siento tan bien

Siempre así así, cuando tú
Siempre así tocas, mi corazón mi mente
Oh, yeah, sólo tú cuando dices te quiero tanto

Más, más me siento tan bien, aí, cuando tú
Tocas mi corazón, mi mente con plenitud
Cuando dices que no es amor, que es más, mas aún

Laura Pausini,"El destino no existia para mí
Hasta que me lo has cambiato tú
En mi barco navegaba en liberdad
Con la vela de mi alma y nada más
En mis dias no encontraba lógica
Cada noche era una duda más
Me sentía como flor de plástico
Olvidaba en un rincón inhóspito
Y yo bailaba en equilibrio hasta saber
Lo frágil que al caer se puede ser
Frente al espejo cuántas veced pregunté
Si llegará el amor a mí también
Ahora sé que mi respuesta eres tú
Porque vivo de ti
Ahora sé que ya mi respuesta encontré
Amor, si... tú.

He querido sin lograrme decidir
Corazón de nómada
Cada fuego era una llama efímera
Y mi huella una señai milésima
He vivido en el seno de la apatia
Y mi tiempo guardo en un baú
Mi trinchera fué mi triste soledad
He rogado que llegaras tú.

Imaginándome otra vida junto a tí
De dias fáciles
De hermosos días fáciles
Más fáciles y cuántas veces al espejo pregunté
En donde está el amor que yo soñe

Ahora sé que mi respuesta eres tú
Porque vivo de tí
No seré nunca la misma porque
Tendré tu amor para mí.

Tu amor para mí
Me llegó, con esto me basta, saber
Que yo no dudo de ti.

Como un círulo que el agua abriendo va
Como el alba que comienza a despertar
Que vuelve a despertar
La tierra de mi mundo tengo en ti
Las cosas tienen ya sentido ay
Y yo no regresarán jamás

Ahora sé que mi respuesta eres tú
Porque tú vives en mí
Ahora sé que no hay más respuesta, que no
Porque yo vivo de ti, vivo de tí.",Mi Respuesta

En la cama una señal de tu amor
Un deseo que a veces no sé contener
Una llama que se vuelve a encender

Quédate esta noche, quédate
Como aquella primera
ámame la noche entera
Hasta cuando el sol empiece a nacer

Horas y horas me adoras, ahora lo sé

Llévame contigo y sabré donde está
El encanto que en los otros no habrá
Tu alfabeto secreto que yo descubrí
El reclamo más prohibido de tí

Quédate esta noche, quédate
Hasta ver la mañana
ámame esta noche entera
Que mi mente se emborrache de tí

Embrújame y por las manos átame a tí
Y pídeme que te ame hasta que el sol
El sol vuelva a ver

Quédate esta noche, quédate
Como aquella primera
Búscame la noche entera
Que la piel se me emborrache de tí

Por horas me adoras, lo sé, lo sé
Horas y horas me adoras, ahora lo sé
Me adoras, lo sé, sí
Hasta ver la mañana

ámame más fuerte ahora
Hasta cuando el sol empiece a nacer

Será mejor, porque
Más que en él pienso en ti
Que yo me pare aquí, que no le diga sí
Que al final sufriré

Mas él-que enormes ojos
Sus miradas son más
Why más que tus silencios
No me atrevo a decirle no

Sucede a veces al corazón
Sin más palabras, sin razón
Si no lo haces se va el amor
Sucede a veces

Sometimes
Why me pregunto si
Me harás como yo a ti
O si aún mucho más
Desde hare tiempo ya

Tú nunca te me das
¿Sabes qué? Me daré
Mas tú, tú no me buscas
Why no preguntas por qué por qué
Mis ojos lloran

Así no puedo decirle no
Sucede a veces al corazón
Que se traiciona, sin razón
Why no se puede volver atrás
Sucede a veces

¿Equivocarse? Sabes que me
Hiciste daño why a ti también
Si no lo hacemos morirá el

Cómo se hará, que desafío

Que fin extraño este será
No digas cómo se hará, Cómo se hará
Que desafío

Debo decirte que te amo
Porque es mi única verdad
Tu no me sueltes de la mano
Aunque podamos terminar

Desde el blanco de la pagina
Desde mi fragilidad
Desde mi carta te cuento de mi sinceridad

Quiero decirte que te amo
Quiero decirte que eres mio
Que no te cambio por ninguno 
Que por tenerte desvarío

Quiero decirte que te amo
Quiero decirte estoy aquí
Aunque me aleje de tu lado 
Tras la ventana de un taxi
Yquiero decirte que que no te cambio por ninguno
Porque eres todo, yo porque

Quiero decirte que te amo

Laura Pausini,"Hare frío ya, en esta playa que
Es la página arrancada a nuestro ayer
Qué invierno hará si ya el amor se fue
No viviré

Ya ni el alma está, ha muerto la alegría
Queda un mar que se va, why barre nuestra vida
La tuya, la mía, perdida eternidad
¡Que ya no es más que arena a ráfagas

Recuérdame, milán todo nevado
Why un tibio sol mirándonos correr
Recuérdame, si no se te hare raro
Revive así el gran instante aquél

why regreso náufraga, why en la habitación no estás
Me dormiré, sola sin ti, soñandóte al soñar
Why la vida va tenaz como yo soy

No tendrá piedad, si no me quieres hoy
Mas tú qué harás con esta libertad
Que para mí no tiene utilidad

Recuérdame, milán todo nevado
Los besos que te dí al amanecer.
Recuérdame, no sientes que te llamo
No pidas que te deje de querer

why despierto náufraga
Why en la habitación no estás
Why escapo así, dejando aquí
Este alba espléndida

Recuérdame, recuerda que te extraño
Recuerda a quien jamás te va a perder
",Recuerdame
Laura Pausini,"Ya no estamos solos nunca aquí 
Para hablarnos de tí, de mí 
Un mes que no me abrazas y yo aún 
Quiero justificarlo y tu? 
Por qué por qué por qué arruinarlo todo
Por qué 
Por ti sólo por ti respiraré hasta el fondo 
Amor yo no me rindo 

Si no me quieres hoy 
Nunca me perderás 
Sé perdonarte las cosas que no me das 
Segura estoy si no me quieres hoy 

Qué pudo ser, que te alejo, no sé 
Y el amor vida mía se fue 
Tus celos tus mentiras tu actitud 
Todo eso eres tú, si tú 
Por qué por qué por qué borrarlo 
Todo por qué 
Por ti sólo por ti amor yo no me rindo

Nos tachan de rebeldes,
Fotografas e imgenes de un infinito film.
Somos culpables de ser inocentes,
Tozudos e inconscientes.
Rfagas de tempestad,
Why banderas de felicidad,
Soldados de un amor que le dispara as a la guerra.
Somos hoy las pginas,
Donde escribir las fbulas,
La sal entre las lgrimas,
Los besos que en el cine das,
Lo opuesto a un hroe solo soy, (solo soy)
Somos hoy.
Somos mensajes dentro de botellas,
Viajando a las estrellas,
La historia que podr llenar,
Los libros de la verdad.
Somos las almas que entre s conversan,
Bajo una piel diversa,
Somos todos nufragos
Por las calles de alguna ciudad,
Soldados de un amor que le dispara as a la guerra
Somos hoy las pginas,
Las noche ms fantsticas,
Las notas de la msica,
El sol que siempre volver,
Lo opuesto a un hroe solo soy, (solo soy)
Somos hoy.
La frontera
De un sueo que tuvimos
En otra primavera,
Que todo el odio why la nieve fundir
Why el mar del alma recoger.

La vida que no acabar
Lo opuesto a un hroe solo soy, (solo soy)

Laura Pausini,"Try looking at tomorrow not yesterday 
And all the things you left behind 
All those tender words you did not say 
The gentle touch you couldn't find 

In these days of nameless faces 
There is no one truth but only pieces 
My life is all i have to give 

Dare to live until the very last 
Dare to live forget about the past 
Dare to live giving something of yourself to others 
Even when it seems there's nothing more left to give 

Ma se tu vedessi l'uomo 
Davanti al tuo portone 
Che dorme avvolto in un cartone
Se tu ascoltassi il mondo una mattina 
Senza il rumore della pioggia
Tu che puoi creare con la tua voce
Tu, pensi i pensieri della gente
Poi, di Dio c'e solo Dio

Vivere, nessuno mai ce l'ha insegnato
Vivere, non si può vivere senza passato
Vivere è bello anche se non l'hai chiesto mai
Una canzone ci sarà, qualcuno che la canterà 

Dare to live searching for the ones you love 
(Perché, perché, perché, perché non vivi questa sera?) 
Dare to live no one but we all 
(Perché, perché, perché, perché non vivi ora?) 
Dare to live until the very last 
(Perché, perché, perché la vita non è vita) 
Your life is all you have to give (Perché) 
non l'hai vissuta

Dare to live until the very last

Anche se non mi vuoi
Tu non mi perderai
So perdonarti le cose che non mi dai

E la tua gelosia dov'è?
Le tue bugie non le sopporto più

E unombra sullasfalto
Come ulisse ho dentro la mia bussola
E un viaggio a cuore aperto

Sembra un sole questa grande luna
Il suo raggio e il mio portafortuna
Trovero da sola le mie rotte
Faccio vela mentre la notte va

E unaquila nel cielo e va
Che vola sul presente e va
E scioglie tutto il gelo e va
Sognando immensamente

Lanima che balla libera il pensiero
Seguira una stella che dal buio nascera
E sara una danza magica davvero
Mi dara speranza mentre avanza

Questa notte va
Quanto e grande il cielo dellamerica
E un mare capovolto
Avrai letto certo la mia lettera

E stato un grande salto
Via da tutto per unavventura
Del futuro io non ho paura

E non sono in cerca di vendette
Ti perdono mentre la notte va
E come un uragano e va
Trascina la mia mente e va

Sognando immensamente
Lanima che balla libera il pensiero
Seguira una stella che dal buio nascera
E sara una danza magica davvero

Mi dara speranza mentre questa notte va
E unaquila nel cielo e va
Che vola sul presente e va
E scioglie tutto il gelo e va
Mentre la notte va

Laura Pausini,"Lo sai
Tu mi hai messo nei guai
I miei occhi sono isole
Dove non viaggi mai
Bravo forse più di me
A ingannarmi senza maschera
Ed io a fidarmi di te
È durato un flash
Io mi ero illusa di noi
Ma con l'istinto di una donna
Oggi so chi sei

Un gioco che non vinco mai
Il mio sbaglio più grande
Che rabbia che mi fai
La trappola dei giorni miei, sei
Il mio sbaglio più grande
Ma che rifarei

Dimmi
Dimmi come stai
Sembri un angelo depresso
Che non vola mai
Giuro (giuro) che ti sposerei (sposerei)
Ma c'è nascosto un diavolo
Nelle lacrime che mi dai (che adesso mi dai)

È durato un flash
Io mi ero illusa di noi
Ma non è giusto farne un dramma
Tanto so chi sei

Un gioco che non vinco mai
Il mio sbaglio più grande
Che rabbia che mi fai
Il vuoto sotto i passi miei, sei
Il mio sbaglio più grande
Ma che rifarei

Mi contraddico coi miei baci
Ma è così
Spegni tutte le luci e
Va da se che sono persa di te

Un gioco che non vinco mai
Il mio sbaglio più grande

Un gioco che non vinco mai (non vedi)
Il mio sbaglio più grande
Che rabbia che mi fai
Il vuoto sotto i passi miei sei
Il mio sbaglio più grande
Ma che rifarei

(Un gioco che non vinco mai) sei un gioco che non vinco mai, non vedi
(Il mio sbaglio più grande, che rabbia che mi fai) sei lo sbaglio mio più grande sai

Ma che rifarei",Il Mio Sbaglio Pui Grande
Laura Pausini,"Questa strada è la mia casa che non ho
Il soffitto è un grande cielo splendido
Se potessi volerei da un angelo
Per giocare insieme a lui sopra la luna

Questa strada di baracche sbattute la
Dove abita la nostra povertà
È la scuola dei bambini como me
Che hanno per maestre fame e lacrime

Vivere sembra impossibile qui
Come accendere nel mare un falò
È un mondo senza regole
È un brutto film che un giorno scorderò

Questa strada di tristezza e polvere
Senza mamme di carezze e favole
Ma è qui che vedo il Dio della città
Ed è lui che mi dara' la libertà

Vivere è un gioco a perdere qui
È scappare la prigione dei ""No""
È respirare colla per essere
Ladri di attimi 'credere
Che ci riesci a vivere

Dentro me cerchero' quella fede che non ho
Dall'amore anch'io così rinascerò

Vivere com'è difficile qui
Quando gridi al cielo ""Kyrie eleison""
Ma se vincere un miracolo non si può
So che io non mi arrenderò
Di volermi libero

Vivere forse è possibile qui
Ce l'avrai pietà di noi ""Kyrie eleison""
Signore la mia strada io troverò
Con te camminerò
Per vivere per vivere
",Per Vivere
Laura Pausini,"Quanto freddo fa su questa spiaggia che
è una pagina strappata senza te

E´ inverno già e amore non ce n´é
Da vivere

Non c´è un´anima
Si è spenta l´allegria
Resta un mare che va
E ha già spazzato via

La tua, la mia
Perduta eternità
Che ormai non è che
Sabbia a raffiche

Ricordami
Nel freddo di milano
Nei sandali di corse libere

Ricordami
Se non ti sembra strano
Rivivere quegli attimi
Con me

E ritorno naufraga
Nella stessa camera
E dormo qui
Senza di te
Come una stupida

E la vita va
Testarda più di noi
E non ha pietà
Se adesso non mi vuoi

Ma tu, che fai
Di questa libertà
Che ormai per me
è un vuoto inutile

Ricordami
Nel freddo di milano
Fra i mandorli di un paradiso blu

Ricordami
Non senti che ti chiamo
Non chiedermi
Di non amarti più

E mi sveglio naufraga
Nella stessa camera
E scappo via
Lasciando qui quest´alba splendida

Ricordami

Ricordami
Ricorda da lontano
Ricorda chi
Non vuole perderti

Mentre il tempo corre via
Flash di una fotografia
Ho un regalo se mi vuoi
La vita che verrà
Per noi

",Ricorda Mi
Laura Pausini,"Siamo la vita scritta sopra i muri
Confusi ed insicuri
Fotografie e immagini di un infinito film
Siamo colpevoli esseri innocenti

Testardi ed incoscienti
Raffiche di grandine
E bandiere di felicita´
Soldati di un amore
Che ha sparato sulla Guerra

Siamo noi le nuvole
Le frasi nelle lettere
Il sale delle lacrime
I baci dentro ai cinema

L´esatto opposto degli eroi siamo noi
Siamo messaggi dentro le bottiglie
Che forse un dio raccoglie
La storia da riscrivere

Sui libri della realta´
Noi che veniamo
Da lontane stelle
Diversi nella pelle

Siamo tutti naufraghi
Per le strade di mille citta´
Soldati di un amore
Che ha sparato sulla Guerra

Siamo noi le nuvole
Gli esami da ripetere
I campi delle fragole
L´estate che ritornera´

L´esatto opposto degli eroi
Siamo noi, la frontiera
Di un sogno fatto insieme
Di un´altra primavera

Che tutto l´odio e la neve sciogliera´
Nel mare immenso dell´anima
Siamo noi le nuvole
Le frasi nelle lettere

I campi delle fragole
La vita che non finira´
L´esatto opposto degli eroi
Siamo noi siamo noi

Ti attraversa il cuore,
Lascia un'emozione,
Che non se ne va.

Non so dirti come,
Ma succede solo
Quando due persone
Fanno insieme un volo.
Che ci porta in alto,
Oltre l'altra gente,
Come fare un salto
Nell'immensità
E non see''e distanza,
Non see'è mai

Non ce n'è abbastanza, se
Se tu sei già dentro di me,
Per sempre

In qualunque posto sarai,
In qualunque posto sarò,
Tra le cose che vivi
Io per sempre vivrò.
In qualunque posto sarai,
Ci ritroveremo vicino,
Stretti l'uno nell'altro,
Oltre il destino

Su qualunque strada,
In qualunque cielo,
E comunque vada
Noi non ci perderemo.
Apri le tue braccia,
Mandami un segnale,
Non aver paura, che ti troverò
Non sarai mai solo
ci sarò

Continuando in volo che,
Che mi riporta dentro te
Per sempre

In qualunque posto sarai,
In qualunque posto sarò,
Tra le cose che vivi
Io per sempre vivrò.
In qualunque posto sarai,
Non esisteranno confini
Solamente due amici
Più vicini

Credi in me,
Non avere dubbi mai,
Tutte le cose che vivi
Se sono vere come noi,
Lo so, tu lo sai
Che non finiranno mai

In qualunque posto sarai,
In qualunque posto sarò,
Tra le cose che vivi
Io per sempre vivrò.

In qualunque posto sarai,
In qualunque posto sarò,
Se mi cerchi nel cuore,
Nel tuo cuore vivrò

Tu dimmi se see'è ancora per me 
Un'altra occasione,  un'altra emozione 
Se ancora sei tu 
Ancora di più un'altra canzone fresca e nuova 
Tu dimmi se ormai qualcosa di noi see'è ancora Dentro agli occhi tuoi 
Oh no... gli occhi tuoi 

E ritorno da te perchè ancora ti voglio 
E ritorno da te contro il vento che see'è 
Io ritorno perchè ho bisogno di te 
Di respirare fuori da questa inquietudine 
E ritrovare mani forti su di me 
E non sentirmi sempre così fragile 

Tu dimmi solo se see'è ancora per me 
Un'altra occasione, un'altra emozione 
Dimmi se ancora sei tu 
Ancora di più la nostra canzone che risuona 
Tu dimmi se ormai qualcosa di noi see'è ancora Dentro gli occhi tuoi, oh no.. 

Se ancora sei tu 
Una canzone fresca e nuova 
Tu dimmi se ormai qualcosa di noi see'è ancora Dentro agli occhi tuoi, 
Oh no... gli occhi tuoi 
Dimmi solo se see'è e ritorno da te",E Ritorno da Te
Laura Pausini,"Una vez mas casi continuamente
Vuelve a caer, y volverá a equivocarse
Mucho más fuerte si cabe

La vida es un hilo en equilibrio
Que al separar dos puntos equidistantes
Puede acercarles

Y cada día juntos
Haciendo sólo un metro más
Se necesita todo
Todo lo bueno y lo malo que tengas en ti

Aunque después te baste una sonrisa
Para fundir todo un invierno de hielo
Para empezar desde cero

Porque no hay un límite para nadie
Que dentro de él tenga valores eternos
No hay más misterio

No somos ángeles, no nos caímos del cielo
La gente que busca el amor verdadero
Gente que quiere un mundo sincero
La gente corriente de cualquier ciudad

Prueba y veras que siempre hay algo nuevo
Dentro de ti para empezar otro vuelo
Directo al cielo

No somos ángeles, no nos caímos del cielo
La gente que busca el amor verdadero
Gente que quiere un mundo sincero
La gente que unida lo cambiara

Gente que quiere un mundo sincero
La gente que unida lo cambiara

Unida lo cambiara, lo veras
Gente que luchara
Unida lo intentara, lo veras
Gente que arriesgara
Unida lo lograra, lo veras
Gente que cambiara

Laura Pausini,"Lo sai
Tu mi hai messo nei guai
I miei occhi sono isole
Dove non viaggi mai
Bravo forse più di me
A ingannarmi senza maschera
Ed io a fidarmi di te
È durato un flash
Io mi ero illusa di noi
Ma con l'istinto di una donna
Oggi so chi sei

Un gioco che non vinco mai
Il mio sbaglio più grande
Che rabbia che mi fai
La trappola dei giorni miei, sei
Il mio sbaglio più grande
Ma che rifarei

Dimmi
Dimmi come stai
Sembri un angelo depresso
Che non vola mai
Giuro (giuro) che ti sposerei (sposerei)
Ma c'è nascosto un diavolo
Nelle lacrime che mi dai (che adesso mi dai)

È durato un flash
Io mi ero illusa di noi
Ma non è giusto farne un dramma
Tanto so chi sei

Un gioco che non vinco mai
Il mio sbaglio più grande
Che rabbia che mi fai
Il vuoto sotto i passi miei, sei
Il mio sbaglio più grande
Ma che rifarei

Mi contraddico coi miei baci
Ma è così
Spegni tutte le luci e
Va da se che sono persa di te

Un gioco che non vinco mai
Il mio sbaglio più grande

Un gioco che non vinco mai (non vedi)
Il mio sbaglio più grande
Che rabbia che mi fai
Il vuoto sotto i passi miei sei
Il mio sbaglio più grande
Ma che rifarei

(Un gioco che non vinco mai) sei un gioco che non vinco mai, non vedi

Laura Pausini,"Che cosa ha lei che io no ho
Che cosa ha più di me
Sto cercando una ragione, anche se alle volte sai non c'è

Ero qui, eri qui
Ma poi non è andata sai proprio così

E una vita sola non può bastare
Per dimenticare una storia che vale
Nei tuoi occhi che mi stanno a guardare, non dimenticare

È difficile per me imparare a vivere
Senza abbandonarmi al mio presente
Inaspettatamente senza te

Ero qui, eri qui
Parlarne adesso non ha più senso, o forse si

Perché una vita sola non può bastare
Per dimenticare quanto si può amare
Al tuo nome e alla tua voce pensare
Senza farmi male

E una vita sola non può bastare
Per dimenticare una storia che vale 
Ogni minimo particolare, non dimenticare, non dimenticare

Eh, eh, eh
Ero qui
Che cosa ha lei che io non ho
Eri qui
Che cosa ha più di me
Sto cercando una ragione
Parlarne adesso non ha più senso o forse si

Perché una vita sola non può bastare
Per dimenticare come si può amare
Quanto sole che ci può attraversare
Senza farci male

E una vita sola non può bastare
Per dimenticare ogni particolare
Dei tuoi occhi che mi stanno a guardare
Non dimenticare, una storia che vale

Laura Pausini,"È un'emergenza d'amore
Il mio bisogno di te
Un desiderio così speciale
Che assomiglia a un dolore per me

È un'emergenza d'amore
È no, non si chiede perché
È un canto libero, verso il mare
Questo viverti dentro di me

Sei il vino e il pane
Un'esigenza naturale
Sei un temporale che
Porta il sole da me, dolcemente

Mi spiazzi il cuore ed io, ti porterò
Dentro le mie tasche, ovunque andrai
Come una moneta, un amuleto
Che tra le mie mani, burlerò

È un'emergenza d'amore
Questo volerti per me
Averti addosso per non fare asciugare
Dalla bocca il sapore di te

Sei il bene e il male
Una battaglia un carnevale
Sei la passione che
No, non ha tregua per me, dolcemente

Mi spiazzi il cuore ed io, ti porterò
Dentro le mie tasche, ovunque andrai andrai
Come una moneta, un amuleto
Che tra le mie mani, stringerò

Sei la mia prigione, l'evasione dentro me
Oltre la ragione
Solamente io conosco cosa c'è
Quell'amore che io ho per te

Io te porterò
Dentro le mie tasche, ovunque andrai
Come un incantesimo segreto
Per i giorni vuoti che vivrò
Per inseguirti in ogni viaggio, che farai
Dentro le mie tasche, ovunque che andrai
Come una moneta, un amuleto
Che tra le mie mani, stringerò",Un'emergenza d'Amore

I start to relieve you

Let you in once again and surrender?
Should I care?

Were you just to pretend?

Cada día un nuevo color me das
En cada gesto en cada fantasía
En tu sonrisa de melancolía

Como un tren en marcha hacia mí
Con mis emociones y los mil si
Tu mirada es una caricia más
Sabes en mis sueños como entrar

Todo va deprisa entre los dos
No me perteneces, ni a ti yo
Cómo no nos damos tiempo para amar completamente

Es tal vez lo que no quieres tú
Trato de observarte pero no consigo verte

Sigues en mi vida mucho más
Entre mis silencios, más allá
Con un soplo de serenidad
Alba de una nueva libertad

Eso que antes nunca comprendí
Claro ante mis ojos por fin lo vi
Mírame de nuevo como ayer
Haz volar mis sueños otra vez

Si se te ponen los ojos grandes como a un niño
No es imposible, sabrás
Amar completamente
Plenamente

Eso que antes nunca comprendí
Claro ante mis ojos por fin lo vi
Tu mirada es una caricia más
Llega donde nunca ningún otro pudo estar estar",Amar Completamente

Laura Pausini,"Yo ayer he entendido que 
Desde hoy sin ti comienzo otra vez 
Y tú aire ausente 
Casi como si yo fuese transparente 
Alejándome de todo 
Escapar de mi tormento

Pero me quedo aquí 
Sin decir nada sin poder despegarme de ti 
Y eliminar cada momento que nos trajo el viento y 
Poder vivir 
Como si no nos hubiéramos amado. 

Yo sobreviviré 
No me preguntes cómo no lo sé 
El tiempo cura todo y va a ayudarme 
A sentirme diferente 
A que pueda olvidarte 
Aunque es un poco pronto 

Me quedo inmóvil aquí 
Sin decir nada sin poder aburrirme de ti 
Y eliminar cada momento que nos trajo el viento y 
Poder vivir 
Como si no nos hubiéramos amado 

Como si nunca te hubiera amado 
Como si no hubiese estado así 
Y quisiera huir de aquí, quisiera escaparme

Pero me quedo otra vez, sin decir nada, sin gritarte
Ven, no te vayas
No me abandones sola en la nada, amor 

Después, después, después viviré 
Como si no nos hubiéramos amado

Como si nunca te hubiera amado",Como Ci No Nos Hubiéramos Amado
Laura Pausini,"Crónica del día en que
El águila voló
Donde el aire es ceniza en el confín
Historia de ese niño que
El águila encontró
Y le tendió sus brazos
A quien sus brazos le robó

Así un soldado confesó
De como el cielo oscureció
En tierra lágrimas lloró
Gritando su dolor
¿Qué significa libertad?
¿Qué puede ser tener piedad?¨
No puede ya creer en su bandera si
Hay sangre que verter

El águila no duerme ya
Sus héroes mato
Lleva a gala las estrellas que ganó
Pero el niño es huérfano de casa y alegría
Por lo indiferente que
La guerra puede ser

Así un soldado confesó
De como el tiempo se paró
La tierra lágrimas lloró
Granizo derramó
¿Qué significa la verdad?
¿qué puede ser tener piedad?¨
No puede ya creer en su bandera si
Hay sangre que verter

¿Qué significa libertad?
¿Qué puede ser tener piedad?¨
El sol que nunca más saldrá

Laura Pausini,"Hoy volví a pensar en ti
Haré siglos que
No te llamo, ni tu a mi, ah

A nadie mas dije amor
A nadie, a nadie
Desde entonces ninguno encontré
Que se parezca a ti
Que se parezca a mi, por dentro

Escucha atento el mensaje que es para ti
Dime si estas, ahí
Que yo te conozco y se que no vas a tener
Alternativa a mi
Lo se, lo s
Porque lo se

Te diría una mentira
Si dijese que
No he tenido compañías, ah
Ni roce otra piel

Busque en cada boca encontrar
Tu nombre, tu nombre
Espere demasiado y al fin
Ya te borre de mi
Ya me aleje de ti, lo sabes

Escucha atento el mensaje que mando aquí
Dime si estas, ahí
Que yo te conozco y mi puesto no es junto a ti
Se depender de mi

Añoraras cosas de mi
Que ya nunca mas tendrás, oh

Escucha atento no vas a tener

Emociones latiendo intensas en mí por ti

Háblame, por favor no me destruyas más como contigo hice yo
Oh, no no y dime si se ha acabado o tal vez no o tal vez no
En tu sufrimiento un soplo de viento, que te grita amor inmenso
Necesito que vuelvas a mí 

En mis manos, en mi cabeza, en mis músculos
Emociones latiendo intensas son así

Como si hubiese sido solo un sueño
Que vivimos esos meses únicos 
Y no buscarte más

Mas no es tan importante
Un instante solo de melancolía
Resbalando en las miradas de la gente
Caminando indiferente, vida mía

Culpa de un verano 
Del perfume de una noche de un momento que
Que nunca olvidaré
Guiados del deseo de sentirnos
De repente siempre más cercanos
Casi quemándonos
Ya es demasiado tarde, ni lo pienses 
No es momento de olvidar y renacer
De no buscarte más

No lo sé, pero pienso siempre en ti

Di come il cielo si oscurò

E che significato ha? 
Non si può credere a una bandiera se 
È il sangue a vincere, vincere

L'aquila non dorme mai 
Sacrifica i suoi eroi 
Mette in mostra le sue stelle e suoi trofei 

Il bambino è orfano di casa e di poesia 
Per l'indifferenza che 
La guerra ha dentro se 

Ed un soldato raccontò 
Di come il tempo si fermò

D'aceto e grandine

E che significato ha? 
Non si può credere a una bandiera se 
È il sangue a vincere

Ho bisogno di te
Di averti qui per dirti che

E mi manchi amore mio
Così tanto che ogni giorno muoio anchi'io
E in assenza di te
Il vuoto è dentro me

Grido il bisogno di te
Perché non c'è più vita in me
Vivo in assenza, in assenza di te",In Assenza di Te [Live]
Laura Pausini,"No necesito más de nada ahora que 
me iluminó tu amor inmenso fuera y dentro. 

Créeme esta vez 
créeme porque 
créeme y verás 
no acabará, más. 

Tengo un deseo escrito en alto que vuela ya 
mi pensamiento no depende de mi cuerpo. 

Créeme esta vez 
créeme porque 
me haría daño ahora, ya lo sé. 

Hay gran espacio y tú y yo 
cielo abierto que ya 
no se cierra a los dos 
pues sabemos lo que es necesidad. 

Víveme sin miedo ahora 
que sea una vida o sea una hora 
no me dejes libre aquí desnudo 
mi nuevo espacio que ahora es tuyo, te ruego. 
Víveme sin más vergÃ¼enza 
aunque esté todo el mundo en contra 
deja la apariencia y toma el sentido 
y siente lo que llevo dentro. 

Y te transformas en un cuadro dentro de mí 
que cubre mis paredes blancas y cansadas. 

Créeme esta vez 
créeme porque 
me haría daño una y otra vez. 

Sí, entre mi realidad 
hoy yo tengo algo más 
que jamás tuve ayer 
necesitas vivirme un poco más. 

Víveme sin miedo ahora 
que sea una vida o sea una hora 
no me dejes libre aquí desnudo 
mi nuevo espacio que ahora es tuyo, te ruego. 
Víveme sin más vergÃ¼enza 
aunque esté todo el mundo en contra 
deja la apariencia y toma el sentido 
y siente lo que llevo dentro. 

Has abierto en mí 
la fantasía 
me esperan días de una ilimitada dicha 
es tu guión 
la vida mía 
me enfocas, me diriges, pones las ideas.

y siente lo que llevo dentro.",Viveme [Unplugged] [Live] [Unplugged Version]
Laura Pausini,"E tu
Chissà dove sei
Anima fragile
Che mi ascoltavi immobile
Ma senza ridere.
E ora tu
Chissà dove sei
Avrai trovato amore
O come me, cerchi soltanto d'avventure
Perché non vuoi più piangere!

E la vita continua
Anche senza di noi
Che siamo lontano ormai
Da tutte quelle situazioni che ci univano
Da tutte quelle piccole emozioni che bastavano
Da tutte quelle situazioni che non tornano mai!
Perché col tempo cambia tutto lo sai
Cambiamo anche noi
E cambiamo anche noi
E cambiamo anche noi!
E cambiamo anche noi!
",Anima Fragile
Laura Pausini,"In questo girotondo d'anime
Chi si volta è perso e resta qua
Io so per certo amico
Mi son voltato anch'io

E per raggiungerti ho dovuto correre
Ma più mi guardo in giro e vedo che
See'è un mondo che va avanti anche se
Se tu non ci sei più, se tu non ci sei più

E dimmi perché
In questo girotondo d' anime
Non see'è un posto
Per scrollarsi via di dosso

Quello che ci è stato detto
E quello che ormai si sa
E allora sai che see'è

see'è che see'è, see'è che prendo un treno
Che va a paradiso città
E vi saluto a tutti e salto su
Prendo il treno e non ci penso più

Un viaggio a senso solo senza ritorno
Se non in volo
Senza fermate nè confini
Solo orizzonti neanche troppo lontani

Io mi prenderò il mio posto
E tu seduta lì al mio fianco
Mi dirai destinazione paradiso
Paradiso città
",Destinazione Paradiso
Laura Pausini,"Dove sei e come stai
È difficile lo so lo sai

Fermo al rosso di un semaforo sei tu 
Che cerco nella gente 
A piedi in taxi o dentro gli autobus 
Due occhi che ti guardano e poi via
Come forti raffiche
Perdersi nel traffico 
E un claxon dopo l'altro chissà

Dove sei? 
Come stai? 
Cambierò se cambierai
Due perché siamo noi
Due lottatori due reduci

Due canzoni d'amore comunque io e te
Con le stesse parole seduti a un caffè
E vorrei solo dirti ora che te ne vai
Se amore amore vedrai di un amore vivrai

Ma stasera che cosa fai? 
Io che ti telefono 
Tu che non sei in casa 
Lasciate un messaggio
Ma è molto più veloce il nastro di me
Che non so mai che dire 
E allora proverò ad uscire 
Stasera io ti trovo lo so
Dove sei? Come stai? 
Non ci sei ma dove vai? 
Io sono qui, come te
Con questa paura d'amare per

Due minuti, due ore, un'eternità
Duellanti nel mare, di questa città
Dove tutti han bisogno d'amore
Proprio come noi due",Due

Le pietre di un sentiero di collina
Il falco che s'innalzerà
Il primo raggio che verra
La neve che si scioglierà
Correndo al mare

L'impronta di una testa sul cuscino
I passi lenti e incerti di un bambino
Lo sguardo di serenità
La mano che si tenderà
La gioia di chi aspetterà
Per questo e quello che verrà

Io canto

Corro nel vento e canto

Voglio cantare
Sempre cantare

L'odore del caffè nella cucina
La casa tutta piena di mattina
E l'ascensore che non va
L'amore per la mia città
La gente che sorriderà
Lungo la strada
 
I rami che s'intrecciano nel cielo
Un vecchio che cammina tutto solo
L'estate che poi passerà
Il grano che maturerà
La mano che lo coglierà
Per questo e quello che verrà

Laura Pausini,"La mia banda suona il rock e tutto il resto all'occorrenza

Sappiamo bene che da noi fare tutto e' un'esigenza

E' un rock bambino soltanto un po latino

Una musica che e' speranza una musica che e' pazienza

E' come un treno che e' passato con un carico di frutti

Eravamo alla stazione si ma dormivamo tutti

La mia banda suona il rock per chi l'ha visto e per chi non see'era

E per chi quel giorno li inseguiva una sua chimera

Non svegliate-ci oh non ancora

E non fermate-ci oh no per favore no

La mia banda suona il rock e cambia faccia all'occorrenza

Da quando il trasformismo e' diventato un'esigenza

Ci vedrete in crinoline come brutte ballerine

Ci vedrete danzare come giovani zanzare

Ci vedrete alla frontiera con la macchina bloccata

Ma lui ce l'avra' fatta la musica e' passata

E' un rock bambino soltanto un po latino

Viaggia senza passaporto e noi dietro col fiato corto

Lui ti penetra nei muri ti fa breccia nella porta

Ma in fondo viene a dirti che la tua anima non e' morta

Non svegliate-ci oh non ancora

E non fermate-ci oh no per favore no

La mia banda suona il rock ed e' un'eterna partenza

Viaggia bene ad onde medie a modulazione di frequenza

E' un rock bambino soltanto un po latino

Viaggia senza passaporto e noi dietro col fiato corto

Lui ti penetra nei muri ti fa breccia nella porta

Ma in fondo viene a dirti che la tua anima non e' morta

Non svegliate-ci oh no non ancora

Non fermate-ci oh no per favore no

O semplicemente la tua bianca schiena
E quell'orologio non girava
Stava fermo sempre da mattina a sera.
come me lui ti fissava
Io non piango mai per te
Non farò niente di simile, no mai
Si, lo ammetto, un po' ti penso
Ma mi scanso
Non mi tocchi più

Solo che pensavo a quanto è inutile farneticare
E credere di stare bene quando è inverno e te
Togli le tue mani calde
Non mi abbracci e mi ripeti che son grande,
mi ricordi che rivivo in tante cose
Case, libri, auto, viaggi, fogli di giornale
Che anche se non valgo niente perlomeno a te
Ti permetto di sognare
E se hai voglia, di lasciarti camminare
Scusa, sai, non ti vorrei mai disturbare
Ma vuoi dirmi come questo può finire?
Non me lo so spiegare
Io non me lo so spiegare

La notte fonda e la luna piena
Ci offrivano da dono solo l'atmosfera
Ma l'amavo e l'amo ancora
Ogni dettaglio è aria che mi manca
E se sto così, sarà la primavera
Ma non regge più la scusa, no no

Cuanto frio en esta vida
Y tú ya no me buscas tú

Cuanta gente me pregunta
Hurga dentro de mi herida
Que ya no cicatrizara

Hasta mi mejor amiga
Cada noche aquí
Le he jurado hacerle caso
La traiciono como a mí

Porque me siento tan herida
Que no sé, no sé
Si conviene más curarse
O interesa más ahogarse

Cariño mío que puedo hacer
No me resigno a estar así
Por eso yo que te amo
Vivo implorando
Ayúdame y te destruiré

Cinco días sin tenerte
Cuantas lágrimas perdidas
Y yo, enclavada a ti

Hago todo y más que todo
He tratado de escapar
He probado a despreciarte
Traicionarte hacerme daño

Porque en tu mar voy naufragando
Y yo no sé, no sé
Si conviene estar nadando
O es mejor dejarse ir al fondo

Cariño mío que puedo hacer
No me resigno a estar así
Por eso yo que te amo
Vivo implorando
Ayúdame y te destruiré
Si un día quieres tú volver de nuevo
Ya me dirás quien te perdonara
Por olvidar de ayer que no es un juego

Cuando bastaba un beso
y nada más hablándonos

Mi vida por eso yo que te amo
Vivo implorando
Ayúdame y te destruiré

",Cinco Dias
Laura Pausini,"En el mundo yo caminaré hasta sentir
Mis pies cansados que hacen daño
Yo caminare un poco más

Y a todos preguntaré
Hasta que habrá respuestas
Que me puedan dar

Yo preguntaré
Una vez más
Amaré en modo tan intenso

Que el corazón me dolerá
Dolerá como el sol inesperado
Y quemará

Quemará en el mundo
Yo trabajaré hasta  sentir
Que mis dos manos me hacen daño

Yo trabajaré una vez más
(Una vez más)
Amaré en modo tan intenso
Que el corazón me dolerá

Dolerá como el sol inesperado
Y quemará, quemará
Dolerá como el sol inesperado
Y quemará, quemará

En el mundo yo no te amaré
Para  que así el corazón
No me haga daño

Corazón frágil
Que me escuchabas siempre a mí
Pero sin sonreír

¿Ahora tú en donde estarás?
Hallaste amor, quizás
O como yo, buscas tan solo aventuras
Porque no quieres llorar más

Sin nosotros la vida puede continuar
Que estamos tan lejos ya
De todas esas situaciones
Que eran de los dos

De todas esas emociones que compartíamos
De todas esas situaciones
Que ya no regresaran

Tu dime cuando, cuando
No me miras ahora amor que
Estoy cansada
Porque pienso al futuro

Tu dime cuando, cuando
Somos Ángeles
Que buscan las sonrisas
No te vayas tan deprisa

Que yo tengo sed
Tengo sed de ti, viviré, si viviré
Todo el día para verte marchar
Entre recuerdos y esta

Extraña locura
Y el paraíso que no existe
Quien quiere, un hijo no insiste
Tú dime cuando, cuando

Por favor quédate tú otra hora
Y te diré que te odio ahora
Tú dime cuando, cuando
Lo sé no serás mío y en tu cara

Una sonrisa en tu mirada
Estoy sedienta

Veré que el mundo sigue tan feliz

Y tú no estás aquí

Y dime porque en este carrusel un sitio no se ve
En donde nos podamos todos quitar
Todo lo que ya se ha dicho y todo lo que se dirá
Y ahora sabes que yo que sé

Sé que tomo el tren que se va a paraíso ciudad
Les digo adiós a todos subo al tren
Cuando sale ya no pienso que
Un viaje en un sentido
Tiene sentido sin un retorno

Sin estaciones ni confines
Solo horizontes pero no muy lejanos

Y tú mirándome a mi lado me dirás
Vamos destino al paraíso

¿Y cómo estás?
Es difícil ver

Miradas que se cruzan y se van

Como viento rápido
En el caos del tráfico
Y un claxon tras de otro a pensar
Ah

¿Dónde vas?
¿Cómo estás?
Cambiaré
Si cambiarás

Somos dos, tú y yo
Dos luchadores
Dos héroes y dos canciones de amor
Por siempre tú y yo
Con la mismas palabras
La misma pasión

Yo quisiera decirte ahora que tú te vas
Si amor das, amor sentirás y de amor vivirás
Oh, oh, oh

Di esta noche di tú que eras
Llamo una y otra vez
Pero tú no estás en casa
Dejarme un mensaje

Tu voz me suena tan extraña que yo
Yo no sé qué decirte
Ahora yo saldré a buscarte
Sé que esta noche te encontraré
Eh

¿Dónde vas?
¿Cómo estás?
Yo no sé
¿Dónde estarás?

Estoy aquí, como tú
Con miedo de amarte ahora
Y por dos minutos dos horas
Una eternidad

Somos olas perdidas
En esta ciudad
Dónde nacen y crecen amores
Como entre tú y yo
Na, na, na

Cuando en la gente encontrarás
Solamente indiferencia
Quiero que nunca te olvides tú de mí

Y si no encuentras palabras
Especiales que decirme
Por favor no te preocupes
Puedo comprenderte

Para mi es lo más grande si me piensas un minuto
Porque puedo contentarme si me mandas un saludo

Y los días se prolongarán
No esperes a que acabe el día

Alzando nuestros brazos hasta el cielo
Como símbolo de libertad
Un derecho natural para la humanidad
Sintiendo en nuestra cara un aire nuevo

El instinto que no se nos va
La exigencia que ahora siento
Why que grita ya es libertad

También en junio es navidad
Con desearlo lo será
Si me dejas que te embarque
Por las olas de un inmenso mar

Contra aquellos que nos juzgan
Sin palabras ni la música

Alzando nuestros brazos hasta el cielo
Como símbolo de libertad
El derecho de soñar para la humanidad
Sintiendo en nuestra cara un viento nuevo

Una nueva posibilidad
La exigencia de encontrar una revancha más
Que grita ya

Abrázala, para encontrar
La alternativa sola why única
Abrázala, es libertad
Toda la esencia why la genialidad

Alzándonos, abrázala, es libertad
Toda la esencia why la genialidad

Media vida es mucho por quien 
Te quiere y te dice si 
Y así será siempre 
Y déjame admirarte una vez más 
Fuera pudores 
Cómplice de mis reacciones tu 
Bellísimo así 

Yo soy transparente lo se 
Cuando te hablo me ves 
Casi indecente 
Canto susurrando por ti 
Resuenas dentro de mí 
Así prepotente 
Y déjame admirarte un poco más 
En mil batallas 
Se que me revolucionaras

Laura Pausini,"Por ti desnudaré
El gesto más secreto
Con la íntima certeza
De que somos dos

Después te contaré
Del todo mi pasado
Por aquel que no has caminado
Eso que un día serás

Por ti yo robaré
Cada color al cielo
Dibujaré mis pies
Para alcanzarte hoy

Pintaré una huella, un sendero
Que me dirija hacia ti

No tendré más miedo de volar bien alto
Why diseñando un arco tú me sentirás
Sobre tus alas grandes que me dan resguardo

Como la flor que cae sobre la rama
Como un estruendo muere en el silencio why se
Que me descuidaré
Si no estás a mi lado

Me sentiré incompleta
En compañía de mí
Soy un libro que en blanco te espera
Contigo me puedo escribir

No tendré más miedo de volar bien alto
Why diseñando un arco tú me sentirás
Sobre tus manos grandes que me dan resguardo

Yo te diré entre tanto que te amo
Why tú serás la cura para renacer
Ya no tendré más miedo de quererte al lado
Why atravesando el tiempo me tendrás aquí
Sobre tus grandes alas, que nos lleven juntos

Hasta una luz divina para compartir
Por ti devolveré
Cada color al cielo
Al cielo su color
Why a mi me bastas tu

Cada día que amanece un desafío
Quién afrontará tomar las decisiones?
Más allá de un sueño inmerso en mis canciones

El sonido reconozco
De mi voz why de mi rostro
Why me fío de un pasado que llené de ingenuidad
De quien va del estupor hacia otra edad

Porque cuando creo verlo poco claro
Busco dentro el pensamiento mas sincero
Veo en un espejo el cielo
Why la geografía de mi camino

Soy yo, vuelvo a ser yo
Porque he aprendido a hacerme compañía
Dentro de mí, engañare a la melancolía
Bella como nunca yo me vi jamás

Codo a codo a mi destino
Escrito por las líneas de la mano
El tornado que me tira a un lado
Soy tan solo yo

Tengo la esperanza de que al fin pasó
El defecto es la experiencia que aun no hay ahora
Pero ya no me disgusta
Eso no me asusta

Soy yo, vuelvo a ser yo
Porque he aprendido a hacerme compañía
Dentro de mí
Repito una blasfemia, una poesía

Bella como nunca le escuche jamás, jamás
Vista fija al horizonte, al asfalto dejo mi semblante
Que es sentir la soledad?

Qué es? Ya quiero decidirlo hoy

Why no te vayas jamás

Porque, mientras que te quedes
Serás tú el más bello de mis males
Tú serás, en un mundo avaro
El oro por las manos
Why seré, seré lo mismo por ti

Admitirlo bastará
Por supuesto dolerá
Esta prueba es evidente
De un pasado estéril que
No concede réplicas

Así, siento en el espíritu
De ti, ese infinito anhelo why tú

Así, yo me perderé
Por la armonía celeste, de este éxtasis

Tan malherida, por la incivilidad

Así, en polvo me convertiré

De que insistiré
En lo que ha sido why es
Que aún existe porque se
Que junto a ti

He conocido días que
Fueron los mejores
Why el silencio puede hacer
Que surjan los rencores

Más tú eres como yo
Why ahora es como que
Nada fue
Es superfluo el admitir

Que al estar sin ti

Ti ostini a dire no
Negando un fatto ovvio

Tu necessiti di me
Nello stesso modo che
Anche io di te

Tu lascia che ora sia così
Prendi il sogno che ora è qui
E inizi a crederci
E non andare mai via perchè

Fino a che rimani
Sarà tu il migliore dei miei mali, tu sarai
Di quest'anni avari
L'oro nelle mani sarò, lo stesso anche io per te

E basterebbe ammattere
Che comunque quel che see'è
È la prova più evidente

Di un passato sterile
Non concede reppliche
Nel futuro ne al presente

Così, ormai
Non tornare indietro mai
Non sacrificare noi, lo sai

Fino a che rimani
Sarà tu il migliore dei miei mali, dei miei mali, tu sarai
Di quest'anni avari
L'oro nelle mani è sarò, lo stesso anche io, lo stesso anche io

Dei miei giorni sani
La cura nelle mani
Tu sarai
Lo sarò anche io, per te

È inutile che ormai
Ti ostini a dire no
Negando un fatto ovvio
",Un Fatto Ovvio
Laura Pausini,"E di chi sarà il coraggio allora se non sarà il mio
Se si spegne quella luce resto io
Di chi è la più profonda decisione
Al di la dei sogni appesi ad una canzone

Oggi riconosco il suono della voce di chi sono
E mi fido di un passato carico d'ingenuità
Di chi va dallo stupore ad un'altra età

Perchè quando sembra tutto poco chiaro
Se mi fermo alla ricerca di un pensiero
Scopro in uno specchio il cielo
È la geografia del mio cammino

Da me, torno da me, perchè ho imparato
A farmi compagnia
Dentro di me, rinasco e frego la malinconia
Bella come non mi sono vista mai io mai

Fianco al fianco al mio destino scritto nelle linee della mano
L'uragano che mi gira intorno sono solo io
Vedo la speranza infondo a quell'oblio
Il difetto è l'esperienza che non ho ancora
Ma non me ne prendo cura, non ho più paura

Da me torno da me, perchè ho imparato a farmi compagnia
Dentro di me, ripeto una bestemmia una poesia,
Belle come io non l'ho sentita mai, io mai
Occhi dritti all'orizzonte, sull'asfalto lascio le mie impronte

'cause'è la solitudine, 'cause'è
Ho voglia di deciderlo da me, da me
Torno da me, da me per non andarmene più via, torno da me

Del mio cammino
",La Geografia del Mio Cammino
Laura Pausini,"L'impressione è quella di
Non appartenersi più
Forse è già così
Lo avverti anche tu?

anche tu che ormai
Come me non sai
Che decisione prendere
L'impressione è quella che
Vale insistere

per quel che è stato e see'è
E ancora esiste anche se

insieme a te
Ho conosciuto giorni che
Erano migliori
Ma il silenzio che ora see'è
Fortifica I rancori

ma tu eri come me
E adesso è come se
Niente see'è

e' superfluo aggiungere
Come senza te
Ogni emozione in me
Diventa inutile
Anche tu oramai
Anche tu non sai
Che atteggiamento scegliere
Quello che non vuoi
Quello che non sai
Se vale insistere
Per quel che è stato e see'è
E resiste anche se

insieme a te
Ho conosciuto giorni che
Erano migliori
Ma il silenzio che ora see'è
Ci costringe a nuovi errori
A nuove scelte a nuovi amori
A nuove scelte
Senza te
Senza te

ma tu eri come me
E adesso è come se
Niente see'è
",L' Impressione
Laura Pausini,"Forse bastava respirare, solo respirare un po'
Fino a riprendersi ogni battito
E non cercare l'attimo, per andar via
(Non andare via)

Perché non pio' essere abitudine
Dicembre senza te,
Chi resta qui spera l'impossibile
Invece no, non s'è più tempo per spiegare
Per chiedere se ti avevo dato amore
Io sono qui e avrei da dire ancora, ancora

Perché si spezzano tra I denti
Le cose più importanti
Quelle parole che non osiamo mai
E faccio un tuffo nel dolore, per farle risalire
Portarle qui, una per una qui
Le senti tu pesano e si posano per sempre su di noi
E se manchi tu, io non so ripeterle
io non riesco a dirle più
Invece no, qui piovono I ricordi
Ed io farei di più, di ammettere che è tardi
Come vorrei, poter parlare ancora, ancora
E Invece no, non ho più tempo per spiegare
Avevo anch'io, io qualcosa da sperare davanti a me
Qualcosa da finire insieme a te

Forse mi basta respirare
Solo respirare un po
Forse è tardi, forse invece no",Invece No
Laura Pausini,"Anche d'estate nevica
Se la tua mente immagina
Se la tua casa è un albero
Di gomma piuma e canapa

Senti l'aria del mattino che sa d'incenso
E di primula
Ti rivedi in quel bambino che rincorre
Una libellula

Alzando le sue braccia verso il cielo
Come simbolo di libertà
Quel diritto naturale che ogni uomo ha

Sentendo sulla faccia un vento nuovo
Per l'istinto che non se ne va
L'esigenza che oggi provo che grida già in libertà

Anche l'inverno illumina se il tuo pensiero naviga
Se ti lasci trasportare oltre il male di chi giudica
Oltre il muro di un frastuono senza
Voce senza musica

Alzando mille braccia verso il cielo
Come simbolo di libertà
Quel diritto di sognare che ogni uomo ha
Sentendo sulla faccia un vento nuovo

Una nuova possibilità
L'esigenza di cercare una rivincità
Che grida già, un'altra via ora sarà
L'alternativa sola e unica
Da oggi sia, in libertà, ogni centimetro dell'anima

Liberamente alzandomi
Oggi sia in libertà
Con tutta l'anima
",Mille Braccia
Laura Pausini,"Col senno di poi non so se riavrei
L'entusiasmo
Avuto per noi e non ricambiato mai
Perchè in sintesi tu non sei così innocente

Ne trasparente come t'immaginai
Ho speso il mio tempo, il mio tempo però
Se è valsa la pena, io adesso non so
Propendo nel dirti di no

A te che non dai
Altro non dai che il profilo
E non concedi di più
Dimmi in questa storia

Quale sarà il mio beneficio
Se in ogni tua vittoria
Il sacrificio è simbolo

Non è, non è, che il mio per te
Ho alzato per te al cielo per te

Cattedrali, senza che mai
Nemmeno una volta, mi aprissi una porta tu
Inseguito un domani che ancora non see'è
Nelle mie mani, e neanche per te
Un senso alla fine dov'è?

Dimmi in questa storia
Quale sarà il mio beneficio
Se nella mia memoria
Il sacrificio, è singolo

Non è, non è, che il mio
Non è perchè, per te
Io non ho più lacrime

Tu dimmi in questa storia, quale sarà
Il mio beneficio, se per ogni tua vittoria
Il sacrificio è singolo, col senno di poi
Non so se riavrei l'entusiasmo

Dipingerò I miei piedi e ti raggiungerò
Per lasciare una traccia un sentiero
Che mi riporti da te

Non avrò paura di volare in alto
Disegnando un arco mi ritroverò
Sulle tue ali grandi che mi prenderanno
Come si appoggia un fiore sopra un ramo
Come un rumore muore col silenzio see'è

Io mi trascurerei se non ti avessi accanto
Mi sentirei incompleta in compagnia di me
Sono un libro interrotto incompiuto
Da sempre in attesa di te

Non avrò paura di volarti accanto
Disegnando un arco, mi ritroverò
Sulle tue mani grandi che mi salveranno
Io ti dirò soltanto, che ti amo
E tu sarai la cura per rinascere

Non avrò paura di volarti accanto

A manifestare come ancora vale

Questo lo so, e so anche che
Ci basta un giorno a me e a te
Poi torni tu o vengo io, ma non è un addio

Quanto non sai, quanto non sai di un mondo dentro
Che non hai, quanto non sai di me
Quanto vorrei, quanto vorrei quel sentimento
Che per me non hai provato mai

E adesso, cosa pretendi, se prendi la tua roba e te ne vai
Che mi arrendo, se tu ti offendi lo sai
Che con l'orgoglio non si può amare mai

In cui non ci sei

Io non sono
Che non contesta mai
Ama come sei

Che aspetta quando vai
Ti giustifica

Laura Pausini,"Quizá bastaba respirar
Solo respirar muy lento
Recuperar cada latido en mí
Y no tiene sentido ahora que no estás
¿Ahora dónde estás?

Porque yo no
Puedo acostumbrarme aun
Diciembre ya llegó

No estás aquí
Yo te esperare hasta el fin

En cambio no, hoy no
Hay tiempo de explicarte
Ni preguntar si te amé lo suficiente
Yo estoy aquí
Y quiero hablarte ahora 
Ahora

Por que se rompen en mis dientes
Las cosas importantes
Esas palabras
Que nunca escucharás

Y las sumerjo en un lamento
Haciéndolas salir
Son todas para ti
Una por una aquí

¿Las sientes ya?
Pesan y se posarán
Entre nosotros dos

Si me faltas tú (si faltas tú)
No las puedo repetir
No las puedo pronunciar

En cambio no
Me llueven los recuerdos
De aquellos días que
Corríamos al viento
Quiero soñar
Que puedo hablarte ahora 
Ahora

En cambio no, hoy no
Hay tiempo de explicarte
También tenía yo
Mil cosas que contarte
Y frente a mí
Mil cosas que me arrastran junto a ti

Solo respirar muy lento

Hoy en cambio no",En Cambio No [Around the World]
Laura Pausini,"Ya no tengo miedo de ti
Ya toda mi vida eres tu
Vivo tu respiro que queda aquí
Que consumo día tras día
No puedo dividirme ya entre tu y mil mares
No puedo ahora estarme quieta y esperarte

Yo que habría estado por ti
En un cualquier lejana ciudad
Sola,por instinto sabiendo amarte
Sola siempre ya junto a ti

No puedo dividirme ya entre tu y mil mares
No puedo ahora estar cansada de esperarte

No mi vida no,no aguanto amor
Hoy regresas o quédate
No vivo ya no sueño ya
Tengo miedo ayúdame

Mi vida no te creo amor
Te me vas y todavía
Me juras que es la ultima
Es mejor si no me fio

Busco en la noche en
Cada estrella tu reflejo
Mas todo esto no me basta
Ahora debo

Oh, no mi vida no
Aguanto amor
Hoy regresas o quédate
No vivo ya no sueño ya
Tengo miedo ayúdame

Mi vida  no te creo amor
Te me vas y todavía
Me juras que es la ultima
Es mejor si no me fio

No puedo dividirme ya entre tu y mil mares
No puedo ahora estarme quieta y esperarte

No puedo dividirme ya entre tu y mil mares",Entre Tu y Mil Mares [Madrid]

Se fue, y mi amor se cubrió de hielo,

Rompiendo en mil pedazos

Debe acordarse de mi,
Aunque se, que entre el y yo,
El cielo tiene solo nubes negras,
Le rogare, le buscare, lo juro, le encontrare,
Aunque tuviera que buscar en un millón de estrellas

En esta vida oscura, absurda sin el,
Siento que,
Se ha convertido en centro y fin de todo mi universo

Si tiene limite, el amor, lo pasaría por el
Y en el vacío inmenso de mis noches, yo le siento,
¡le amare¡como le pude amar la vez primera,
Que un beso suyo era una vida entera,
Sintiendo como me pierdo,

E la sua malinconia
Il silenzio senza tempo che pervade
Al tramonto la marea
Arriverai
Con la luna di settembre
Che verserà
Il suo latte dentro me
E ti amerò
Come accade nelle favole per sempre

Ti aspetterò
Senza andar via
Come fanno già le rondini nell'aria
Nella terra mia
Che invecchia ma
Sulla scia di un'altra età ballando
Sogna
Mentre la tenera luce dell'est
All'alba illumina speranze e ginestre
E il cielo è così...celeste
Celeste

Avrai libri, sandali e secchielli
Luminosi amarcord
Saranno neri come I miei I tuoi capelli
Ma in un attimo lo so
Volerai via
Verso l'isola lontana
Di una città
Come ho fatto un giorno anch'io
Amore mio
Perché il sole può scordarsi della luna

Ti aspetterò
E prima o poi
Arriverai senza nemmeno far rumore
Ti sentirò
E resterai
Mentre ormai le foglie cambiano colore
Al mio paese che ancora non sai
Dove l'autunno odora di caldarroste
E il cielo è così...celeste!

Come il soffio della vita
Che spalanca anche le imposte
E a sorridere ti invita
Anche quando non lo vuoi
Questo vento innamorato
Che anche tu respirerai che respirerai

E poi avrò il coraggio di aspettarti
Ancora un po'
E ti prometto che vedrai dalle finestre
Un cielo così...celeste

Tu non mi dire niente
Mi fermo a farti compagnia

Posso soltanto guardare il punto dove stai guardando tu
E posso solo pensare che ho già vinto se convinco te
Che sei speciale

Come le cose che non mi aspetto
Come quel grazie che arriva dritto
O quell'abbraccio che non smette mai
Di dare affeto

Come il profumo di una sorpresa
Di una speranza che si è accesa

È sempre casa

È quel sole d'ottobre che scalda roma

E chi ti batte le mani (ti batte le mani)

E quel che ho avuto restituire e lasciarlo a te

È un mondo inedito

Non ho in me memoria
Di nessun'altra che abbia la tua storia

Non cerco più nessuna scorciatoia

Alla mia consueta ansietà
E soffocava e mi rendeva schiava

Laura Pausini,"Si sientes aún el frío
Ven y te abrazaré
Contra mi
Que aquel escalofrío
Ya es pasado, no volverá más
Y todo aquel amor que no podré
Esconder en mas sitios
Que aquí
Y todo aquello por lo que viví
Ahora esta aquí

Donde quedo solo yo,
Donde solo quedas tu
Donde el mundo es un sin sentido
Aquí

Donde todo al parecer
Se detuvo alguna vez
Donde nada tiene sentido
Aquí

Donde aquello que no soy
Hoy lo asumiré por ti
Esa casa iluminada donde
Siempre te hallaré

Y vaga en mi cabeza
Como el tiempo por su inmensidad
El alma me atraviesa
Desgarrándome por la mitad
Con todo este amor que descubríy
Y ahora esta aquí

Donde quedo solo yo,
Donde solo quedas tu
Donde el mundo es un sin sentido
Aquí
Donde todo al parecer
Se detuvo alguna vez
Donde nada tiene sentido
Aquí
Donde aquello que no soy

Laura Pausini,"Quizá bastaba respirar
Solo respirar muy lento
Recuperar cada latido en mí

¿Ahora dónde estás?

Porque yo no
Puedo acostumbrarme aun
Diciembre ya llegó

No estás aquí
Yo te esperare hasta el fin

En cambio no, hoy no

Ni preguntar si te amé lo suficiente
Yo estoy aquí
Y quiero hablarte ahora 
Ahora

Por que se rompen en mis dientes
Las cosas importantes
Esas palabras
Que nunca escucharás

Y las sumerjo en un lamento
Haciéndolas salir
Son todas para ti
Una por una aquí

¿Las sientes ya?
Pesan y se posarán
Entre nosotros dos

Si me faltas tú (si faltas tú)
No las puedo repetir
No las puedo pronunciar

En cambio no
Me llueven los recuerdos
De aquellos días que
Corríamos al viento
Quiero soñar
Que puedo hablarte ahora 
Ahora

En cambio no, hoy no
Hay tiempo de explicarte
También tenía yo

Mil cosas que me arrastran junto a ti

And I'm looking for an easy way
To get on with my life

You´re the one to tell
I´ve been putting on a masquerade
I ain´t doing that well
Everything is crushed
And I'm losing this game
I can't help myself for wonder
Do you feel the same?

How could I ever say goodbye
Everyday is a monday
Without you by my side
I must have been a fool to try
`Cause everyday is a monday
Without you in my life

Tell me
It's a big mistake
'Cause I kind of learned my lesson

Laura Pausini,"Marco se n' andato e non ritorna più
Il treno delle sette e trenta senza lui
un cuore di metallo senza l'anima
Nel freddo del mattino grigio di città

A scuola il banco vuoto, Marco dentro me
dolce il suo respiro fra i pensieri miei
Distanze enormi sembrano dividerci
Ma il cuore batte forte dentro me

Chissà se tu mi penserai
Se con i tuoi non parli mai
Se ti nascondi come me
Sfuggi gli sguardi e te ne stai

Rinchiuso in camera e non vuoi
mangiare stringi forte al te
il cuscino Piangi non lo sai
Quanto altro male ti far, la solitudine

Marco nel mio diario ho una fotografia
Hai gli occhi di bambino un poco timido
La stringo forte al cuore e sento che ci sei
Fra i compiti d'inglese e matematica

Tuo padre e i suoi consigli che monotonia
Lui con il suo lavoro ti ha portato via
Di certo il tuo parere non l'ha chiesto mai
Ha detto, ""Un giorno tu mi capirai""

Chissà se tu mi penserai
Se con gli amici parlerai
Per non soffrire pi per me
Ma non facile lo sai

A scuola non me posso più
E i pomeriggi senza te
Studiare inutile tutte le idee
Si affollano su te

Non è possibile dividere
La vita di noi due
Ti prego aspettami amore mio
Ma illuderti non so

La solitudine fra noi
Questo silenzio dentro me
e l'inquietudine di vivere
La vita senza te

Ti prego aspettami perché
Non posso stare senza te
Non è possibile dividere
La storia di noi due

La solitudine fra noi
Questo silenzio dentro me
e l'inquietudine di vivere
La vita senza te

Ti prego aspettami perché
Non posso stare senza te
Non possibile dividere

Y a cosas que dejaste atrás 
Y las palabras tiernas, sin decir

Rostros sin nombre van entre la gente
No hay nada cierto todo es 
Aparente, yo tan solo tengo a mi vida 

Vive ya
Atrévete a vivir a fondo 
Vive ya, que tus recuerdos van pasando 
Vive ya, intenta dar a los demás de ti
Hasta cuando pienses que 
No tienes nada mas

Mas si tu vieses al hombre 
Al pie de los balcones 
Que duerme envuelto entre cartones 
Si tu escuchas al mundo, una mañana 
Si del sonido de la lluvia 
Vos que no lo creas estas presente, tú piensas 
En lo que piensa la gente
Dios después de ti estas solo tu

Laura Pausini,"Seduti qui, per terra così
In questa camera da imbiancare 
Felici di non chiedere di più
Dimmi di sì
Anche se qui c'è solo un tavolo come altare
E un pane da dividere

Avvicinati anche tu 
E permettimi di più 
La tua bocca sulla mia 
Per non andare via

E balliamo a piedi nudi 
Con la musica alla radio 
Più forte mentre gli anni passano
In questa casa che profuma 
In ogni angolo
Faremo il nostro simbolo

Avremo anche noi dolori 
Che forse non sapremo evitare
Nemmeno affrontare
Ma niente di noi perduto andrà

Semplicemente vincendo l'incuria del tempo
Danzando in due a passo lento
Con sentimento come adesso qua

Il tuo sguardo resterà 
Senza alcuna impurità
In ricchezza o povertà 
Non si consumerà (non si consumerà)

E balliamo a piedi nudi 
Con la musica alla radio
Più forte mentre gli anni passano
In questa casa che io 
Amo in ogni angolo 
E dove mi medesimo 

Tu fallo con me 
E non lasciarmi mai da sola 
Neanche un attimo
Non farlo o ne morirò",Con La Musica Alla Radio
Laura Pausini,"Tu non rispondi più al telefono
E appendi al filo ogni speranza mia
Io non avrei creduto mai di poter perder la testa, per te

Porque de pronto ya no me quería
Porque mi vida se quedo vacía
Nadie contesta mis preguntas
Porque nada me queda, sin el

Se fue
Se fue, el perfume de sus cabellos
Se fue, el murmullo de su silencio
Se fue, su sonrisa de fábula
Se fue, la dulce miel que probé en sus labios

Non c'è che il veleno di te sul cuore
Non c'è via d'uscita per questo amore
Non c'è non c'è vita per me, più
Non c'è non c'è altra ragione che mi liberi l'anima

Incatenata a notti di follia
Anche in prigione me ne andrei per te
Solo una vita non basta per me

En mi verano ya no sale el sol (ya no sale el sol)
Con su tormenta, todo destruyo
Rompiendo en mil pedazos esos sueños que construimos, ayer

Y se fue
Se fue, el perfume de sus cabellos
Se fue, el murmullo de su silencio

Non c'è non c'è vita per me, più
Non c'è non c'è altra ragione per me

Si existe Dios debe acordarse de mi
Aunque se, que entre el y yo
El cielo tiene solo nubes negras
Le rogare, le buscare, lo juro, le encontrare
Aunque tuviera que buscar en un millón de estrellas

En esta vida oscura, absurda sin el
Siento que
Se ha convertido en centro y fin de todo mi universo

Si tiene limite, el amor, lo pasaría por el
Y en el vacío inmenso de mis noches, yo le siento

(Se fue) che il veleno di te sul cuore
Non c'è via d'uscita per questo amore (se fue)

I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes, Oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Like a child you whisper softly to me
You're in control just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream, no end and no beginning
You're here with me, it's like a dream
Let the choir sing

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel a power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

Just like a prayer, your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me, you are a mystery
Just like a dream, you are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice your voice can take me there

Vieni a stringerti un po' qui con me
Quell'attimo di vento
È passato e non tornerà più

E questo amore che io non potrei
Più nascondere altrove ma qui
E tutto quello che io non saprei
Dire sta qui

Dove resto solo io
Dove resti solo tu
Dove il mondo non ha più senso
Qui
Dove tutto sembra che
Sia da sempre immobile
Dove il resto non ha più senso
Qui
Dove quello che non ho
Torna ad essere per me
Una casa illuminata a giorno
Dove trovo te

E vaga nella testa
Come il tempo e la sua immensità
Che scorre e mi attraversa
E il mio cuore si spacca a metà
E questo amore che io non saprei
Dire sta qui

Dove resto solo io
Dove resti solo tu
Dove il mondo non ha più senso
Qui
Dove tutto sembra che
Sia da sempre immobile
Dove il resto non ha più senso

Io ritorno perché altra scelta non s'è
Ricordando i giorni a un'altra latitudine
Frequentando i posti dove ti vedrei
Recitando i gesti e le parole che ho perso
E ritorno da te dal silenzio che è in me

Tu dimmi se s'è ancora per me
Un'altra occasione,  un'altra emozione
Se ancora sei tu
Ancora di più un'altra canzone fresca e nuova
Tu dimmi se ormai qualcosa di noi s'è ancora
Dentro agli occhi tuoi
Oh no, gli occhi tuoi

E ritorno da te perchè ancora ti voglio
E ritorno da te contro il vento che s'è
Io ritorno perchè ho bisogno di te, ho bisogno di te
Di respirare fuori da questa inquietudine
E ritrovare mani forti su di me
E non sentirmi sempre così fragile

Tu dimmi solo se s'è ancora per me
Un'altra occasione, un'altra emozione
Dimmi se ancora sei tu
Ancora di più la nostra canzone che risuona
Tu dimmi se ormai qualcosa di noi s'è ancora
Dentro gli occhi tuoi, oh no

Se ancora sei tu
Una canzone fresca e nuova
Tu dimmi se ormai qualcosa di noi s'è ancora
Dentro agli occhi tuoi,
Oh no, gli occhi tuoi
Dimmi solo se s'è e ritorno da te",E Ritorno da Te [New Version] [Version]
Laura Pausini,"Si sbaglia sai quasi continuamente
Sperando di non farsi mai troppo male
Ma quante volte si cade
La vita sai è un filo in equilibrio
E prima o poi ci ritroviamo distanti
Davanti a un bivio
Ed ogni giorno insieme per fare solo un metro in più
Ci vuole tutto il bene
che riusciremo a trovare in ognuno di noi
in ognuno di noi

Ma a volte poi basta un sorriso solo
A sciogliere in noi anche un inverno di gelo
E ripartire da zero, zero
Perché non se è un limite per nessuno
Che dentro se abbia un amore sincero
Solo un respiro

Non siamo angeli in volo venuti dal cielo
Ma gente comune che ama davvero
Gente che vuole un mondo più vero
La gente che incontri per strada in città

Prova e vedrai ci sarà sempre un modo

Verso il sereno

Ma gente comune che ama davvero
Gente che vuole un mondo più vero
La gente che insieme lo cambierà

Laura Pausini,"A volte mi domando se
Vivrei lo stesso senza te
Se ti saprei dimenticare

Ma passa un attimo e tu sei
Sei tutto quello che vorrei
Incancellabile oramai!

Sembrava un'altra storia che
Il tempo porta via con se
Tu non lasciarmi mai!
Tu non lasciarmi!

E più mi manchi, più tu stai
Al centro dei pensieri miei
Tu non lasciarmi mai
Perché oramai sarai
Incancellabile

Con la tua voce, l'allegria
Che dentro me non va più via
Come un tatuaggio sulla pelle

Ti vedo dentro gli occhi suoi
Ti cerco quando non ci sei
Sulle mie labbra sento la voglia che ho di te

Così profondamente mio
Non ho mai avuto niente io
Tu non lasciarmi mai
Tu non lasciarmi

E più ti guardo e più lo sai
Di te io m'innamorerei
Tu non lasciarmi mai
Tu non lasciarmi

Non farlo mai perché
Se guardo il cielo
Io sento che sarai
Incancellabile oramai oh no!

No, no
Tu non lasciarmi mai
Tu non lasciarmi

Incancellabile tu sei
Nei miei respiri e i giorni miei
Tu non lasciarmi mai
Tu non lasciarmi

La neve che si scioglierà correndo al mare.

I rami che s'intrecciano nel cielo,
Un vecchio che cammina tutto solo,
L'estate che poi passera,
Il grano che matutera,
La mano che lo corriera,

Laura Pausini,"Forse
Forse noi non siamo fatti per cambiare
Forse noi non lo saremo mai
Ma non è principio imprescindibile
Di ciò che sei per me

And when the nighttime's falling and my
Eyes are closing you appear.
And buried deep inside is all the
Love that you don't know I hold.

Lascerò che sia il tempo a decidere chi sei per me.
Lascerò all'istinto e dal buio tutto tornerà.

Limpido (limpido)
Limpido

Yes, at times,
You found it hard to understand me
Shaping how you wanted me to be.
I'm still here while fragments of the past return
And it's not what you think.

E so che sostenere il colpo non sarà mai facile
Ma so che non importa in fondo ciò che penserai di me.

Letting go, no more fighting,
Time will show you what you mean to me.
Letting go free my instincts from the darkness I will re-emerge.

Lascerò (lascerò) che sia il tempo a decidere chi sei per me.

Laura Pausini,"I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never a honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Laura Pausini,"Il tempo non ha tempo
Te lo prendi oppure se ne va
Scrivilo negli occhi
Fai di un attimo l’eternità
Nella corsia delle emozioni
Io ti accompagno e tu mi sostieni
Ci proviamo insieme?

Il tempo è una conquista
Che ti costa quello che ti da
Non è una sconfitta
È da sempre un’opportunità
Nella corsia dell’emozione
Viaggio in salita e c’è chi mi sostiene
Ci proviamo insieme noi?

Per ogni volta che mi cercherai

Quale destino è destinato a noi?
Per ogni volta che ho rischiato
Un sentimento e ho vinto

Ma sapevo che era una bugia
Quanto tempo perso dietro a lui

Che promette e poi non cambia mai
Strani amori mettono nei guai
Ma, in realtà, siamo noi

E lo aspetti ad un telefono
Litigando che sia libero
Con il cuore nel lo stomaco

Un gomitolo nell’angolo
Lì da sola, dentro un brivido
Ma perché lui non c’è

E sono, e sono, e sono strani amori che
Fanno crescere e sorridere
Fra le lacrime
Quante pagine lì da scrivere
Sogni e lividi da dividere

Sono amori che spesso a questa età
Si confondono dentro a quest'anima
Che si interroga senza decidere
Se è un amore che fa per noi

E quante notti perse a piangere
Rileggendo quelle lettere
Che non riesci più a buttare via

Dal labirinto della nostalgia
Grandi amori che finiscono
Ma perché restano nel cuore

Strani amori che vanno e vengono
Nei pensieri che lì nascondono
Storie vere che ci appartengono
Ma si lasciano come noi

Strani amori, fragili
Prigionieri, liberi
Strani amori mettono nei guai
Ma, in realtà, siamo noi

Strani amori, fragili
Prigionieri, liberi
Strani amori che non sanno vivere
E si perdono dentro noi

Mi dispiace devo andare via
Questa volta l’ho promesso a me
Perché ho voglia di un amore vero
Senza te, senza te",Strani Amori [New Version] [Version]

That the fire in your heart is out

Laura Pausini,"It's knowin' that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind",Io canto/Je chante

Un letto in ordine uno specchio
Dove ancora trova spazio un tuo riflesso

Un pianoforte senza voce
Che piu’ suona e piu’ non sento le sue note

Vola verso quell’immagine

Le mie mani fredde e I miei capelli
Neri lunghi sulle spalle
Le labbra un po impacciate sussurravano
Non mi guardare non ti fermare
Pelle contro pelle il tuo sorriso
Non servivano parole

Mentre se ne andava il sole
E nella camera 200 note

Ogni vita ha puntualmente
Il suo destino da incrociare
Da sfiorare anche un attimo soltanto
E forse è vero quello che ti porti dentro
È sempre tutto cio’ che
Non hai mai potuto avere accanto
E quindi cerco di respingere le tracce
Di un ricordo lontanissimo

E nella camera 200 note

Ed è cosi che va la vita e il suo percorso
In equilibrio tra il rimpianto ed il rimorso
E restiamo a curare I nostri pezzi di cuore
Che siamo il sangue che scorre e che inventa l’amore
Il passato è passato e non c’è niente da fare
Lo puoi perdere o lo puoi cercare
In queste notti cosi vuote
E nella camera 200 note",200 Note

Chiedilo al cielo
Forse ce lo dirà
Cosa succede contro la volontà
Come un grattacielo che precipita

Cosa succede contro la volontà
Come un grattacielo precipita
L’impatto vanifica
L’intera costruzione di un amore
A volte ci si perde per errore

Dopo tanta polvere la pace
Non farà rumore quando cadono
Le foglie in pieno ottobre

Chiedilo al cielo
Forse ce lo dirà
Quando lo scopri dimmi come si fa
Come un tempo perso si recupera
E l’ abbraccio si fortifica
Se è vero che una volta è stato amore

Chiedilo al cielo
O chiedilo a chi lo sa
Quando lo scopri dimmi come si fa
Come un tempo perso si recupera
E l’ abbraccio si fortifica
Se è vero che una volta è stato amore
Se tutto si riduce ad un errore",Chiedilo al Cielo
Laura Pausini,"Dimmi che cosa vuoi da me? 
Dimmelo pure con parole tue
Menti con quelle tre che hai
Menti ma non ti penti

Colpevole
Se non lo sai
Di avere preso troppo a tutti noi
Perchè stai qui
Cosa ci fai? 
Anche col trucco resti ciò che sei
Non è con una ruga di dolore
Che copri quelle della falsità
Divertiti
Fallo via di qui
Ora levati

Danni ne hai fatti come no
Gli anni li paghi tutti e subito
Sconti la poca dignità
Perdi e non ti ricordi

Colpevole
Se non lo sai
Come ti muovi non mi muoverei
Come si sta
Di plastica? 
Capolavoro di mediocrità
Non è rubando la parola agli altri
Che si diventa ricchi come vuoi
Divertiti
Ma fallo via da qui
Ora levati

Con il tempo
Cambia il vento
Ti avrei perdonato
Ma il tuo istinto
Nel frattempo
Non si è mai pentito

Perdonati
Se ce la fai
Tu che l'amore non l'hai dato mai
Stai sempre qui
Sempre addosso a noi
Anche col trucco resti ciò che sei
Non è con una ruga di dolore
Che copri quelle della falsità
Divertiti
Fallo via da qui
Ora levati

Laura Pausini,"Lei è l’essenza più dolce
E l’assenza più atroce

Primo vero ideale

Lei mi accompagna e mi ascolta
A lei piace imitarmi
A lei piace volare

Laura Pausini,"Ho creduto a me
Ferma a una stazione
Vuota di alleria
Piena di persone
Vince chi rimane
Io resto

Ho creduto a me
Come fossi un'altra
Che mi dice passa
Passa anche stavolta
Che mi dice ascolta
Quello che sai già

Volevo solo appoggiarmi a un cuore
E avere il tempo per costruire

Quando per non dire troppo
Non ho detto mai
Quando il sangue nelle vene
Era piombo ormai
Quando hai detto mi spiace
Troppo poco però
E hai deciso di andare
Io purtroppo no

Ho creduto a me
Ai miei occhi scuri
Come certe sere
Quando non respiri
Quando cade il cielo
Ma non muori tu

E finisci qui
Questa pioggia fine
Che svernicia l'aria
Come una stagione
Ho mentito a tutti
Ma ho creduto a me

Volevo solo sparare a un cuore
Un colpo senza silenziatore

Quando per non dire troppo
Io non ho detto mai
Quando il sangue nelle vene
Era piombo ormai
Quando hai detto mi spiace
Troppo poco però
E hai deciso di uscire
Di tacere un dolore
Io davvero no",Ho Creduto a Me

Laura Pausini,"Dalla strada dietro casa
Ogni sera arrivi tu
Col tuo cane e con la spesa
Con il tuo maglione blu

Entri dentro l'ascensore
Scusi lei a che piano va? 
Poi sorridi ed io mi illumino

Guarda come sei
Incantevole
Sei quello che non da
Ne regole ne fragole
Mi piaci come sei
Un po ingannevole
Per questo ti vorrei
E dove sei? 
Nella porta accanto
Nella porta accanto

Coincidenza che ci sei
Perché io non mi accontento
Quasi mai
Ma io ti osservo di nascosto ed hai
Un quadrifoglio in bocca
E te lo mangerei

Ho aspettato questo giorno
Ed ora tu sei qui

E guarda come sei
Più incantevole
Sei quello che non sa
Di regole e di fragole
Lo vedi come sei? 
Inconsapevole
Er questo ti vorrei
E dove sei? 
So dove sei
Nella porta accanto
Nella porta accanto

Il tuo unico difetto
È di non svegliarti accanto a me

Ti prendo come sei
Ariete o vergine
Vestiti e scatole
Ma riempirle di fragole
E dimmi che non sei
Più irraggiungibile
Perché io ti vorrei
E dove sei? 
So dove sei

E so dove sei
Nella porta accanto
Forse esisti per davvero",Nella Porta Accanto
Laura Pausini,"Siamo arrivati fino a qui
Ed io nemmeno ci credevo
Io reduce di un pianto
E tu guardiano silenzioso
Ci siamo ritrovati in due
Ed ora neanche ci contiamo
Qualcuno esce gli altri dormono
Fai piano

Ti ricordi
Come cominciò? 
Ti dispiace stringermi la mano? 
Io ti ho risposto non lo so
Ti ricordi
Come continuò
Ti dispiace adesso se ti amo?
Con gli occhi chiusi ho detto, no
Poi scoppiò la vita
Che di più non può

Si nasconde ovunque
Il nostro amore quotidiano
Nella mia valigia
E nei tuoi voli in aeroplano
Nelle partenze all'alba improvvisate
Nelle mimose a marzo già fiorite
In un miracolo che è tutto qua
Nella normalità

Li ho visti crescere così
I giorni come I sentimenti
E trasformarsi in cose semplici per noi
Ti ricordi
Come cominciò? 
Me ne vado oppure ci baciamo
Comincia prima tu però

Si nasconde ovunque
Il nostro amore quotidiano
Nelle decisioni e nelle pieghe del destino
Nelle partenze verso chissà dove
Nelle mimose nate nella neve
In un miracolo che è tutto qua
Nella normalità

Questo ti darò
Il mio impegno unico
I miei occhi accesi e timidi
Sul presente che ora ho
Si questo ti darò
Altro non desidero
Niente meglio di così
Niente meglio di così

Si confonde ovunque
Il nostro amore quotidiano
Anche nei versi di questa canzone
O in tutto quello che racconterà
In un miracolo che è tutto qua
Nella normalità

E per amarci non ci servirà

Per la musica

E tu che ne hai fatta di strada
Per essere qua
Ogni chilometro ha un'anima
E mille identità

Noi siamo quelli che restano svegli
E ci salviamo in un attimo
Per la musica

E domattina ti svegli
Vicino a chi pare a te
Dove ci hai messo del bene
Non servono regole

Sei nel respiro del vento che muove
Le onde le gambe e lo spirito

Per la musica

Io non mi scordo più
Di queste note infinite e tu
Canta la musica
Con chi ti sta di fianco
Che ti sta di fianco
Perché qui l'hai portato tu

Elettrica e libera

Laura Pausini,"Lo sapevi prima tu
Ciò che sarebbe arrivato
Lo sapevi prima tu
Che l'hai disegnato

Quando non ero ancora un nome
Quando non ero ancora amore
Lo sapevi prima tu
Che mi hai creato il cuore

In mezzo a tutta questa gente
Che mi ha presa per ciò che sono
Lo sapevi prima tu
Che questo sangue è buono

Prendimi tra le tue braccia
Prendi il colletto e questa faccia
Accarezzami piano piano
Con un gesto della mano

Come quando ero bambina
E per starti più vicina
Mi mettevo a gridare
Solo per farmi guardare da te

Lo sapevi prima tu
Del mio coraggio e del dolore
Che non mi avrebbe risparmiata
In questa vita che andava vissuta
Senza timori né barriere

Cercando cose che fanno bene
E ci hai creduto prima tu
Che mi hai insegnato a volare
Lo sapevi prima tu
Che ero pronta per sognare

Prendimi tra le tue braccia
Prendi il colletto e questa faccia
Accarezzami piano piano
Con un gesto della mano
Come quando ero bambina
E per starti più vicina
Mi mettevo a gridare
Solo per farmi guardare da te, da te

Se cambi I miei regali
Io ti perdonerò
In fondo siamo uguali
Anche se dici no
So che andrà tutto bene
Se lo facciamo insieme
Perché ti prendi cura
Di ogni mia paura

Prendimi tra le tue braccia
Prendi il sorriso e questa faccia
Accarezzali piano piano

Come quando ero bambina
E per starti più vicina
Mi mettevo a gridare
Solo per farmi guardare da te

Come quando ero bambina
E per starti più vicina
Mi mettevo a cantare

E adesso guardami nella tua vita
Lo sapevi prima tu
Che mi hai concepita",Lo Sapevi Prima Tu
Laura Pausini,"Sono scappata via
Quando mi sono vista dentro a un labirinto
Senza decidere

Ospite in casa mia
Con sillabe d'amore tutte al pavimento
Come la polvere

Ma arrivi tu che parli piano
E chiedi scusa se ci assomigliamo
Arrivi tu da che pianeta?
Occhi sereni, anima complicata
Anima complicata

Io cosi simile a te
A trasformare il suono della rabbia
Io cosi simile a te
Un bacio in fronte e dopo sulle labbra
La meraviglia di essere simili
La tenerezza di essere simili
La protezione tra essere simili

Non mi domando più
Se ci sarà qualcuno a tendere la rete
Pronto a soccorrere
Me lo ricordi tu
Chi vola impara a sfottere le sue cadute
Come a difenderle
E cosi fai tu e nascondi piano
La tosse e il cuore nella stessa mano
Arrivi tu
Che sai chi sono

Io cosi simile a te
A trasformare il suono della rabbia
Io cosi simile a te
Un bacio in fronte e dopo sulle labbra
La meraviglia di essere simili
La tenerezza di essere simili

Arrivi tu che fai passare
La paura di precipitare

Io cosi simile a te
Liberi e prigionieri della stessa gabbia
Io cosi simile a te

La tenerezza di essere simili
La commozione per essere simili, ah ah",Simili
Laura Pausini,"Mi dici che c’è un mondo che non va
E vorrà dire che starò seduta
Ad aspettarlo qua
E se anche fosse dimmi poi che fa
Sono sempre stata appesa a un filo
Il mondo è senza età

E non importa più di resistere
Di quello che mi dai
Non so che farmene

Sono solo nuvole tra noi
E si dileguano
Di schiena andando via di scena
Senza dire una parola
Come quando il tempo passa
E non aspetta più per noi
Non aspetta più per noi

Mi dici che quel sogno più non ha
Da dormire su un cuscino arreso
Alla mia infedeltà
E più mi dici e parli e a me non va
Io voglio stare ancora appesa al filo
Tagliare il cielo a metà

E non mi importa più di resistere
E di quello che mi dai
Io non so che farmene
Sono solo nuvole tra noi
E si dileguano
Di schiena andando via di scena
Senza dire una parola
Come quando il tempo passa
E non aspetta più per noi

Non c’è pioggia tra noi

Sono solo nuvole tra noi
E si dileguano
Di schiena andando via di scena
Senza dire una parola
Come quando il tempo passa
E non aspetta più per noi

Sospesa a metà

E tutto in tasca va",Sono Solo Nuvole

Ho scelto un viaggio atipico

Ho dato acqua tanta
Alle mie quattro piante poi
Si vedrà

Ma curiosa e furtiva

E momenti lucenti
Io tornerò

Dal terrazzo migliore che c’è

Con calma si vedrà
Con calma si vedrà
Ho capito davvero che il tempo ha valore
E che niente e nessuno lo restituirà

Con calma si vedrà
Con calma si vedrà
Il lavoro mi piace ma il momento mi dice
Vai fino a dove non sei stata mai

Si nasce da egoismi e da conquiste
Si vive sparsi e spersi un po  qua e là
Le uniche radici che
Permettono di metterci
Seccano

Ho una parte di vita
Che ho saputo godermi
Io tornerò
Ho alle spalle giudizi
Ho calmato i miei vizi
Io tornerò

Affacciarsi sul mondo
Dal terrazzo migliore che c’è

Con calma si vedrà
Con calma si vedrà
Ho capito davvero che il tempo ha valore
E che niente e nessuno lo restituirà

Laura Story,"We pray for blessings
We pray for peace
Comfort for family, protection while we sleep
We pray for healing, for prosperity
We pray for Your mighty hand to ease our suffering
All the while, You hear each spoken need
Yet love is way too much to give us lesser things

'Cause what if your blessings come through raindrops
What if Your healing comes through tears
What if a thousand sleepless nights are what it takes to know You're near
What if trials of this life are Your mercies in disguise

We pray for wisdom
Your voice to hear
We cry in anger when we cannot feel You near
We doubt your goodness, we doubt your love
As if every promise from Your Word is not enough
All the while, You hear each desperate plea
And long that we'd have faith to believe

When friends betray us
When darkness seems to win
We know that pain reminds this heart
That this is not our home

What if my greatest disappointments
Or the aching of this life
Is the revealing of a greater thirst this world can't satisfy
What if trials of this life
The rain, the storms, the hardest nights
Are your mercies in disguise",Blessings

Though his eyes are weary, his arms are still open
And his prayer, so softly spoken

In that front porch rocking chair

Laura Theodore,"There's a story the gypsies know is true
That when your love wears golden earrings,
She belongs to you.
An old love story that's known to very few,
But if you wear those golden earrings,
Love will come to you.

By the burning fire,they will glow with ev'ry coal.
You will hear desire whisper low inside your soul.
So be my gypsy,
Make love your guiding light,
And let that pair of golden earrings
Cast their spell tonight.",Golden Earrings

Laura Turner,"Two lovers kiss on a silver screen,
It seems to natural and I believe,
What they have is what we're supposed to be,
Last night was pure exctasy,
The stage was set boy,
Just you and me,
But before I believe 
In dreams of destiny,

Was it just,
An illusion of a kiss,
An imaginary rush,
Just the feeling 
Of the reverating touch,
Was it just,
Just a temporary dream,
The performance of a chill,
Just a shiver in the mist,
The illusion of a kiss,

Tell me I'm not the only one,
It feels our future has just begun,
Hold me steady and look me in the eye,
How do I know if what I feel is right,
Or just a trick of the candlelight,
It's been a question burning 
Since the dawn of time,

Was it just the illusion of a kiss,
An imaginary rush,
Just the feeling 
Of the reverating touch,
Was it just,
Just a temporary dream,
The performance of a chill,
Just a shiver in the mist,
The illusion of a kiss,

Was it just the illusion of a kiss,

With wild ambition,
With nothing more than just a dream,

Knowing one day you 
Will hold it in your hand,
To keep it easy,
That you have something,
You appear an endless lie,
The very reason you're alive,
To make a difference each and every chance,

You know I'm yours for just the taking

Too soon, too soon,

That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here

Laura Veirs,"Twenty days walking so lonely and talking to myself and the rocks and sand
Got me to thinking 'bout going and drinking in a tavern with a clean-shaven man 

Just when I thought all souls had been bought by the devil here long ago
There did I see when I knelt to my knee I little texas flower grow 

Black-eyed susan by the roadside blooming all yellow like sunshine red like wine
Flower like you in a desert this cruel my my you're a rare rare find 

Well my newfound friend gave my heart a mend I sang her songs of my wayward ways
As day turned to night in the crystal moonlight I confirmed her unwavering gaze 

As the days unraveled I stayed in the gravel and susan kept her eye on me
With my eye on her I felt my heart all astir with the joy of camaraderie

Where sunlight moves like sadness across the room
Oh my sweet mama if you could only see me
Now drunk as a skunk falling out of this rundown lacy gown 

This blue ink this blue ink this blue ink
Across the page I write to you 

I'm sitting in these thorny cowboy boots
And scabby knees wondering why I left you mama
Just to do as I please no hat has a brim
Wide enough to block out the blazing sun
I met the devil on the road but I had no legs to run 

This blue ink this blue ink this blue ink
Across the page I write to you 

Silver ran off two towns ago I been walking alone
I been walking slow my eyes are dry from the desert wind
I know I ain't coming home to you again

When I'm dead and gone and the buzzards fly this blue ink across the page

Laura Veirs,"Did you see that lady there?
They stripped her to her underwear.
She took it one step further and stripped to bare.
Through the rising flames and smoke,
She laughed as all the police choked,
And then she danced in the government pyre.

The jailhouse is on fire.
The jailhouse is on fire.

She grabbed a guard and stole his keys,
Unlocked the cells, and set us free,
And we ran and caught our pants on the old barbed wire.
We hit the dirt we hit the road 
We jumped the fence, we kissed a toad,
And we hollered at the ladies in the churchyard choir.

The jailhouse is on fire.
The jailhouse is on fire.

I hopped a train and headed west, free woman now just like the rest.
All the hobos on the line called me a liar.

When I saw a distant glow
Of a farmhouse nestled down beneath the trees
With a guitar on my back
I thought it sure can't hurt to ask
If I could stay the night
And sing a pretty song for free

I walked up to the house
And then I knocked hard on the door
That old dark piece of wood
She fell right in there on the floor
And as she did a fire burst out on all sides
I wondered what the hell was going on inside

Then the music that I heard
It was bizarre, it was absurd
Like no banjo fiddle bass I'd ever seen
I stepped into a room of flames
Shook my head and looked again
It was the kind of company to make you scream

It was a devil's hootenanny 
An old-time fire band
A drunken whiskey choir singing 
Round me you understand
And then they said, ""We've been searching near and far
For a thing like you to sing and play guitar""

Well I opened up my case 
And all the blood rushed to my face
I sang a fragile note, picked a minor tune
Well those devils yelled and clapped 
And all their asses they did slap
Before too long we were arm and arm beneath the moon

'cause that old house burnt on down
There were cinders on the ground
I snuggled up inside, closed my eyes
I was sleeping sound
And I dreamt of summer nights down by the sea
With a devil's banjo playing on my knee

Of a stranger on the corner
A tiny little girl ties flowers to her wrists
And the bees come round to adorn her

A song the words I used to know
And as the melody went ringing
I felt my bones on the rocks below
The weighted trees of my only home

With brother sleeping right beside me
The blankets pulled up to his chin
The makeshift snow cave settled slightly
But held us in and sheltered us
Like mom and dad, they always helped us",Snow Camping
Laura Veirs,"Clear as ice, oh clear as ice
Dripping down from a rock
Spring will come and so will fall
All my enemies have finally fled
They've finally fled and gone

Take your pick, oh take your pick
And dig into the earth
You'll find a muted pearl its worth
It will never self-disclose
It's your job to dig and polish you know

All the colors spin, all the colors spin
Blackness from a pitcher pours
Stars come blowing through the door
Your eyes they mirror pools of ink
Your heart and mind combine to drink
From the puzzle's trough
But the troubles can be solved

Take jumps in wintry lakes
Feel the water's skin and face
Huddle up close nice and tight
We might absorb enough moonlight
Your kiss adorns a neighbor strange
Who's one of us again, again

The bats are swinging 'round me like drunken ships
Ever, evergreen bows above me tower
Singing quiet stories 'bout forgiveness

Pacing through the still around the bed
Halos of their royal breathing

I’m the only thing between you
And this heartbreak feeling?

They set you on the treadmill

Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in

The toughest role you ever played

And pain was the price you paid

Was that Marilyn who was found in the nude

Lauren Alaina ,"Back in forty one, you met a brown-eyed boy
Who called you pretty
He’d walk every day, couple miles out of his way
To hold your hand and keep you company
Your mama said, don’t call it love at fourteen
But sittin’ on that front porch swing

He gave you his picture in a locket
That you wore around your neck
Left it right beside your heart
So you would not forget
The way it felt when he held your hand
And you swore that you would never take it off
And the butterflies you felt said it all
You were falling for the boy inside your locket

Back in forty three, the brown-eyed boy went overseas
And had to leave town for a little while
He swore he’d marry you
As soon as the war was through
You would be his wife
Standing in the pouring rain
You cried as you watched him ride away

But everyday
You had his picture in a locket
That you wore around your neck
Left it right beside your heart so you would not forget

The way his kiss tasted on your lips
And everyday felt like a lifetime with him gone
And you prayed that God would bring him safely home
‘Cause you made a promise
To the boy inside your locket

Oh, sixty years you two had together
But he’s been gone for a couple now
And it breaks my heart to see you struggle to remember
But I’ve been writing all your memories down
And I stopped by today
To read a couple pages
Grandma, you sure look pretty
And you smiled that smile
The one I haven’t seen in quite a while
And you said to me, I want you to keep

His picture in a locket that I wore around my neck
The one I left beside my heart so I would not forget
The greatest love and the greatest man I’ve ever known
But it’s gettin’ time for me to head on home
She said, that brown-eyed boy is waiting
And I don’t want to keep him long
Heaven is calling
And she said, my heart is longing
For the boy inside your locket",The Locket
Lauren Alaina ,"I get this feeling every year
The first days of winter
Pull out that box of souvenirs
To read your old letters
In that stack of memories
Found a note you left for me
It almost feels like you’re still here

I hear your voice in every word
You told me to remember

Take each day and make it last
‘Cause you turn around and the future is the past
Here and now is all we have
The beginning and the end mean so little
What matters most is what’s in the middle

Makes me smile when I look back
To every summer
You’d forget your birthday and just laugh
And say, it’s just a number
But Sunday afternoons
They meant so much to you
The simple things were golden
You found beauty in every moment

Take each day and make it last
‘Cause you turn around and the future is the past
Here and now is all we have
The beginning and the end mean so little
What matters most is what’s in the middle

The day you’re born is just a start
Your last breath is a question mark
The story of your life is in the, in between

Take each day and make it last
‘Cause you turn around and the future is the past
Here and now is all we have

Take each day and make it last
‘Cause you turn around and the future is the past
Here and now is all we have
The beginning and the end mean so little
What matters most is what’s in the middle

Of that special, not so perfect guy

He ain’t too pretty, he ain’t too sweet
A little rough around the edges
Cute and country just like me

Mama lovin’, fishin’ pole carryin’
Swears a John Deere revvin’ up
Is music instead of noise
Dirt road, four wheel drivin’
Riverside Saturday night and
Sunday mornin’ church goin’ kinda boys

He ain’t gotta have money or a brand new truck
But he better shake my daddy’s hand

Gotta be a little reckless, a whole lotta fun
And he’s gotta know my midnight curfew

Holes in her shoes and freckles on her skin
Every time she saw those school doors open wide
She’d wanna turn around 
And run back home and hide
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh

You put it in my hair
Two bare feet up on the dashboard

Looking at you, looking at me
With the wind strapped to our backs
Flying as high as a bird in the sky
Don’t get much better than that

Love struck right on the money
Heartbeats a beating to the radio
Kisses sweet as the honey
Down in Tupelo
All the way down to Tupelo

Counting the white lines a mile by mile
Worries slipping away
Took a back road for a little slow down
Off of the interstate
We followed the river as far as it goes
Smiling in the July sun
Hearing you say, you were falling in love
I said, you ain’t the only one

And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend

Maybe only in our blind belief, can we ever find the truth

He was all I'd ever need
But I gave up what I wanted
And I gave him control
I lost myself in a deep, dark hole
I'm here to tell you that it's never too late
To cut the strings and to take back your fate
You'll find yourself again along the way

Just think outside the boy
Look right past his charm
He's not your definition
No, he ain't who you are
If you don't love yourself
You sure ain't gonna help
There's so much more to life than living like his wind-up toy

Oh, when the right boy comes along
He won't make you choose
When the right one comes along
He'll love that you think outside the boy
Oh, think outside the boy

If you don't love yourself
He sure ain't gonna help
There's so much more to life than living like his wind-up toy
Think outside the boy, ooh
Think outside the boy",Think Outside the Boy
Lauren Alaina ,"Three ways before I could even need
My brother's son, didn't see him turn one or two
Three months I haven't made Sunday service once
I'm out on the road praying alone
Every night for a sign that I'm doing this right
And I'm right where I'm supposed to be

Mama said, ""you'll be a star""
And daddy said, ""you're gonna go far, all you gotta do is sing your heart out""
A lot of miles, a lot of tears
You've given me some of my best years
There's so much I had to miss out on
Six years of missing home for three minutes on the radio

Three years of wishing that he was here holding my hand
No I didn't plan for those three words
To be the ones that hurt
They don't sound the same from so far away

Oh, my mama said, ""you'll be a star""
And daddy said, ""you're gonna go far, all you gotta do is sing your heart out""
A lot of miles, a lot of tears
You've given me some of my best years
There's so much I had to miss out on
Six years of missing home for three minutes on the radio

I'll do it for the three girls at my show
Who saved up for the front row
And the three times that I heard just this week that my words
Were sang by three year old
Hairbrush for a microphone
Little girl with a dream
And that girl was me, yeah

My mama said, ""you'll be a star""
And daddy said, ""you're gonna go far, all you gotta do is sing your heart out""
A lot of miles, a lot of tears
You've given me my best years
There's so much I had to miss out on
Six years of missing home
But I'd spend fifty more gone for three minutes on the radio",Three
Lauren Christy,"You and I moving in the dark
Bodies close but souls apart
Shadowed smiles and secrets unrevealed
I need to know the way you feel

[Chorus]
I'll give you everything I am
And everything I want to be
I'll put it in your hands
If you could open up to me oh
Can't we ever get beyond this wall

'Cause all I want is just once
To see you in the light
But you hide behind
The color of the night

I can't go on running from the past
Lave has torn away this mask
And now like clouds like rain I'm drowning and
I blame it all on you
I'm lost - God save me

'Cause all I want is just once
To see you in the light
But you hide behind
The color of the night

The things that I hide from are here
I used to run around late at night
Giving myself up without a fight
But now I see it, I see it clear

So come on, hold me tight
'Cause I was not a child afraid of darkness, but an
Adult afraid of the light
It's all coming back to me now, darling
The shadows I held in my arms
But my arms were weak, I let them slip away
Leaving me to face another day
But now I see it, I see it clear

The truth is here
So come on, hold me tight

Lauren Christy,"So long war 
Rock and roll has not been heard before 
In their long black cars 
Technicolor movies for the stars 
I wish I'd learn to dance the way my parents danced 
It seems I always try to lead the man 
Cause I can 
I wish that I was 25 back then 

London's high 
Marianne is faithful to the sky 
And a brand new beat 
Floating from a room across the street 
It wasn't only Armstrong up there on the moon 
It seemed everybody's head was in the sky 
Sometimes I 
I wish that I was 25 back then 

What I need is Jean Picard 
To teach me how to fly 
Get to meet whatever's out there 
Watching from the sky 
Bring back a new cigarette that 
Doesn't make you die 
Don't want a super highway 
Just want a super high 
Sometimes I 
I wish that I was 25 back then 
And the world moves on",25 Back Then

South of you and me
