Rotten Sound,"Wake up, get your act together, turn on the altered truth
There is no need to be scared as today is the day of achievement

Lies are consumed to live this day through
To give us some hope, and hide the hopeless future
Nobody wants us to see through this fake reality
Everyone is scared to learn how many lies can be told

Yesterday was worse, tomorrow will be the best
People on this planet shall evolve into a supernatural race

Lies are consumed to live this day through
To give us some hope, and hide the hopeless future
Nobody wants us to see through this fake reality
Everyone is scared to learn how many lies can be told

Lies are consumed to live this day through
To give us some hope, and hide the hopeless future to come
Altered truth, news filled with joy, reality with fake content
The faceless beings have achieved a total state of self mockery

Nobody wants us to see through this fake reality
Everyone is scared to learn how many lies can be told
And how many lies can be sold",Alternews
Rotten Sound,"Every pitiful day is wasted on useless things
Every measure is taken to make ridiculous commitments
Our openness leads us to total insanity
Our inner minds melt and cause instability and anxiety

Questioning is kept outside these blinded minds
During all the cruel days we go forward
We are blinded to be all alone in this world
We are bound to stay in front of those eyes

We are grinded by our ways to give
And it is time to let go and give away all there was before
The criticism against what used to be wrong is weakening
It is time to open the filthy box inside our senseless minds",Blind
Rotten Sound,"You were born into the wrong family
You got categorized from day one
Are you any worse than anyone else is
Or did your genes determine your fate?

It is time to learn to get by in your life
To accept where you came from
No sense in fighting back
You are born to be less than the others are

Poverty was invented to make smart people simple
The poor class is sustained to make right people wrong
There's no way to educate that unselected mind

The classified brain is destined to be untalented
No way to educate the useless brain
People from below shall breed into a class that stays low

You were born into the wrong family
You got categorized from day one
Are you any worse than anyone else is
Or did your genes determine your fate?

Poverty was invented to make smart people simple
The poor class is sustained to make right people wrong
There's no way to educate that unselected mind

The classified brain is destined to be untalented
No way to educate the useless brain
People from below shall breed into a class that stays low",Caste System
Rotten Sound,"We distrust everything we see
Take a look around, it won't be in there
No one will save us from our misery
Inside this depressive state

Possessed minds, blinded ways
And monstrous days to kill

We leap to a new destination
And greet other simple slaves
Pain eats something inside us

And fools have chosen to stay alone
They want to run this community
And the pool of stupidity leads our lives

Possessed minds, blinded ways
And monstrous days to kill

We distrust everything we see
Take a look around, it won't be in there
No one will save us from our misery
Inside this depressive state

Possessed minds, blinded ways
And monstrous days to kill ourselves",Days to Kill
Rotten Sound,"You believe and worship
Something that does not exist
The supernatural events
Were never proven to be true
Never, your future is to be saved
When you make a commitment

You are possessed to be immortal
And your department supports these lies
The immortality of the cheating leaders
Deceives this whole community
Immortal priests make you sacrifice your life

They are part of our nation
In the core of the corporation
Running the boards, giving commands
In the name of the CEO
The immortality of the cheating leaders
Deceives this whole community",Deceit
Rotten Sound,"We are heading back to the Stone Age
We are doomed to be saved

Things will become more simple
Through survival instincts
When the globe becomes overloaded
And the South is enslaved

Is there anything worth saving
As the cycles will take us back here again?
Cycles of insanity are cleaning up this globe
Through the decimation of this arrogant race in charge

Five thousand years from now
We'll see this again
The cycles of stupidity
The repeated history

Back to the Stone Age
We are doomed to be saved

Things will become more simple
Through survival instincts
When the globe becomes overloaded
And the South is exploited

Five thousand years from now
We'll see this again
The cycles of insanity
The repeated history

We are the cancer of this globe
The precious planet Earth is now polluted
Raped and molested by the retarded human race
That destroys it piece by piece",Decimate
Rotten Sound,"Every time the wise of mankind
Ask how to save ourselves
The inventions are being questioned
But the root cause is being ignored

Making a less consuming working class in the West
Won't help us at all when the South doubles the effects
It's time to affect all the companies that want
To save money in the East

Taking down this system that grows
Is the way to go even when the system to kill is protected
By the greatest armies and the most corrupted leaders
Taking down this system that grows is the way to go

Making a less consuming working class in the West
Won't help us at all when the South doubles the effects",The Effects
Rotten Sound,"Alone in my mind I know
That someone else is in control
My will was altered for the first time
Before I learned how to doubt

My will to live is almost gone
There is no need to suffer anymore
Deep down in my brain
I am becoming more afraid

There must be someone else
In charge of my inner self
My will to live is almost gone
There is no need to suffer anymore

Lies inside my pitiful head
Are what I need to go on
My will to give has gone
And I am alone
In this oppressing world

Demons from the past
Shall eat me alive at last
My will to live is almost gone
There is no need to suffer anymore

Lies inside my pitiful head
Are what I need to go on
My will to give has gone
And I am alone
In this oppressing world

Demons from the past
Shall eat me alive at last
Who took over my mind?
Who's controlling my head?
Who is in charge of my brain?",Enigma
Rotten Sound,"I hate those guts
Someone vanishes today
You stupid, sick, crippled bitch
The payback time has come

You are living through these days
By killing everything that lives
Where do you stand
And which way are you looking at?
I will eat you feet first
You slow minded bastard

All your friends are gone
It must feel bad to be alone
Your government has turned its back
And you are not needed anywhere anymore

The hole in your head is used by someone else
Your mouth releases words you do not even know
I will eat you feet first
You slow minded bastard

You're eaten alive, pray for your death
From your feet, from your feet to head
I'll eat you until you're dead

You are in charge of the leadership
Of the nation that kills other nations
Your feet will be gone when I'm done
The rest will be digested after your death

I hate those guts
Someone vanishes today
You stupid, sick, crippled bitch
The payback time has come

You are living through these days
By killing everything that lives
Where do you stand
And which way are you looking at?
I will eat you feet first
You slow minded bastard of the bastard",Feet First
Rotten Sound,"Loss of vitality, collapse of health
Lack of food and fresh water
Nobody feeds our poor
Nobody treats our sick

And the profit-making machines
Do not recognize humanity
The people who decide how much to give
Is giving them no reason to live

Sickness and selfish deeds of
The companies in charge of this world
Destroy all possible means
For the poor to get well

The crime they have done
Was to be born in the wrong family
Their lives are filled with misery
Because of this destiny

Children are starving to death
Leaving small with stinking breath
Nobody feeds our poor
Nobody treats our sick

And the profit-making machines
Do not recognize humanity

Sickness and selfish deeds of
The companies in charge of this world
Destroy all possible means
For the poor to get well

The crime they have done

Their lives are filled with misery
Because of this destiny",Poor
Rotten Sound,"Work gives everything one ever needs
Vacations have become obsolete
Stupidity, slavery, simplicity
Greed and insanity

Pleasure is not what we seek
We shall only dwell in our misery
Work gives everything one ever needs
Vacations have become obsolete

In the places we spend our time
We sleep but do not live and let go
Birth, education and work
Make us the slaves of this society
Stupidity, slavery, simplicity
Greed and insanity
",Simplicity
Rotten Sound,"Our minds are fed every day
The Internet feeds our needs
And we follow every single word
That has ever been told

It's time to get sick
Sicker than you ever were
Sicker than anybody else was
To stick the sickness
Into pieces of our minds

Do not be scared
Today is your day
Do not feel any pain
As this day was already sold
Sold out

We are spoon-fed with bent truth
We're taking it as if it were something new
Our minds are the subject of a global fraud
It is mindless to ignore it
And not to see through it all",Sold Out
Rotten Sound,"Promises made for commitments
With insane meanings
Nobody was able to see through
Their fake sincerity and dishonesty

Openness outside their twisted minds
Is deceiving everyone around them
They have said many things
They never meant to say

They can live with the lies coming out of their mouths
They have no second thoughts even when
They have deceived their precious beloved community
The simple human race is deceived by their leaders

The trust was gained over a very long time
Until they were nailed
Openness outside their twisted minds
Is deceiving everyone around them
In every possible way they know",Trust
Rotten Sound,"You saw what was coming
You could have resisted everything
It was our time to get up
And that was our day to win

You are victims of your own apathy
Victims of passive democracy
Another chance came across
And making a stand against was in your hands

It was the time to get up and shout
To use your vote and to choose the left side
You are victims of your own apathy
Victims of passive democracy",Victims
Rotterdam Ska Jazz Festival,"I went down to Old Joe's Bar
On the corner by the square
All the men were having drinks, same as usual
And the same old crowd was there
Oh, no...

On my left stood my good friend, Joseph McGinley
Oh his eyes were blood-shot and red
And he turned to the people standing by him 
And these are the words he said...

I went down to that St James Infirmary
They had my baby there
She was lying on a long, long white table, yeah
So cold, so still... She was dead
Oh no...

Let her go, let her go, 
God bless her 
Wherever she may be
She can search, search this whole wide world over
But she'll never, find another man as good as me
No she'll never, never find another man
Who'll treat her like I did

Give her all my money, yeah
Never find another man like me
No, she'll never 
Find another man 
Who'll treat her like I did",St. James Infirmary
Rottin Razkals,"Even though we love you
You know we don't have that much time
To really, really, really fuck with you
[Repeat: x2]
Fuck with you

[Fam]
I be cuttin' the fuck up and down
Side to side, all around
All the time, often now (with a raw sound)
Who's the man, damn, fam can jam
Rush, rumble, ram, slam
And kickin' tall cans

[Diesel]
Stop the presses, hold up, stop the damn presses!
I'm next up to flex, mic checks to address this
Feelin, feelin
I got a feelin
Adrenaline, got me tremblin
I got the style
Can't hold it back 'cause I'm too damn wild

Oh hell no, a rugged road rebel flow
Hell yeah - why'know
Same brotha, scarface, braided afro
Outlaw, rottin raskal

[Diesel]
Guess who, the hooligan you hate to see
Yesterday was in your face, but now I'm in your tv
The same nigga from da bricks
Fightin clicks for kicks
I don't care; I really don't give a damn
Smack yo' up and pass you to my swingin fam

[Fam]
Poof, now be gone (ok)
Cause this is how we play every rottin' single holiday

[Chorus: x2]
A-yo, here we go, here we go
Yes, yes y'all, here we go, here we go

[Fam]
A-yo, a-yo, is it so, is it so?
Please tell me no, oh no, no, oh no, no
You claim to be schizophrenic
But practically panic
When me and my clique roll tight and thick
Like the titanic
They should have it banned
Ghetto pass revoked, stands branded
My choke, you couldn't manage
The yolk do too much damage

[Diesel]
Pop goes the diesel
No, never that, don't try and dirty-mac
You rodent, you river rat
Raps counter-react, they counter-attack
You're a tat for tat that's wack
And it bee's like that, black
Feel the vibe, feel the beat
Giving props to KRS-1 for staying true to the ghetto streets

[Chorus: x2]

[Fam]
Here I come, with nothing ever so harder
Niggaz in every hood, welcome my style back like carter
Huh, two times for the hoes
May I exposed to those
My mack daddy ride flows
(flow on then, nigga, hey, don't let me stop ya)
Get in my way an' I'll stop, drop and mop ya
Like that, oh, what ya gonna do now?
Niggas running and ducking, there's a riot going down
But ain't nothing new to my clique or my town
I tell you I'm good with these klickow-klickow

[Diesel]
You have run an over turn
When my lyrics start to burn
Like the chronic in the blunt
And you can't front on the skunk
That's kicking in like jail toes
Who knows what the fuck goes on
You're trying play me, you're dead wrong
So all you silly slipping slouches
I be flipping on ya
Pop the lip, I have my fist steady sticking on ya

Mack on and mack on, ock

That's for my embryo, I did my number cho

What's the problem, Officer? I ain't be did nothin
You on my back sweatin me like I'm some kid frontin
I'm tryin to do my thing, Ingle and Illtown sing
Double I's the thing, if you know what I mean
""What you do for a living, boy?,"" I mean I rock
Not sellin coke on the block, I had to stop
""What's your name?"" - Fam
Damn yo, put a mic in my hand
This is as good as grand
I make you understand how I am
What I stand for and what it's worth
You see my life flash in front of yo face and think it's cursed

[ Diesel ]
I'm the soldier rarely seen from the block of 118
I'm a fanatic, can't help bein a hip-hop fiend
Embedded in my enzymes before I tipped my nine
At birth the world knew I was one of a kind
It's all about the music, that's all I know
That's all I heard growin up in E.O.
But yo, let's not dabble in the past
A look at what the future got in store, so I gotta watch my ass
Can my music be the saviour of my grace?
Cause you see reality written on my face
Just a taste of my flavor make you savor for more
Go from city to city, I check you out on the tour

[ all ]
Is you with me? Oh yeah!
We holdin fort, we ain't goin nowhere	(2x)

[ Fam ]
I gots many, many, huh, concepts, that's much
In clutch grab my nuts, I'm nuts like 'deez nuts'
I got the touch, huh, I take my time when I do mine
It's done when I do mine, for fun when I do mine
It's mine, mine, all mine
The rhyme and the rhythm, I get it from the mind
And put it in the body and soul and then I roll
Steppin on my stroll, I got total control

[ Diesel ]
Hold up, boy, you're ready? Here it comes
Feel the bass from the drums as I expand lyrics from my lungs
I run lyrics so rapid to catch it you need a z
It's me from '19NaughtyIII', the Diesel MC

[ all ]
Is you with me? Oh yeah!
We holdin fort, we ain't goin nowhere	(2x)

[ Fam ]
I said, 'Helloooo, everyboooodyyy'
I said, 'Helloooo, I'm from Ill-t-t-town-t-t-town-t-t-town'
I push the pedal to the metal and just gas on up
Keep a limp in my strut when I walk talkin much
Tell you what, huh, tell me what's really goin on?
Everything's the same, everywhere I go, come on
Go on, so forth and so on, I throw on
A brand new style while I freestyle, me and Lovechild
Reakin, what is it I'm seakin?
I'm always a little tipsy, rip, see, is how I gets busy

[ Diesel ]
Influencing your choice of your listening pleasure
Lyrics are more than a treasure, on wax to remain forever
Clever in my ways, I amaze audiences from the stage
Build up anger, releasin physical rage
Once the spotlight shines it captivated your mind
Eye contacts sendin chills up opponents' spines
This is my place of business, where I'm most relaxed
So many crews stepped up and them fools collapsed

[ all ]
Is you with me? Oh yeah!
We holdin fort, we ain't goin nowhere	(4x)",Oh Yeah

Walking down the corridor

You can hear her stilettos click

High school, a high school confidential

Teenage Brandos stalk her in the halls
They tease her with cat calls
She's a combination Anita Eckberg Mamie van Doren

Dagmar high school confidential

What's the principal doin' with her?
Who's that guy, is he screwing with her?
What's her perfume? Tigress by Fabergé
It makes me cream my jeans
When she's coming my way

Na cama um vazio
Meu coração que se foi
Sem dizer se voltava depois
Sofrimento meu não vou aguentar
Se a mulher que eu nasci pra viver
Não me quer mais

Sempre depois das brigas
Nós nos amamos muito
Dia e noite a sós
O universo era pouco pra nós
O que aconteceu
Pra você partir assim
Se te fiz algo errado, perdão!
Volta pra mim

Essa paixão é meu mundo
Um sentimento profundo
Sonho acordado um segundo
Que você vai ligar

O telefone que toca
Eu digo alô sem resposta
Mas não desliga escuta
O que eu vou te falar

Eu te amo e vou gritar pra todo mundo ouvir
Ter você é meu desejo de viver
Sou menino e teu amor é que me faz crescer
E me entrego corpo e alma pra você

Roupa Nova,"Abriu minha visão o jeito que o amor
Tocando o pé no chão alcança as estrelas
Tem poder de mover as montanhas
Quando quer acontecer
Derruba as barreiras

Para o amor não existem fronteiras
Tem a presa quando quer
Não tem hora de chegar
E não vai embora

Chamou minha atenção
A força do amor
Que é livre pra voar
Durar para sempre

Quer voar
Navegar outros mares
Dá um tempo sem se ver
Mas não se separa

A saudade vem
Quando vê não tem volta
Mesmo quando eu quis morrer
De ciúme de você
Você me fez falta

Sei, não é questão de aceitar
Sim, não sou mais um a negar
A gente não pode impedir
Se a vida cansou de ensinar
Sei que o amor nos dá asas
Mas volta pra casa

Roupa Nova,"Bem lá no céu uma lua existe
Vivendo só no seu mundo triste
O seu olhar sobre a terra lançou
E veio procurando por amor

Então o mar frio e sem carinho
Também cansou de ficar sozinho
Sentiu na pele aquele brilho tocar
E pela lua foi se apaixonar

Luz que banha a noite
E faz o sol adormecer
Mostra como eu amo você

Se a lenda dessa paixão
Faz sorrir ou faz chorar
O coração é quem sabe

Se a lua toca no mar
Ela pode nos tocar
Pra dizer que o amor não se acabe

Se cada um faz a sua história
A nossa pode ser feliz também
Se o coração diz que sim à paixão
Como pode o outro dizer não",A  Lenda [Live]
Rover,"Sign me sign me under your heart
I promise you we'll never be apart

Sue me sue me if I am wrong
We'll spend the next life in my lavender

Take me take me out of this hole
I'm seeing your love lightning my bulb
I see how life has nothing to love
When you're away with problems to solve

Chorus:

You can lay me down
In fields of lavender
The air is light and I can only surrender
Your hair of fire are floating and it's time
For tears and crying to stop for ever

Why me?


Kiss me kiss me please never stop
I'm slowly, slowly touching the clouds

My horses have gone wild in the fog
Your whispers shake the earth and my bones

Help me help me be a new man
I'm weak and smoke runs into my veins

Your power can't be held with two hands
A woman that I won't meet again

You can lay me down
In fields of lavender

Your hair of fire are floating and it's time

Rover,"Since you’re gone I have more fears
Since you’re gone I have more tears
Said I, since you had me on your back
Leaving path along the track

For a day and for a night
I’ve been waiting on my own
Girl I, since the same old situation grows


Sunny days are far away
See my skull’s about to break
You know, I can never see again
Hear my voice it’s still the same

Now that you flew far away
Girl I feel you here with me today
You know, if I ever lost my touch
And if I ever made you cry


Chorus: 

I believe in you
See that’s what I do
I can see you too, love
Anyhow I feel like dust

Poured your rain on sunny songs
Honey please don’t sing along
If you ever loose your faith
Girl, you never worn a crown

Anyhow the winter’s gone
Please don’t call I’m on my own

If you ever need a hand

I had to carry you along",Carry On

But I've got my life and it's all new it's true
There's nothing here for you
Now my days are loaded I've got things to do 
Between money and fame there's no more room for you
The feeling's gone she threw

You
You
You

What can I propose?
Well nothing but my heart and bones
And all this on the phone
I guess the hard times boy you'll be doing them alone!

Refusing shelter from the storm
She closed the door
The page is torned in two
The plans and schemes are too
She says we need some time but we can still be friends 
And when all'll be great we'll drink champagne in coupe
Oh dear I love your suit!

You
You
You

Mirrors and disguise
Brainwashed memories no surprise!
Afraid to catch my eye
With many postponed tickets I'm pushed away goodbye.

Well so long Liz or Baby Lou 
May your friends and mommy never do the same to you
Well they did but now they grew
You said you wiped the stain on the Union Jack
Well the deck is clear no looking back 
Oh Lou...the stain was art in you!

Rover,"Watch the end of the day go down
the beautifull sun is round
the light just spreads in your eyes

Watch above the hill it's dawn
there's nothing I did wrong
I held you tight in the fright


Haven't you seen this coming boy?
Hadn't you heard this trahison sound?


Watch the end of the dayis gone
Leaving you on your own
You're pushed in the sea so strong

Why am I alone to drown?
You're watching me love go down
the fear is straight in your eyes

Why beneath the dark moon sky
water surrounds me now?
You pushed my head for a drown!


Is the moon so high?
Was the moon so high before?
Was the moon so high before?


Cries, melting with deapth I tried
swimming accross the sky
I found no sign of your love

My isn't the sun so bright
replacing the city lights
I wish you'd seek for me now

Was I a threat to starvation?
Was I a break to your nation?

Is the moon so high?
Was the moon so high before?
Was the moon so high before?",Late Night Love
Rover,"Funny how it sounds much better without you
See the noise is gone I'm playing without you

I guess your place for sure was behind a desk,
Dressing dolls for money, here's your success

Thinking that the world could not turn without you
Constipated minds won't make it without you

They should pay me twice to be in your shoes
Bankers, lawyers, honey they won't get the blues

Thinking that you rise? You're on the wrong latter
Sure If it's money-wise, you're Queen of the fools

It gave you a dirty mind, ambitious and cruel
I think you crossed the line, more headaches and jewels

With your tiny heart, you spit on the soup
Sure, you could nail a prophet, 
And then stick to your rules

What's the matter with you? You can't confess?
Too much sins to carry, one more or less!

You are such a sad little girl
You are such a sad little girl",Queen of the Fools
Rover,"Slowly I, slowly I
I drove to your door at night

I want to take you love for a little ride
a drive to the shore

maybe you’ll see what I see

Softly I, softly I
I knocked on your door no light

Say we could take my car for the countryside
A slide through the fog

Oh but you never showed up dear

Ref :
I, I remember the time
I, I remember the time

Silly I, silly I
I melted down and cried, alone

We could’ve settled down on the seaside shore
And carry the time

Only you never showed up dear

Maybe I’m a little boy 
Who needs your help at night
Honey I could be your human toy
Giving you signs of joy

Oh but you never cared for me no

I, I remember the time
I, I remember the time

Could it ever change, my?

Politicians full of lies
The aim for all’s the same

Rover,"My knees are in pain
I’m standing out there in the fog
My heart is in flame
Just a few feet away from your door
I’m guessing your voice
The weigh of your sigh fills the air

Feel I’ve been gone for fourty years
It’s been only four but full of tears
I covered miles to cease the pain
I held your picture in the rain
Expecting you to be the same 
Poems and letters never came

I heard our wedding bells at dawn

Peaked through the window, are you there?
All I could see was my old chair
I whipped the steam, am I insane?
I saw a child beside the fire
His smile was yours, Oh would i dare
Presume the child was mine as well?
Presume the child was mine as well?

I hardly believed this was true
As I had conceived me and you
The ruins of my dream out of the blue
From deep thousand seas to heaven blue

The name on doorbell had been changed 
A man had come to ruin the plan
My expectations are in vain
I stand alone to my old door
If I had known during the war
I’d still be dying in those plains

Now those wedding bells are gone

If I could use a magic spell
I’d be the man beside the child
Resting my soul for heaven sake
I fought for years in heavy shit
Starving to death, loosing my mates
Waiting to see you face to face
Oh I want to see you face to face
Oh…
Oh I want to see you face to face",Wedding Bells

Just do as I say and not as I do

When you whisper softly in my ear

And you just go your way
When I'm left here hoping night and day
Always dreaming
To all we could have been

Is this is what you do to me
Feed me with all the lies you told
No no no
Is this something new to me?
I'll see when the page unfolds
And you will never know

Carry on
You will feel the same one day
Carry on
And it'll hit you in the hardest way
And when it gets you
I will be long gone

Is this is what you do to me
Feed me with all the lies you told
No no no
Is this something new to me?

When I try to hide behind my pride
You're the face that I see
When the past would haunt me till I cry
But true love shadow the pain

Precious moments
Hold me now
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go

A thousand times you stole my heart
A true sign this was planned from the start
Hope God it works in funny ways
(Don't you know that I love you
Don't you know, don't you know that I love you)
Put a smile on my face
Cause I know the best is yet to come
And I remember the place
When you first told me I was the one (yes you did)
And I know that's no mistake

Precious moments
Hold me now
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go

And uh... this love gets deeper as it goes
It saved me from the walk alone
It gave me hope
Love set me free
But if our melody is the same
Then we both will always know
That the feeling will remain

I believe, yes I believe, I believe
I'll never let you go
I'll never let, I'll never let you go

Like you had planned it.
The coldest of hearts seem to fall apart.
Cause everything I see
Has got me thinking

You left at one and now it's half
Past two
Look how you changed me
And why the hell am I calling you baby
It's running of my lips the word escapes me
Lately
And have I now become
Everything I'm not
Or have you made me see
What I always was in reality

Making breakfast in bed
Never see me wanting flowers

Rox,"I'm sitting here and thinking about this messy situation
And how your stupid words have brought us only complications
I should have known when you gave me the eye
You just had your way didn't need to try
And you just had so many words but nothing real to say
And that was something that I found but it was just too late
It seems I only think of you
That's the crazy thing with all you put me through
And

I don't believe
It was me that made the first move
I don't believe
That you did it to me once again
I don't believe
You could leave something so good
What more can I do I leave it up to you

It seems the less you speak
The more I want you here with me
But something funny tells me that ain't how it's gonna be
So I pretend as though I never cared
And forget those times that we both have shared
And you go out your way to break another sorry heart
Like you did to me you planned it from the very start

Ladies listen up, I really hope you're ready
Cause what I've got to say is far from petty
We've come a long way, baby, so maybe
Shanté can help a sister that's way be-
hind, lost in the mind and can't find
Her way to a better day, you know the kind
So wrapped up in fairy tale dreams
So naive that every male seems
Honest and loyal ready, to spoil
Buyin him gifts as if the boy's loyal
But Shanté is here just to say a few things
Some you heard before, but some are new things
So lend me your ears 
Dry up your tears

How many runny-nose kids can you have
How many nights can you work on the ave.
Your so-called man has a car and a Visa
He's livin large while you're livin on pizza
Unemployed while you wait for the perfect mate
Let's get one thing straight cause it's gettin late
What you're waitin for is really never comin 
No one hears the sorry tunes that you're hummin
I'm here to bring the news, that if you're singin the blues
Everyday, it will not change the views
That people have of you, they say you're lost
Nobody forced you to quit, your future's tossed
You put your faith in the guys with the hazel eyes
You thought you would get a prize, all you got was lies
Now you're stuck in a room with a mopping broom
Did you assume that one day you will find a groom?
Are you dizzy, who would ever marry you?
You're lookin for a man that will carry you
And buy you nice things, like diamond rings
You're amazed at the truth that my rhymin brings
But the truth is the only way you'll ever see
That the life that you're hopin for will never be
But the race isn't over, put down the rope
Shanté is here to say there's still hope

So much to live for, she wants to die
Life's full of pitfalls, maybe that's why
Her pops went to jail, her mother tapped her vein
City took custody and trapped her in pain
Feelin so alone in the room with a stranger
Hates her own blood and nothing's gonna change her
Angry at the world cause it doesn't play fair
So much despair does she feel, no one to care
Not a single family member will remember her
Smoke's in her eyes, and the past is a blur
She's on her own now, livin with some other girls
With the same damn lives, but from a different world
These girls are lost, how the city is full of fools
So many years, no guidings, and no kinda rules
No love to give 
Yo, they need love to live
If not instead 
They'll ponder in a bed
Sex is the thing that makes her feel wanted
Love and care, for she's undaunted
Because whoever is laying there won't really matter
Such a sad song when young dreams shatter
I really don't think glue is gonna fix it
But homegirl can walk the right path if she picks it
So lend me your ears 
Dry up your tears
And let's hear the cheers
For the years
Of the independent woman

The black woman role grows larger each day
Nothing in the way so what we teach may
Somehow help those young sisters that doze
And sleepwalk through life with their eyes closed
You don't need a man, all you need is to know you can
Then you can stand on your own two feet and
Achieve anything that you want out of life
Do for yourself, then you can be a wife
And you'll feel so good that you want to shout
Because you got to the top and got there without
Relyin on Tom, Dick, or Billy Dee
You don't have to turn the lights on to really see
So lend me your ears 
Dry up your tears
And let's hear the cheers

Save all the drama
Cause here comes the Big Mama
Any bitch who rip Shanny, I bomb her
Cause y'all weak-ass hoes got me fed up 
So hookers, get your gloves, and yo, let's got head up
Wall to wall y'all all will fall
I don't stall cause in this brawl it's winner takes all
A title bout for all the clout
Any hooker tryin to step to this, it's lights out
One hit, your head split, throat slit
Think you're Miss It, but I started this shit
At 14 years old I was goin gold
While I was on tour, you was tourin the hoe stroll
Suckin dicks and turnin tricks to get a quick fix
While I was puttin dope hits in the mix
Rippin shows with Kane and Biz Markie
Fuckin up Roxanne and takin out Sparky
Niggas came in flocks from blocks and blocks 
To watch the Rox knock bitches out the box
And every place I played, I headlined
Striclty big names on the topic read mine
The q-you-double e-n
Queen of emceein
Whenever I flow it's poetry in
Motion, so you can save all the drama
And get the fuck out the way, here comes the Big Mama

Rhymes are deadly, so hooker, write out your will
Here comes the queen foot-first to your grill
Recitin poems that hit like boulders
Smackin your head dead off your muthafuckin shoulders
So nip all the talk in a bud
This ain't no Game Boy, I came to draw blood
At any hag thinkin that she can last with me 
It only takes one blast, and that ass'll be
Wrecked, ruined, damaged, ripped
Cross my path, your ass'll get whipped
Cause Shanté ain't about no games
Matter of fact, yo, I'ma start callin off names
First up there's Latifah
You roll up, and I'ma smoke that ass like reefer
Cause you ain't never in life been a star to me
Sold the fuck out tryin to go R&B
Now that shit is shady
You say ladies first, well I'm the first lady
And all y'all hoes are phoney
Try to get flippid, I'ma rip you and your girl Monie
You're illegitimate, tryin to get a little bit
And I'm about sick of that 'Monie-in-the-middle'-shit
Your album cold garbage
Had one good jam, now you think you a star, bitch
Breakin your neck tryin to be in the limelight
But give you a mic, and you can't even rhyme right
So get the fuck off the scene
Cause I got a M-16 that says 'Shanny's the queen'
And all you bitches got your style from me
The capital S-h-a-n-t-é
Used to go to my show, analyze how the sound flow
On the down low, fuck around, lay around, hoe

Whenever I come, yo, I come correct
And niggas give me the utmost due respect
And any hag that try to last
'll cold get smoked like marihuana cause her ass is grass
I dig ditches for you bitches
While I collect riches and give you a head full of stitches
Cause in a beef I don't sleep or lollygag
Sendin you hags off-stage in a bodybag
Cause Shanté is a rebel
You say you're lyte as a rock, you get crushed like a pebble
One word, and I'ma bag her
Watch the bitch stagger, cause I don't dig the bulldagger
To me a wush don't deserve a mic in hand
Somebody tell her to stop actin like a man
She needs somethin real thick to help her out quick
(What?) And that's a good piece of dick
Now as for that West Coast slut
With fake-ass hair, contacts, and a patted butt
Instead of stompin to the 90s, use your brain
And stomp your ass down to Jack Lelane
You better hurry and hop on a diet plan
And keep the pork chops out the fryin pan
Yeah, I said it, so what?
You roll up, slut, you get a fuckin gumbut to your gut
I'm bringin tears to all my peers
I ain't new, I been doin this shit for 10 years
Bring any hoe, and I wreck her
I rip the nicest, from Isis down to Salt-N-Pepa
And now you know that I'm the star of the show, hoe 
While I get dough, you're givin up the yo-yo
You say a nigga can't play with it
You got another job? Well bitch, you better stay with it
Cause you ain't shit in this here

They spend a little money, you end up at a hotel

Cold left the dumb bitch somewhere out in Long Island
Next time she'll act decent

Drugs is not the only thing a girl can say no to
You gotta watch every move that you make on the street

That makes him get up in the middle of the night and go 'poof!'

Suck on the thing, and they make you go ""Whoo...""

And for the rest of the night you don't see him no more

A lonely cry a call of the wild.

A dancing daze,
An empty face,
A crystal high a call of the wild.
And there is something that sweeps the dark,

A lover's dart,
The call of a broken heart.
Wrapped in the night,
Behind these eyes,

Oh hear the cry,
A call of the wild.
I know her
And in my mind I dream of her,

How she aches without me.
I know her
And every heart is a lonely hunter
When she walks by.

Oh - can you read the hurt in my eyes?
Oh - don't you leave without saying goodbye.
I got to get through to you.

Another wall",Call of the Wild

Traces from love affairs,
Will never disappear,
Always come thru.

I thought I'd never know
The time to see you go,
Two people turned into one,
Thinking as one.

A hint in the night,
A touch of a dream,
Has come to an end,
We run from one heart to another again.

The rose of our love
Is withered and torn
And gone from one heart to another.
Sailing away to sea,

The ships made of you and me,
They pass in the darkest nights
And turn out the lights.
And I thought I'd never know the season

Being as one.

Goodbye to broken hearts,
Goodbye to romance,
Hiding in the dark,

Nights that leave a scar.
Goodbye to you,
Goodbye to empty cards,
Goodbye to this ball of bliss,

And I fill the bedroom
With silent visions of rain.
And I paint the morning

With echoes from pleasure in pain.
I don't want to touch emotions,
I just got to run away.
Electric blue like oceans,

Wild like lovers sway.
Goodbye to you...
And I seal the pillow
And shatter dreams down the hall.

And I hang the heartache
Like pictures on the wall.

They're playing hurting games?

I was a stranger when I came.

I turn the lights all down,
There's no-one there beside me,

Now's the time for weary minds, the moon is northern bound.

And you know I'm going back, going back today. 
Back to where I came from. 
And you know I'm going back, going back to stay. 
To the alleys where pearls of passion came my way.

There's a promise in the twilight, it's so innocent and wild.

They're swept away and nothing is what is seems,
The feeling of belonging to your dreams.

And there are voices
That want to be heard.
So much to mention
But you can't find the words.
The scent of magic,
The beauty that's been
When love was wilder than the wind.",Listen to Your Heart [Single Mix]

I was a spy, I was captured by the enemies. I made a million selling secret fantasies. I saw my love wasted in a pale grey zone. I was the quake shaking every monument. I had to fi-find out what all the money meant. I checked the sun, I knew that it was time to go go go.

Then came you...",Keep Me Waiting
Roxette,"You build it up and tear it down, there's no reason to follow you. 
You left the song without a sound, you left the story I made for you. 
Softly angels bow and cry in the stillness of the night.

Never is a long time - goodbye. 
No answers for the asking. 
It's a long time - goodbye. 
No mercy for the aching. 
It's a long time - oh I see no light on the forsaken. 
Never is a long time - goodbye. 
Let's spend the night when this dream has come to an end.

Sometimes you laugh, 
Sometimes you cry, and yes, 
I've cried over you. 
You've left me blind in paradise. 
You've left me hungering for the touch of you. 
Snow white angels run and hide in the blackness of the night.

Never is a long time...",Never Is a Long Time
Roxette,"I was raised the northern way
And my father had a northern name,
I did my crying out in the pouring rain.
And a season turned into another one,
I found a heart bright like the morning sun.
He touched my lips, so softly, with his fingertips.

But I kept the rain
Falling down on me
All the time, all the time.
I kept the rain
Falling down on me
All the time, all the time.

And some things in life won't ever change,
There's a smell of a rusty chain
And of love disappearing like an aeroplane.
I've kept the rain
Falling down on me
All the time, all the time.
I've kept the rain
Falling down on me
All the time, all the time, all of the time.",The Rain
Roxette,"I got to get a message through, 
I don't know where we're going. 
I wrap my arms around your naked shoulders, 
take cover for the night. 
I see you in the morning rain, 
oh step inside and lay beside me. 
Tender can you close my eyes and blind me, 
oh give me just a smile... 

Before I fade to silver, 
Silver Blue for you. 
Before I fade to silver, 
Silver Blue for you 

I've turned into The Broken One 
who lost the inspiration. 
I want to give you all my love 
like water to a blood red rose.
The Passion, I can't deal with her. 
The Pain, well I can do without him. 
And this is like the milky way, 
an ocean that only grows and grows 

And babe I fade to silver, 
Silver Blue for you. 
I turn and fade to silver, 
Silver Blue for you 

I wrap my arms around your naked shoulders, 
take cover for the night. 
",Silver Blue
Roxette,"In the coldest time of year,
Darkness all around my heart.
I was alone but didn't fear
To wander in the light of stars.

In the bright and silent night,
Winds would knock and disappear.
Still I felt the feeling near,
Like the first time you were ever here.

You're so far away,
So far away,
You left me,
You told me you would stay.

You never said goodbye
And I'll keep asking why,
I keep on asking how,
Oh come unto me now.

I have breathed the morning air,
I have heard the four winds blow.
I was weary but prepared to follow
Down this lonely road.

In the room where lovers sleep,
Winds would knock and disappear.
Still I felt the music near,
Like the first time we were ever here.

You're so far away,
So far away,
You left me,
You told me you would stay.

You never said goodbye
And I keep wondering why,
I keep on wondering how,
Oh come inside me now.",So Far Away
Roxette,"Lay it down, pull my heart to the ground, 
Time's getting cold now the leaves all turn hard and blue
And I know when I gaze to the sun, no place to hide
I got nowhere to run from you, away from you 

Hold me now, 
girl, I don't know when, 
when we will ever meet again. 
That was then, 
baby, this is now, 
I try to get over you. 
Losing you... 
Things will never be the same. 
Can you hear me call your name? 
If we changed it back again 
things would never be... 

In your hand, 
babe, I don't understand, 
you've got the eyes of a child 
but you hurt like a man 
always do, always do. 
Touch me now, girl, 
I don't when, 
when we will ever meet again. 
That was then,

Roxette,"Can't we leave the world outside
Just for a while? Just for a while? 
And spend some time, you and I,
Under this bright glorious sky.

It's been so long since I first saw you,
But I still love that smile in your eyes. 

Yes it's true, right from the start,
I believed in the church of your heart.
Yes it's you that made me be part of
And believe in the church of your heart.

Step inside, lay yourself down
Just for a while, rest for a while. 
I can hear a thundering sound 
Beating inside when you're around. 

It's been so long since I first met you, 
Since we made love, you know how time flies. 

Yes it's true, right from the start,

Roxette,"You're sliding down a dream, o yea. 
Where nights are born in blue, that's the truth. 
You're swimming in a stream, o yea. 
Fish are jumping too, next to you.

Suddenly you notice someone's at the door, 
You could swear you've been through this all before.

Then she runs her fingertips through your hair. 
Your life has just begun. 
Her fingers, they are everywhere. 
You're floating light like air, 
Leaving the ground and she shines on just like the sun.

You're gazing at the sky, o my. 
The stars are out tonight, shining bright. 
You're waving to a cloud, bye-bye. 
You're drowning in the smile of his eyes. 
Suddenly you feel there's no time for a deal 
Though a voice tells you it's for real.

And she runs her fingertips through your hair and life has just begun. 
Her fingers, there and everywhere. 
You're floating light like air, leaving the ground. 
She-she shines on just like the sun.

It's just a sunny afternoon. 
Somebody's singing songs of love, child. 
You love a lazy afternoon once in a while.",Fingertips
Roxette,"Every shape of every word you say that breaks the silence of an ordinary day. 
Every look that seems to mystify, every single smile that spins me to the sky. 
It makes me want to run, it makes me want to hide. 
'Cause you're the only one that makes me come alive. 
It's getting closer now and darker by the hour.

It only goes to show that here it comes, 
Here comes the weekend and I'm on my own again with a Saturday in the rain. 
Here it comes, here comes the weekend. 
The fine line from pleasure to pain is making me cry. 
When will I see you again?

Every breath, every vision you make. 
Every chance in love you love to take. 
Every move that seems to alter my world. 
Every dream I've had about this boy and this girl. 
It makes me want to run, it makes me want to hide 
'Cause you're the only one that makes my love alive 
And time is running fast into a new goodbye.

It only goes to show that here it comes, 
Here comes the weekend, another walk down that lonely lane, 
Another Sunday that feels the same.

Roxette,"Lay a whisper on my pillow,
leave the winter on the ground.
I wake up lonely, there's air of silence
in the bedroom and all around.

Touch me now, I close my eyes and dream away.

It must have been love but it's over now.
It must have been good but I lost it somehow.
It must have been love but it's over now.
From the moment we touched 'til the time had run out.

Make-believing we're together,
that I'm sheltered by your heart.
But in and outside I've turned to water
like a teardrop in your palm.
And it's a hard winter's day, I dream away.

It must have been love but it's over now,
it was all that I wanted, now I'm living without.
It must have been love but it's over now,
it's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows
it's where the wind blows

It must have been love but it's over now,
it was all that I wanted, now I'm living without.

it's where the water flows...",It Must Have Been Love
Roxette,"In that big big house there are fifty doors 
and one of them leads to your heart. 
In the time of spring I passed your gate 
and tried to make a start. 
All I knew was the scent of sea and dew 
but I've been in love before, 
how about you? 

There's a time for the good in life, 
a time to kill the pain in life, 
dream about the sun you queen of rain 

In that big house there are fifty beds 
and one of them leads to your soul. 
It's a bed of fear, a bed of threats, 
regrets and sheets so cold. 
All I knew your eyes so velvet blue, 
I've been in love before, how about you? 

There's a time for the good in life, 
a time to kill the pain in life, 
dream about the sun you queen of rain 

It's time to place your bets in life,

Roxette,"So you you want to be a rock 'n roll star
Then listen now to what I say
Just get an electric guitar
And take some time and learn how to play
And when your hair's combed right and your pants fit tight
It's gonna be all right

Then it's time to go down town
Where the agent men won't let you down
Sell your soul to the company
Who are waiting there to sell plastic ware
And in a week or two if you make the charts
The girls'll tear you apart

The price you pay for your riches and fame
Was it all a strange game
You're a little insane
The money that came and the public acclaim
Don't forget what you are
You're a rock 'n' roll star",So You Want to Be a Rock & Roll Star
Roxette,"My Papa told me to stay out of trouble:
""When you've found your man, make sure he's for real!"".
I've learned that nothing really lasts forever
I sleep with the scars I wear that won't heal.
They won't heal
Cos everytime I seem to fall in love
Crash! Boom! Bang!
I find the heart but then I hit the wall
Crash! Boom! Bang!
That's the call, that's the game and the pain stays the same.

I'm walking down this empty road to nowhere
I pass by the houses and blocks I once knew.
My Mama told me not to mess with sorrow
But I always did, and Lord, I still do
I'm still breaking the rules

Cos everytime I seem to fall in love
Crash! Boom! Bang!
I find the heart but then I hit the wall
Crash! Boom! Bang!

That's my real middle-name
It has always been the same
That's the call, that's the game and the pain stays the same.
I still feel the heat
And the taste of the kissing
Shattered by rain
And the wild holy war.

And everytime I seem to fall in love
Crash! Boom! Bang!
I find the roses dying on the floor
Crash! Boom! Bang!
That's the call, that's the game and the pain stays the same.

I can't remember her name but I remember her face 'cause her sister looked the same.

They both left school, but they couldn't find a job
So they said farewell and stole a small town car.

As they were riding by the beach some summer night 
The radio shouted out one of those songs that might just change your life 
It went like this: ""Checkin' in checkin' out 
Making love I like watching all your fireworks 
I like it when I light those stars in your eyes 
Just like fireworks in the sky"" 
Yes it did...

Throwing some poems to the ports and docks 
They were sleeping outdoors pushing all their luck.

They sent me a letter full of pills and thrills 
Then they both got rich and moved to Hollywood Hills.

'Cause everywhere the boys went crazy just to hear these words of art: ""Checkin' in checkin' out

I ran a long long way from home
to find a heart that's made out of stone.

I will try,
I just need a little time
to get your face right out of my mind,
to see the world through different eyes

Every time I see you oh I try to hide away
but when we meet it seems I can't let go.
Every time you leave the room
I feel I'm fading like a flower

Tell me why?
When I scream there's no reply,
when I reach out there's nothing to find,
when I sleep I break down and cry

Every time I see you oh I try to hide away
but when we meet it seems I can't let go.
Every time you leave the room
I feel I'm fading like a flower

getting washed by the rain,

And everything I do involves you too. We are like one.

And I don't want to be left out in the rain

I don't want to get hurt, I've done my time.
All I want from you is to tell the truth.
I don't want to get hurt no more this time.
I don't want to go blind and find it's falling apart all the time

In the middle of a dream you are there for me, your face, your lips.
But there's no way you can tell 'cause I hide it really well, so well.
In my life there has been loving and lying
And I don't need another reason to cry

she doesn't live here anymore. 
She's off and she's gone,

Roxette,"Everywhere I look I see her smile
Her absent-minded eyes
And she has kept me wondering for so long
How this thing could go wrong. 

It seems to me that we are both the same
Playing the same game
But as darkness falls this true love falls apart
Into a riddle of her heart. 

[Chorus]
She's so vulnerable, like china in my hands
She's so vulnerable and I don't understand
I could never hurt the one I love
She's all I've got
But she's so vulnerable
Oh so vulnerable. 

Days like these no one should be alone
No heart should hide away
Her touch is gently conquering my mind
There's nothing words can say. 

She's colored all the secrets of my soul
I've whispered all my dreams
But just as nighttime falls this vision falls apart
Into a riddle of her heart, yea.

Roxette,"Cooper went out late last night
I heard the slam from her door
Foggy ways, november daze
All the white wolves were smiling
Cooper went out walkin' the clouds
She left everything in a mess

And there's a sound from the telephone
When can I say she's coming home?
Leave me the number you're dialing from
And may I ask who's calling?
May I ask who's calling?

I heard the bells from the church
Someone said they saw a car
Picking her up by the stations
Cooper went out and that's all there is

Watching cars upon the hill

For just a moment time stood still

Wouldn't you? 

Well, it's a long long journey to the other side

To salvation square? 

It's a long long winter 'til the birds will sing 
Oh I'll be waitin' all night for the phone to ring
I'm goin' up in smoke and phoney magazines 
Everything is just pieces of my stupid dreams 
Everything is just spieces of my stupid dreams 

With the clouds passin' by 
With the clouds passin' by

7twenty7 is close to the sky 
It carries the world 
Between hello and goodbye 
Like the Monday we met 
That disappeared in a breath 
Like the Sunday she left 
Forever smellin' of death 

Another jet black night, another drink to go 
Oh I'll be diving my head in the pure white snow

Tell me, will I ever see her again",7Twenty7 [#][Demo Version]

She turned her head much better off on her own.

I died, shoelace untied she looked in my eyes, small and surprised.
And God closed every gaze the moon fell into the lake.
Boy, she's gone, a drift she's better off on her own.
She closed, then she left much better off on her own.

Pushing all their luck
They sent me a letter
Full of pills and thrills

And moved to Hollywood hills

Roxette,"In that big big house, there are fifty doors
And one of them leads to your heart
In the time of spring I passed your gate
And tried to make a start

But I've been in love before, how about you?

There's a time for the good in life
A time to kill the pain in life
Dream about the sun
You queen of rain

In that big old house there are fifty beds
And one of them leads to your soul
It's a bed of fear, a bed of threats
Regrets and sheets so cold

All I knew your eyes so velvet blue
I've been in love before, how about you?

There's a time for the good in life
A time to kill the pain in life

Baby, sometimes I feel like dying
Driving while I'm closing my eyes
Moving in and out of hiding
Trying to catch some thruth in my life
Wathing your stars and your moonlight
Come tumbling down from the sky
Take it now.

I'm gonna run to you
I'm gonna come to you
I wanna find you
In everything that I do
I'm gonna run to you

I'm gonna follow

Sunday morning my town is sleeping
Lying all alone in my bed
There's not a sound, I can't help but listening
Wishing I was somewhere else instead
But sometimes they are too hard to handle
Those voices inside my head
Listen now.

Take a walk inside my dream: A church, a lonely road
All the people come and go and come and go.
I'm gonna run to you
I'm gonna come to you
Do it now!

Roxette,"Have you ever had the feeling
You take it all for granted
You wake up every morning
And expect to rise
Have you ever had a moment
To look into the mirror
To find a person
Who won't open her eyes
Have you ever felt a presence
(Or is it all in the past, dear?)
So mesmerizing
It chills you to the bone
Have you ever been in love
And overcome that first fear
Well, then you know
No one makes it on her own

Did you ever catch a sunset
Right across the ocean
The universe revealed
And it didn't make sense at all
When you came into my world
Causing quite a commotion
I could have sworn I've met you
Many times before
Cos there's something in your eyes
That links us together
Something 'bout your face your lips
Your smile looks so alone
Have you ever been in love
And thought it'd last forever
Well, then you know
No one makes it on her own

Only when I dream

To everyday there's a history
To every love that's lost there is tragedy
I saved the vision of you in my head
I watched a new universe being born raised in breath
In the calm of my bed

Some might say it's over now
I don't believe them
If I only got to you
I'd prove them right

(Only when I dream) I hear you, I'm near you
I hold you close to me
(Only when I dream) I touched you and I breath you
I feel you deep inside me

Things were never easy for me
And the temple we built stayed sacred and free
I came looking for more self-esteem
All I found was your voice on the answering machine
Simple and clear

There's no escape for the broken-hearted
There's no return once you've lost your way

Roxx Gang,"Drivin' down the fast lane late one night
I saw somethin' in my mirror comin up on the right
A fire red roadster pulled next to my ride
It was too dark to see the driver inside
I heard a voice though I couldn't see the face
And it asked me if I wanted to race
Then he lit a cigarette and by the light I could see
I was talkin' to the Devil, he was talkin' to me 

Race with the Devil, if you lose
You gotta pay the Devil his dues
Race with the Devil, live to tell
One foot on the gas and the other in Hell! 

The Devil looked at me with an evil smile
He said, ""We're racin' for your soul this next quarter mile""
I said, ""Listen Old Nick, I'll take that bet""
I said, ""I take all comers and I haven't lost yet!""
He said, ""If you win, you can choose your game
But if you lose, boy, I've got your name!""
I revved my engine and dropped into gear
My rod was runnin' on nitro, I was runnin' on fear 

Race with the Devil, if you lose
You gotta pay the Devil his dues
Race with the Devil, live to tell
One foot on the gas and the other in Hell!

I'm racin', racin' with the Devil
I got my pedal to the metal
One slip now could be fatal
'Cause I'm racin', racin' with the Devil 

The smell of burning rubber filled the air
I was racin' for my life without a second to spare
I gripped that stick and my knuckles turned white
He's not takin' my soul, not without a fight
I got a bad, bad motor sitting under my wheels
So to hell with the Devil and his deals
I put the pedal to the metal and I blew right by

Too many times beautiful
Too many times sad
Too many times wonderful

We walked together in moonlight and looked down over the calm lake,
Hand in hand, the stars in our eyes.""

Saved from yesterday

Roxy Music,"Here the soil is barren
Here, nothing grows
But crosses
They, know not what they do
You, your forgiveness
Falls as dew
Nailed upon a wooden frame
Twisted yet unbroken
Open mounted a silent choir
Understood, unspoken
Never was there heard a sound
Until the heavens opened
Now the tide is turning
To other-wordly yearning
Through the sun's eclipse seems final
Surely he will rise again",Triptych
Roxy Music,"Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, where have you been, my darling young one?
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin',
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin',
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin',
Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin',
Heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin',
Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin',
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

Oh, who did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
I met another man who was wounded with hatred,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

Oh, what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, what'll you do now, my darling young one?
I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin',
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison,
Where the executioner's face is always well hidden,
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
And I'll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it,
And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it,
Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin',
But I'll know my song well before I start singin',
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.",A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall

Roxy Music,"Yesterday, well it seemed so cool
When I walked you home, kissed goodnight
I said ""it's love"" you said ""all right""
It's funny how I could never cry
Until tonight and you pass by
Hand in hand with another guy
You're dressed to kill and guess who's dying?
Dance away the heartache
Dance away the tears
Dance away

Loneliness is a crowded room
Full of open hearts turned to stone
All together all alone
All at once my whole world had changed
Now I'm in the dark, off the wall
Let the strobe light up them all
I close my eyes and dance till dawn
Dance away

Now I know I must walk the line
Until I find an open door
There was I, many times a fool
I hope and pray, but not too much
Out of reach is out of touch
All the way is far enough

In our present state
Part false part true

All over your shoulder

There all night lying
With your dark horse hiding
Abhorring such extremes

You're rubbing shoulders
With the stars at night
Shining so bright
Getting older
But you'll wake up soon
And fight
In the morning
Things you worried about
Last night
Will seem lighter
I hope things
Will turn out right

To rock you till the grave

For those who dare because it's there
I know I've seen

I've studied marble flaws
And faces drawn pale and worn
By many tears

I am that I am from out of nowhere
To fight without a cause

For the whole world

Beats the plastic you

Exposed and another

In a looking glass world
Is pretty hard for you

Faced with silk
Softly stuffed eider down

Take refuge in pleasure
Just give me your future
We'll forget your past

Roy Acuff,"How many times have you heard someone say
If I had his money I would do things my way?
But little they know that's so hard to find
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind

Once I was willing in fortune and fame
Everything that I dreamed for to get a start in life's game
But suddenly it happened, I lost every dime
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind

Money can't buy back your youth when you're old
Or a friend when you're lonely or a love that's grown cold
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind

When life has ended, my time has run out
My friends and my loved ones, I'll leave there's no doubt
But one thing for certain when it comes my time
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind

Is one with the great church of God.

They hate her because she is chosen
And has not denied Jesus' name.

They watch every move that she makes
They long to find fault with her teachings
But really they find no mistake.

She's going to leave by and by
When the trumpet shall sound in the morning
She'll rise and go up in the sky.

In the presence of all her despisers
With a song never uttered before
She will rise and be gone in a moment
Till the great tribulation is o'er.

I am proud that my name is on her book
For I want to be one never fearing

Roy Acuff,"We live in two different worlds, dear, that's why we're so far apart
You made the world out of vows that are broken
I built the world in my heart
Everyone here tried to warn me, you were just playing a game
I told them all we were meant for each other
I thought our worlds were the same

If you stay over in your world, oh, how my poor heart will pine
Darling, one day when your memories wander
Won't you come over to mine?
We live in two different worlds, dear, my world is honest and true
Sweetheart, remember when your world gets lonely
I'll still be waiting for you",We Live in Two Different Worlds
Roy Acuff,"When was the last time
You got up before the sun
And watched while the night and day
Melted into one?

When was the last time
You really looked at rain
Dripping down the gutter
Splashing on the window-pane?

My fondest memories
Are tied around these things
Sunday school, bedtime rules
Grandma's squeaky swing

Sneaking out behind the barn
My love would meet me there
Tripping in the hallway
Over Grandpa's rocking chair

Back in the country
Now I know you're gonna say
Back in the country
Don't you wish that you had stayed

Back in the country
Where the roses still grow wild
Back in the country
Where you walked those country miles

When was the last time
You saw sundown through a tree
Sitting on the front porch
In a cool evenin' breeze

When was the last time
That you heard a Bobwhite song
When was the last time
I'll bet it's been too long

In which you said you'd wait for me
I'm asking you to please not wait, dear
It will only ruin your life I see

Please don't wait for me, darling
We could never be happy I know
I'll always be an ex convict
And branded wherever I go

In three years my sentence is over

The warden will say I'm a free man
But my name will never be free

Please don't wait for me, darling
We could never be happy I know

Roy Acuff,"There were no loved one to weep over her
Not a tear did I see shed
For the lady they pulled from that muddy old river
No one ever came to claim their dead

She lay on the cold marble slab at the marque
Thousands viewed her but none knew her name
They will lay her to rest in Potter's Field tomorrow
She will lay there unloved and unclaimed

Inside the purse that she clutched in her hand
A note written, 'Blame no one but me'
As I looked in her faced I couldn't help but think
What a poor wicked place this world can be",Unloved and Unclaimed
Roy Acuff,"Some people are just like an automobile
They'll run fine when every thing is right
When the roads are all clear and the weather is fine
And there's plenty of sunshine and light

But often they come to a wash out
And then get stuck and have to detour
Maybe a break in the casting will prove
They never were built to endure

Get plenty of water and plenty of oil
And the best gasoline you can find
Have the engine tuned up and look out for your breaks
You'll have some hard places to climb

Look out for the tires for the blowouts will come
On a dangerous curve deep and neigh
But if you'll let Jesus take hold of the wheel
You'll make it to heaven on high

Some auto's are painted and polished so bright
They sell for more than they are worth
And some people think their profession
Will do stop short of the bibles new birth

Just start up your engine and then
You can tell if the thing is hitting on six
For if you depend on the looks of the car
You'll be in a terrible fix

Now all our profession's of powder and paint
Though lovely upon the outside
Won't answer to God for He looks on the heart
It matters not how hard we've tried

So if you are stuck in the quicksand of sin
And wondering and floundering about
Just let God's great engine of glory and grace
With a cable of love pull you out

Get plenty of water and plenty of oil
And the best gasoline you can find
Have the engine tuned up and look out for your breaks
You'll have some hard places to climb

Look out for the tires for the blowouts will come
On a dangerous curve deep and neigh
But if you'll let Jesus take hold of the wheel

Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Child of the night, down and forlorn
Still I took you in, it's in the stars above
All girls are made the same, they all need a little love 
And the magic of the moment
Exploded with desire
When the time is right, the sparks ignite
And set the night on fire 

It's chain lightnin', too hot to fight
Hot on the heels of a Saturday night
Chain lightnin', out of control
Straight to the heart and down to your soul
Chain lightnin', heavens above
Another day older, still searching for love
Chain lightnin, too hot to fight
And it's hotter than hell, in the heavens tonight 

I was livin' hard, I was feelin' down and lonely
When toward the boulevard, a limousine moved slowly
And I noticed in the back seat, a lady wrapped in fur
Her eyes burned through me, and mine stared back at her 
And I recognized the moment
As I opened up her door
I knew I would regret it
I've been burned before 

It's chain lightnin', too hot to fight
Hot on the heels of a Saturday night
Chain lightnin', out of control
Straight to the heart and down to your soul
Chain lightnin', heavens above
Another day older, still searching for love
Chain lightnin, too hot to fight
And it's hotter than hell, in the heavens tonight 

And lord it's so hot when the chain reaction
Is set off with a kiss
And it's so tough when the satisfaction
Is greater than the risk
When you look in her eyes and you realize
This time you can't resist

It's chain lightnin' 
And the magic of the moment
Exploded with desire
When the time is right the sparks ignite
And set the night on fire 
It's chain lightnin', too hot to fight
Hot on the heels of a Saturday night

Chain lightnin', out of control
Straight to the heart and down to your soul
Chain lightnin', heavens above

Roy Ayers,"Through early morning fog I see
Visions of the things to be
The pains that are withheld for me
I realize and I can see

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
I can take or leave it if I please

That game of life is hard to play
I'm gonna lose it anyway
The losing card of some delay
So this is all I have to say

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
I can take or leave it if I please

The sword of time will pierce our skin
It doesn't hurt when it begins
But as it works it's way on in
The pain grows stronger, watch it burn

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I please

A brave man once requested me
To answer questions that are key
Is it to be or not to be
And I replied, ""Oh why ask me?""

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
I can take or leave it if I please

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And you can do the same thing if you please

Roy Black,"Alle ihre Freunde sagten ihr:
Laá die Finger weg, er taugt nicht viel!
Aber sie hat ihm allein vertraut
Und für ihn war alles nur ein Spiel.
Als er sie dann sitzen lieá
Traf sie's wie ein Schlag
Sie tat mir schon lange leid
Und ich hab' ihr gesagt:
Es war nur Sand in deinen Augen
Das wird vergehen
Und do wirst sehen
Wie gut ich's meine.
Es war nur Sand in deinen Augen
Erst gibt es Tränen
Dann ist dein Blick wieder klar und frei.
Viele Tage lang verkroch sie sich
Nicht mal Freunde durften bei ihr sein.
Sie ging nicht einmal ans Telefon
Und sie sperrte sich I'm Zimmer ein.
Doch ich klopfte an der Tür
Meine Angst war so groá
Ganz verzweifelt kam sie 'raus
Und ich sagte ihr bloá:
Es war nur Sand in deinen Augen
. . .
Da nahm ich sie mit zu mir nach Haus
Und war Tag und Nacht für sie nur da
Immer wieder sprachen wir uns aus
Und wir kamen uns einander nah.
Und an unserm schönsten Tag
Lachte sie mit mir
Dann brach sie in Tränen aus
Doch ich sagte zu ihr:
Es war nur Sand in deinen Augen
. . .
Mit meiner Liebe ist deine traurige Zeit vorbei.

Roy Black,"Ganz unerwuenscht, so kam er zur Welt. 
 Und er hat nie fuer irgendwen gezaehlt. 
 Bald streunte er herum, war ganz auf sich gestellt. 
 Er konnte nicht waehlen und fing an zu stehlen 
 mal irgendwann. 
 Und jemand bot ihm Geld. Und dafuer mußte er dann 
 fuer ihn die Kohlen aus dem Feuer holen. 
 Ja, so fing's an... 
 Lucky, do hast I'm Leben niemals Glueck gehabt. 
 Lucky, do hattest niemals eine Chance, ohoho. 
 Lucky, do hattest niemand, der die Hand Dir gab. 
 Lucky, do lebst ganz umsonst. 
 Die Unterwelt, die zog ihn herab. 
 Er tat fuer Geld jeden Job ,den es gab. 
 In einer dunklen Nacht, da kam das große Ding. 
 Er hoerte Sirenen und konnte nicht fliehen. 
 Er war umstellt. 
 Doch er ergab sich nicht. Und man schoß auf ihn. 
 Die letzten Secunden, die sah er wie Stunden 
 Vorueber zieh'n ... 
 Lucky, do hast I'm Leben niemals Glueck gehabt. 
 Lucky, do hattest niemals eine Chance, ohoho.

Lang war mein Flug durch die endlose Nacht.
Sie sieht mich an und sie lacht mir zu
Sie ist wie do California Blue.
California Blue dieser Traum stirbt nie
Er lebt tief in mir noch als Fantasie
Wenn die Sonne sinkt
Bin ich nah bei dir
Mach die Augen zu

Nur einmal noch San Franzisco sehn
Und irgendwann word' ich nie mehr gehn
Denn mein Traum bist do

Kein Diamant der vom Himmel fällt
Hat so wie do alle Farben der Welt
Ein letztes Mal kam der Morgen am Meer
So leuchtend wie do

Roy Brooks,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?

The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now
Roy Brown,"Now, just because you're pretty and you think you're mighty wise
You tell me that you love me, then you roll those big brown eyes

Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me
I can see you've been out on a spree
Well, it's plain that you're lyin'
When you tell me you been cryin'
Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me

I used to spend my money just to make you look real sweet
I wanted to be proud of you when we walk down the street
Now don't ask me to dress you up in a satins and in silk
Your eyes look like two cherries in a glass of buttermilk

Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me
I can see you've been out on a spree

It's plain that you're lyin'
When you tell you've been cryin'
Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me

Now, I guess our little romance has finally simmered down
You should join a circus, man, you'd make a real good clown
Your eyes look like a road map, I'm scared to smell your breath
You'd better shut those peepers 'fore you bleed yourself to death

About a guy named Butcher Pete
Oh, Pete just flew into this town
And he's choppin' up all the women's meat

He's hackin' and wackin' and smackin'
He's hackin' and wackin' and smackin'
He's hackin' and wackin' and smackin'
He just hacks, wacks, choppin' that meat

Butcher Pete's got a long sharp knife
He starts choppin' and don't know when to stop
All you fellows gotta watch your wifes
'Cause Pete don't care who's meat he chops

Ever since Peter flew into town
He's been havin' a ball
Just cuttin' and choppin' for miles around
Single women, married women, old maids and all

Wakes up in the morning, half past five
Chops from sunrise to sunset
I don't see how he stays alive
Meat's gonna be the death of ole Pete, yeah

The police put Pete in jail
Yes, he finally met his faith
But when they came to pay his bail
They found him choppin' up his cell mate

That Butcher Pete is a crazy man
Tries to chop down the wind and the rain
Just hacks on anything he can get
Say, turn this record over, you ain't heard nothing yet","Butcher Pete, Pt. 1"
Roy Brown,"Well, they let ole Pete out of the jail
He went back to his store
All the women who payed his bail
Were waitin' on Pete to chop some more

There's an old woman, who's ninety-two
Lives down the street
She said, one thing more I wanna do
Is find ole Pete and let him chop my meat

Pete went to church one Sunday night
He gave the preacher a fit
That crazy Pete started a fight
When he went hackin' on the pulpit

Well, they put him in jail again
They tried to give him life
Pete beat the case, he pleaded insane
They gave him back his same ole knife

Well, he got out of jail on Sunday night
Monday he tightened his grip
He started to China to see the sites
Went nuts again and chopped up the ship

Brought ole Pete back to town
To electrocute him there
But Pete was crazy like a clown
He chopped down that electric chair

He's a maniac!
He don't do nothin' but hackin'","Butcher Pete, Pt. 2"

Roy Buchanan,"She didn't bat an eye, as I packed my bags to leave
I thought she would cry, or sit around my room and grieve
But oh the girl she fooled me this time
Acting like I was the last thing on her mind 
Now I'd like to start all over again
I just want to change my mind

As I took those steps, toward that open door
Knowing all the time, oh Lord I just didn't wanna go
She didn't give me no sign
Nothing that would make me wanna change my mind
And I would like to start all over again
Baby, can I change my mind
'Cause I would like to change my mind

You know, I was confused, sitting here by myself thinking
watching you walk to the door and walk away
what was I supposed to say change your mind

Oh I've played my game so many times before
But people let me tell y'all, that I never reached the door
Oh the wind it is high tonight 
I keep lookin' for my baby but she's not in sight 
And I would like to start all over again

Baby can I change my mind
'Cause I would like to start all over again
Baby can I change my, my mind
'Cause I would like to start all over again with you girl",Can I Change My Mind
Roy Buchanan,"By Mary McCreary

I've been working so hard,
Just came home from my job.
Looked down in my wallet,
Good God, I've been robbed.


Now where can my money be,
All my hard-earned pay?
What am I going to do now?
I got my bills to pay.


You got me singin' the blues,
And I'm paying all my dues.
You got me singin' the blues,
Ain't got nothing to lose.


I got to tell you I got the blues down in my pockets.
People, what did I say?
Bills are gonna rob me tomorrow,
Why I need my ten dollars today.


Chorus

Ain't no way to get even
Because, you know what I mean,
Every time I make me some money
Somebody's going to take it from me.

I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,

And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.

When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,

I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,

Yes this is my country.
Young and growing. 
Free and flowing. See to see.

I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

Johnny he vowed he would leave her
Said he was goin' away

Cried ""Oh Johnny, please stay""
She says, ""My honey I have done you wrong
But please don't go away""

And to his Frankie cried:

Every dollar I can save, dear
I'm goin' to give to you
So I think now, dear
That ought to keep you here""
Johnny says, ""Listen now Frankie

""Say man, your hour has come""
From underneath her silk kimono
She drew a forty-four gun
Oh, it was bear, 'twas quite a large affair
Johnny he dashed down the stairway
Cryin' ""Oh Frankie, don't shoot""
Frankie took aim with her forty-four
Five times with a rooty-toot-toot
As Johnny fell, then miss Frankie yelled:

Roy Clark,"Twilight falls, 
Evening shadows find,
There 'neath the stars a maiden so fair divine.

The moon on high seemed to see her there,
In her eyes was a light shining ever so bright,
As she whisper'd a silent pray'r.

Ev'ry word revealed an empty, broken heart;
Broken by fate that holds them so far apart.

Lonely there she kneels, and tells the stars above,
In her arms he belongs, then her pray'r is a song,
Her unending song of love.",A Maiden's Prayer

Roy Clark,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me

Roy Clark,"The alarm rang at seven this morning
The same time it did yesterday
Seven-thirty is my breakfast time
And I know what the wife?s gonna say

The Crawfords next door got a new swimming pool
The Millers got a color TV
Mr. Wilson's job is not good as yours,
But his wife dresses better than me

I get to the school at eight o-five
And drop off the kids at the gate
Then I drive past the clock outside the bank
It's exactly a quarter past eight

When I reach the stop sign at Oak Street
The same thought crosses my mind
Should I turn right like I always have,
Or left and leave it behind?

Right or left at Oak Street
That's the choice I face everyday
And I don't know which takes more courage
The staying or the running away

A left turn would take me to somewhere
Leave alarm clocks and schedules behind
And the world wouldn't care if I'm not somewhere
At some particular time

Where a man can do what he wants to do
And no one expects him to give
All of his time to the same old routine
In the one life that he has to live

I'm not sure which way is the best way
But I've always turned right before
And it might be strange at the end of the day
If they weren't there at the door

A man must make his decisions
But he must consider the stakes
For every mans life is a gamble
It depends on the turn that he takes

Right or left at Oak Street
That's the choice I face everyday
And I don't know which takes more courage
The staying or the running away",Right or Left at Oak Street

Roy Clark,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday

And there's nothing short of dying

Roy Clark,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth make a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

Oh, it's a long long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
And you ain't got time for waiting game

When days dwindle down to a precious few
September November,
And these few golden days I'd share with you
Those golden days I share with you

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few

And these few precious days I'll spend with you

Roy Clark,"Yesterday when I was young
The taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue.
I teased at life as if it were a foolish g ame,
The way the evening breeze may tease a candle fl ame.
The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned
I always built alas on weak and shifting sand.
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of the day
And only now I see how the years ran away.

Yesterday when I was young
So many drinking songs were waiting to be sung,
So many wayward pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see.
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out,
I never stopped to think what life was all about
And every conversation I can now recall
Concerned itself with me and nothing else at all.

Yesterday the moon was blue
And every crazy day brought something new to do.
I used my magic age as if itwere a wand
And never saw the waste and emptiness beyond.
The g ame of love I played with arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit too quickly quickly died.

The friedns I made all seemed somehow to drift away
And only I am left on stage to end the play.
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung,
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue.

Roy Drusky,"Last night all alone in a barroom met a girl with a drink in her hand
She had ruby red lips coal black hair and eyes that would tempt any man
Then she came and sat down at my table and as she placed her soft hands in mine
I found myself wanting to kiss her for temptation was flowing like wine
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside

Then we danced and she whispered I need you take me away from here and be my man
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it the reflection of my wedding band
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home",Almost Persuaded
Roy Drusky,"Look into my teardrops and darling, you will see
The reflection of an angel that made a fool of me
Look into my teardrops and you will see the eyes
That promised me so many things but all of them were lies

Look into my teardrops in the mirror of my soul
And you will see the girl who stilled my only world, but I couldn't hold
Look into my teardrops and you will see the one
That broke my heart forever, aren't you proud of what you've done?

Look into my teardrops in the mirror of my soul

Roy Drusky,"I've tried to tell myself it's not important you fell in love so many times before
But I won't be back to be another number there are too many footprints on your floor
Too many footprints on your floor and some of them were bigger shoes than mine
How many others have you kissed goodnight at your front door
There are too many footprints on your floor

I'm gonna stand where no one's stood before

Missing you since you left me behind I've got too much of you still on my mind

And we couldn't be close though we tried
We both reached for heavens but ours weren't the same

My world could never fit in, I wish it could
Two hearts lie in shambles and oh, they've cried

I can tell by the way you hold me darling that it won't be long before it's crying time

Roy Drusky,"A rainbow always shows up when the storm is through
To decorate a fresh green world where life can start anew
Then the roses show their glory and the sun comes shining through
But there's no rainbows nor no roses in my stormy world with you
Oh I know I'd see the rainbows and the roses
If the storm that's raging in our world would end
Why can't we be happy like we used to
And bring the rainbows and the roses back again

I don't know what happened to the love we knew
I wouldn't care what happen now if I knew what to do

And bring the rainbows and the roses back again

I've hungered for your touch

Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea
To the waiting arms of the sea
Lonely mountains cry, wait for me, wait for me

Might dim the view for me

My friend I'll say it clear I'll state my case of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full I've traveled each and every highway
And more much more than this I did it my way
Regrets I've had a few but then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption

I've planned each chartered course each careful step along the byway
And more much more than this I did it my way
I've loved I've laughed and cried I've had my fill my share of losing
And now as tears subside I find it all so amusing

Roy Drusky,"Once upon a time there was a tavern where we used to raise a glass or two
Remember how we laughed away the hours
And dream of all the great things we would do
Those were the days my friend we thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we chose we'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way
Then the busy years went rushing by us we lost our starry notions on the way
If by chance I'd see you in the tavern we'd smile at one another and we'd say
Those were the days my friend we thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we chose we'd fight and never lose
Those were the days oh yes those were the days
Just tonight I stood before the tavern nothing seemed the way it used to be
In the glass I saw a strange reflection was that lonely woman really me
Those were the days my friend...
Through the door there came familiar laughter
I saw your face and heard you call my name
Oh my friend we're older but no wiser for in our hearts our dreams are still the same

And thinks of the young man that she almost married
What would he think if he saw her this way

Then slowly starts dancing remembering her girlhood
And all of the boys she had waiting in line
Ah such are the dreams of the everyday housewife
You see everywhere anytime of the day
Like the everyday housewife that gave up the good time for me

The photograph album she takes from the closet and slowly turns the first page
And carefully picks up the crumbling flower
The first one he gave her now withered with age
She closes her eyes and touches the housedress that suddenly disappears

With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like

Waitin' patient by the China berry tree
With her feet already dusty from the pathway to the levee
And her little blue jeans rolled up to her knees
And I'd paid her no attention as she tagged along beside me
Trying hard to copy everything I did
But I couldn't keep from smiling when I'd hear somebody saying
Looky yonder there goes Jody and the kid
Even after we grew older we could still be seen together
As we walked along the levee holding hands
For as surely as the seasons she was changing to a woman
And I'd lived enough to call myself a man
And she often lay beside me in the coolness of the evening
Till the morning sun was shining on my bed
And at times when she was sleeping I would smile when I'd remember

How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:

Finding another world.

We recall them in days after

Roy Eldridge,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

Roy Eldridge,"Perdido,
I look for my heart
It`s perdido
I lost it way down in Torito
The day the fiesta started

Bolero,
I sway that they play the Bolero
I kissed me the listing sombrero
And that`s when my heart departed

High, was the sun when I held him close
Low, was the moon when we said, ""Adios""

And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep

To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

A moment of bliss we spent

As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

'Till now we have never been told
The old question's answered by one that is new
What is so rare, dear, as you?
 
So rare, you're like the fragrance of blossoms fair
Sweet as a breath of air
Fresh with the morning dew
So rare You're like the sparkle of old champagne
Orchids in cellophane 
Couldn't compare to you 
You are perfection you're my idea 
Of angels singing the Ave Maria
For you're an angel, I breathe and live you
With every beat of the heart that I give you 
So rare, This is a heaven on earth we share
Caring the way we care
Ours is a love so rare
 
So rare, You have the warmth of a Schubert air
Charming and debonaire
Those are the words for you
So rare You have a way that's beyond compare
That ""one in a million"" air
In everything you do
You have that something, that certain manner
You thrill me more than the ""Star Spangled Banner""
You stage a love scene, so sweetly tender
And in that love scene I gladly surrender
So rare, to have a future like yours to share
Sweetheart the way we care

Roy Fox,"Thanks for the memory
Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles
When the preacher said
For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

We who could laugh over big things
Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Thanks for the memory
Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Strictly entire nous,
Darling, how are you?
And how are all
Those little dreams
That never did come true?

Awfully glad I met you,
Cheerio and toodle-oo
Thank you,
Thank you so much.",Thanks for the Memory
Roy Fox,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things

Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,

Broken, beaten, sick at heart

We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all

Roy Harper,"Not talkin' 'bout a year
No not three or four
I don't want that kind of forever
In my life anymore
Forever always seems
To be around when it begins
But forever never seems
To be around when it ends
So give me your forever
Please your forever
Not a day less will do, from you

People spend so much time
Every single day
Runnin' 'round all over town
Givin' their forever away
But no not me, I won't let my forever roam
And now I hope I can find my forever home
So give me your forever
Please your forever
Not a day less will do, from you

Like a hand-less clock with numbers
An infinite of time
No not the forever found
Only in the mind
Forever always seems
To be around when things begin
But forever never seems
To be around when things end
So give me your forever
Please your forever
Not a day less will do

Roy Harper,"I once held a lantern of love in my hands.
She was all I could see.
Kicking the brown leaves of childhood around us.
We danced the deep sea,
That welled from the spring of the boy that I was;
Held in her flame.
Feeling her learning.
Watching her burning.
To see the first man I became,
Little lady,
Who made me.
Was it you,
Or is it that old unforgiveness
That I can't forget?
I was her warchild, and she was my wildcat.
We lived in a dream.
Broke up for summer, unfolding the secret,
And woke up downstream,
Facing the current that said that we couldn't
Go on.
Tearing the seed out
With sharp tongues,
And no doubt,
Before it was born,
Little lady, etcetera.
Sometimes I cry in the flood of my guts.
Laughing in sadness.
Bursting with rage in the wounds of revenge.
Bleeding forgiveness.
It isn't you, love, or anything new
I just tasted.
It's myself standing...
Standing, watching me
Getting hung up,
Spaced, and wasted,
Little lady, etcetera.",Little Lady
Roy Harper,"The kettle's on, the sun has gone
Another day
She offers me Tibetan tea on a flower tray
She's at the door, she wants to score
She dearly needs to say

I loved you a long time ago
Where the winds own forget-me-nots blow
But I just couldn.t let myself go
Not knowing what on earth there was to know.

But I wish that I had 'cause I need you so bad
I should have had one of your children.

And across the room inside a tomb
A chance is waxed and wanes
The night is young, why are we so hung up
In each others chains
I must make her, I must take her
While the dove domains

and feel the juice run as she flies
Run my winds under her sighs
As the flames of eternity rise
To lick us with the first born lash of dawn.

Oh really my dear I can't see what we fear
Sat here with ourselves in between us.

And at the door she can't say more
Than just another day
And without a sound
I turn around
And I walk away.",Another Day
Roy Harper,"Plastic money flexidream
And comfort for the preacher
Keep the debtor out of prison
Borrowing the future
How much future can he borrow
How much past can he forget
When now's become part of tomorrow
Just a flashy fast advertisement
That talks about beginning
At the end.
You imagine
You can change the world
And you're right
It's happening right here and now
Tonight tonight.
Relief for hungry children
Is nothing but a symptom
Of accelerated ignorance
Unaware of how a world
Forcloses on invading circumstance
And brings a new beginning
All at once
You imagine
You can change the world
And you're right
It's happening right here and now
Tonight tonight.
Where ice and desert travels
And the scale of justice levels
And the house that silly jack built
While forgetting ages cycling
Is crushed inside a moment he forgot
There'll be a new beginning
Thanks a lot
You imagine
You can change the world
And you're right
It's happening right here and now
Tonight tonight.

Roy Harper,"Well the bozos talk of dawn
But it feels like Monday morn
On the washing lines
We still fight for what we fought
But it's getting kind of short
With these futures on our heels
And our sails in fresh winds and new signs
As we sail away...
You may sometimes misconceive
Seeing elders quietly leave
And accusingly
Poiting say they failed
While in turn yourselves hang nailed
On the landmarks of your own dreams
Every tide rushes out losingly
As we sail away...
Well the morning slowly rose
We were gone as first light froze
All the nightmare stars
While the ghosts of former graves
Gentle whispers in the waves
Fleeting shadows in the sails
Shift their sands through old hands into ours
As we sail away...",Sail Away
Roy Harper,"Take a look down your highway
Tell me what d'you see
Well if you're down my way
It could well be me
Stood on your corner
I'm nearly down on one knee
Can you hear me calling for you
So damn easy to see
And it can't be forever
And it won't be for long
So don't you think that it's better
We speak the same tongue
Out here in this weather
We must surely belong
Birds of a feather
Whatever the song:
Please give me a lift man
It can't be for far
The way that you shift man
In your empty car,
I've got the highway blues
In my holy (holey, wholly) shoes
And I cannot choose
What I look like
And I got here from yesterday
On porridge and bait
Swallowing sorrow
Following fate
Poaching tomorrow
From God and the state
Of homo his shadow
The well known long haired straight
But I've got a good reason
For being this way
I'm happy for certain
And hoping to stay
Travelling trust
Across the new day
Gathering dust
Down your highway
Please give me a lift man...
It can't be for far
The way that you shift man
In your empty car
I've got the highway blues
In my holy shoes
And I cannot choose
What I look like
Out on the streets
Or where my drum beats
In between the clean sheets
Of my love life
And I need little Margaret
Out here again
Screwing some traffic
From the shaven insane
With thumbs like a dragnet
She pulls like a train
And she looks like a magnet;
And she comes like a warm rain
Please give me a lift man...",Highway Blues
Roy Harper,"If it was right to be believing,
And write his name in blood
And then I met him when I died,
Well I'd have it out with god
But if it means
Degrading scenes
And sanctioning crusade
I'd know we couldn't stand man to man
Without feeling afraid
If it was wrong for not believing,
In fairytale facade
And then I met him when I died,
Well I'd apologies to dog
But if it meant
I went down on my knees
Well where's the spirit gone
Where's the love you're all talking of
When you can't stand man to man?
Man to man
When you can't stand man to man.
I find it hard to believe,
In these 'gospels' that I've heard
The forked tongue of the bible belt,
The ayatollahs word
I don't believe most anything
Spoken by anyone
As hell's fanatic paranoids
Fire heaven's loaded gun
If it was right to be believing,
Then it must be in this
That difference is beautiful,
And living it is bliss,
There are no teams
There is no side
That life on earth is done
By living the love you're only talking of
By standing man to man
Man to man",If

I tried to ignore you
Because I knew
You'd haunt me
Until we grew
In my mind
An obsession
I just couldn't subdue
But now it's an avalance we ride
Head over heels into Eden
Laughing inside
With you the female
An imprint in detail
To fit my male
So perfectly
Like fairy tale
Patterns of fate
That had to prevail
But now it's an avalanche we ride
Head over heels into Eden

So hard to live
So scared

I can't stand itI can't stand it

You makes me kind of weak
And when you hold me tight
My poor heart skips a beat
And when I hear you say
That you will go away
And leave me someday
I can't stand it 
When you're standin' close to me
You make me kinda weak

That you will go away

Roy Head,"It's three o'clock in the morning
We've danced the whole night through
And daylight soon will be dawning
Just one more waltz with you
That melody so entrancing
Seems to be made for us two
I could just keep on dancing forever dear with you
 
There goes the three o'clock chime, chiming, rhyming
My heart keeps beating in time
Sounds like an old sweet love tune
Say that there soon will be a honeymoon
 
It's three o'clock in the morning
We've danced the whole night through

That's when I was wylin out
I couldn't care less about
Someone gettin hurt, I did my share of dirt

[Perion]
I went from ashy elbows, to loungin on Melrose
Stayin in the best suites for weeks
In (?) sheets, alone while you cryin at home
By the phone, hopin I'll call, everyday that I'm gone (alright)
Need connections, to make ends meet ma
In both directions, just to stay on my feet (huh)
Thinkin bout me when I got mouths to feed
A spouse and two seeds (yeah) they need me to eat (that's right)
Take out time to check myself
Thinkin it wasn't really me, silly me
No wonder you can't feel me, thinkin while I'm out I'm cheatin
Wylin out and freakin - blacks, whites and peurto ricans
While I'm hardly sleepin (me and the kids hardly eatin)
Seekin God for help 'cause we hardly speakin (that's right)
If it took God to bring me home (uh-huh) bring Jerome
to see that I was wrong, now David sing the song (uh-huh)

[Chorus] - 2X
[Hahz the Rippa]
Yo, aiyyo I sold drugs, sold coke, weed and dope (whattchu need?)
Sold shirts and socks, I even sold soap
Got too small for me, I sold my old coat (uh)
Walked in jewelry stores, and stole gold ropes (yes I did)
Look around, it's no cops, I want to shoplift
but who gon' give me a lift to go shop? (watch out!)
Get my rhyme on, clothes I tried on
and I walked out with, like the ones I got on (yeah)
Commitin crimes, fiends; I was givin 'em dimes
Under 25 and was still livin with moms
I just love the dough, I gotta get plenty (yo)
Used to trick with strippers with counterfeit twenties (whassup)
The streets that kept me hungry and left me bummy
I sold candy for my school and kept the money (alright)
In stolen cars I'm gettin chased -- I had to chill 'cause
(Dave: I was bout to catch a case!)

[Chorus] - 2X
[Roy Jones Jr.]
Yo
I used to go to this chick house, and go to that chick house (come on)
Call another chick over, kick the other chick out
I wasn't carin about, how none of 'em felt
They wanted to hang around me, like one of my belts (alright)
But I kept it movin, city to city, kitty to kitty
Throughout the states I was fifty for fifty
Get it with force, she fine; she could get it of course (alright)
Niggaz are warned, she married; she could get a divorce
Stayed up the rest of the night, right after the fight
Went from room to room, I was boom boom boom (room to room)
Fulfill ya fantasies with Roy Jones Jr. (what)
Girlfriend or wife, ya better hold on to her (uh)
A man's gotta do what he's got to do
She's in my hotel room - why she not with you? (alright)
It's like three in the mornin, she just stoppin through
As she walks in, her trenchcoat was droppin too
Light-skinned, long hair, yeah I popped her too
Yo I'll send her to ya room soon as Hahz get through
That's how we got down, I done stopped now
My mayne Peri' got a brother on lock down (on lock down!)

With my hair down in my eyes and she says ""Hi"" 
And I stumble to the breakfast table 
While the kids are goin' off to school goodbye 
And she reaches out 'n' takes my hand 
And squeezes it 'n' says ""How ya feelin', hon?""

That warm my heart and see my mornin' sun 
 
And if that's not lovin' me

And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime 
And there's no such thing as Doctor Seuss 
Or Disneyland, and Mother Goose, no nursery rhyme 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime 
And when my self is feelin' low 
I think about her face aglow and ease my mind 
 
Sometimes I call her up at home knowin' she's busy 
And ask her if she could get away and meet me 
And maybe we could grab a bite to eat 
And she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me 
And I'm always late 
But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me 
'cause she's made that way

They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along
