And good wood from a nigga in the hood
Ladies - shake it, shake it real girl should

Let it be understood,
That I'm wit' my friends and we ready to go
Connects wit' (?) to Santo Domingo!
And I, won't west 'til I poppin' at the show

Watchin' all my people shoutin' ""Go, ma, go!""

Shake it down, shake it down (uh-oh, uh-oh!)

{*car tires peeling out*}

[Angie Martinez]
Let's get it on it's Angie Mar' reportin live from the streets
From Y.O. to Philly and Harlem to Q.B.
When it drops it's game over, you'll see
Introducing, Jadakiss and Styles P, where you at?

[The L.O.X.]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
You know we still in the hood dog, in front of the store
With the work across the street and the gun in the stall
Soon as somethin happen niggaz want to run to the law
You know the code of the streets, never run to the law
That's why I can't even run 'less I run with a four
or I walk with a three, come and talk to 'em P
You can catch me down bottom with a bird and a glock
On the block makin money where they murder a lot
Or you can catch me up top shootin dice for a yard
I'm talkin six digits, niggaz bet the house or the car
You can catch me hittin the spliff, sick in the pit
On the fiend like I'm missin my shit, they think I'm crazy
Catch me hittin your lady in my Mercedes
Bird on your baby, fuck you I'm keepin it gravy
L.O.X. hold the hammers
like we waitin for screws
With Angie Mar' BLOWIN MOTHERFUCKERS OUT OF THEY SHOES, WHAT?

[Angie Martinez]
Comin live from the streets where some died tryin to eat
From Y.O. to Philly, from Harlem to Q.B.
And when it drops, game over, you'll see
Introducin, Beanie Sigel, tell me how you livin?

[Beanie Sigel]
Aiyyo, I've been kickin murder - since Adidas with thick strings
T.I. sweatsuits, Pumas with thick chains
Four finger rings, black belts with brass names
I was spittin flames since niggaz was pitchin change
I'm a hard knock kiddo, always played the middle
Threw flacks in the crack game, getchu if I can getchu
Since a buck, played the highway, dodgin the troop boys
Jumpin in and out of Coupes, wavin for Duke boys
Always chased a penny, copped quarter waters
Tried to make a dollar chased my pop's boss daughters
Tryin to make my name, global, in all four corners
Philly baller, gamin in all four quarters
Never worked, never will - all my hoes buy my clothes
I can't go broke, never will - all my bros buy my O's
I'm the best thing that linked up with New York since Sprewell
I murder, nuttin further - fill in the details

[Brett]
I'm here, it's over, fuck how why'all feel
When I drop, why'all gon' realize it's all real
Bein left for dead, tied up, smoke 'til I was dried up
So high up, seem like the sky ducked, high what?
Life was rough, but now it's nothin to hide
Used to click and be quick to put this gun to yo' side
Be like, ""That chain nice - I like that pal.
Matter fact {*click click*} I'd like that now.""
You've got game? Call the name, just spell the name right
Brett, one of the best rappers ever to touch a mic
It's prophecized I'd write, spit scriptures mind blowin
'til my coffin top close and heaven skies open
Fear no man's my slogan, I hope why'all believe
I'm just like you, fear nuttin human that bleeds
My mind breed two movies, six ab-lums, a hundred poems
Thirty R&B joints, I'm beyond the norm, why'all just mad
I'm just glad, got my time to shine
why'all the type to hit three hundred bars and run out of rhymes

[Angie Martinez]
Brett, from my ByStorm family, with Angie
Come live from the streets, from Harlem to Q.B.
And when it drops, game over, you'll see
Introducin, finally, the legendary cool G.

[Kool G. Rap]
It's B.G.S. kid so what you facin? Caps racin
Decapitation twenty buck-fifties and lacerations
Guerilla fam' camouflaged out in the grass waitin
to blass your nation slash like Jason and bash your face in
We ass lacin top bodies and half in the basement
Our style, cast you so bad you'll need plastic replacement
When gats is raised in, fascination blastin and blazin
Evacuation for your whole staff there's gas in the tank and
Gets back abrasions from cap grazin, defy gravitation
Pull my shit back squeeze bust it like masturbation
Hold fort, hold the blow torch, leave your soul scorched
with no remorse, the state of New York, get your shit caught
When niggaz hawk, let the fifth talk
So tell me who's the next man to flip?
I stop the beef shit, with rubber handled grips
Your candle get lit, guerilla shit feed us banana clips
The hammers hit, anything in our range we dismantle it

Uhh.. uhh.. yo-yo, uhh, yo
They say it ain't where you from that it's where you at
But where I'm from, why'all can tell, don't matter where I'm at
Born and bred in the streets of New York, New York
It's evident in the way that I talk-a-talk
I travel abroad by the Concorde, with a Clue tape (Clue!)
Stop in Sicily and tell 'em they pizza fake
And I keep the faith in the Knicks, them fuckers
And I'm quick to get slick with the lip and word to mother
love a dude with a doo-rag, from where we suffer
from growin up too fast, I'm a rude ass bitch when I need to be
But I'm cool as shit if you real with me, you feelin me?
I never sleep like my city when it's time to get this money
Got game, spot game, so don't act funny (hah hah)

From Staten, to Long Island, we make it happen, out in

Thug love, thug love 
All she ever wanted was that thug loooooove 
Thug love, thug love 
All she ever wanted was that thug, love 
[Angie - over end of hook] 
Yo, hey yo, uhh 
Yo, yo, yo-yo, uhh 
Aiyyo I met him at a club, spendin dubs, Mr. Superthug 
Pulled up with a group of trucks, everybody knew who he was 
I ain't playin the boy was cute, and I'm sayin 
we only danced one song but the whole night I was swayin 
Mesmorized by his style, could tell he was wild 
but he had a touch of class and a million buck smile 
Got a thing for a thug and he fit the profile 
Thug love, think I'm buggin brother let me know now 
[Fat Joe - overlapping Angie] 
Yo.. yeah, uhh 
Yo, yo.. 
What's his name, what's the color of his Range, what's his game? 
Was he kickin it like he love his train, full of octane? 
Stop playin, know you ain't fall for that 
(Yo he's pagin me) Ang' don't even think of callin back 
Man I know those cats, him and his click be flowin crack 
Up in Prominax(?), stickin them kids, by the laundromat 
Pumpin that two-for-five, the rules imply 
fuckin with them dudes that's trife, you lose your life 
[Interlude]
[F] It's a thug love 
[A] Searchin for love in the wrong places 
[F] A thug love

[F] It's a thug love 
[A] Searchin for love in the wrong places 
[F] A thug love 
[A] Lovin them rough with pretty faces

[hook - overlaps Interlude but comes in on line three]
[Angie] 
I just can't explain why women are attracted to danger 
A thug and a player look the same in linen but one's packin a banger 
I guess it's the anger that be in they eyes 
mixed together with a pinch of they sensual side that gets me energized 
Fly and confidant, respected and highly dominant 
Got me on the rise every time he draw me with compliments 
Joey I'm fallin for a thug, should I sacrifice 
or let it go brother you never gave me bad advice 
[Fat Joe] 
It's only right that I let you know which route to go 
No doubt fo' sho', once he hits it, he's out the do' 
Know I seem like a cock-blocker, but he's not proper 
Besides you're my little sis, I gotta watch ya 
Gotta stop you from dealin with snakes 
You're sealin your fate let alone I feel it's your wake 
Eliminate all the wrongs in your life 
Don't you fall for them guys, like Pun says, it's all in the eyes 
[Interlude + hook] 
[Fat Joe] 
I only speak on what I know, he cheats, he gotta go 
You think he ain't gon' creep (not at all) 
That's a damn shame, I see you fallin for this man's game 
The truth is even if he want it man he can't change 
That's the life of a player livin lies like the mayor 
Hittin them thighs, be wise and beware 
But don't be surprised, one day you'll find a decent guy 
Someone that cares and provides a piece of mind 
[Angie] 
I know you right, but I'm torn inside 
I got a jonz for a boy that was born to ride 
My only vice(?), saw the guy, leave my momma mortified 
It's no surprise, it happens all the time 
Got me stressin and I'm comin back for me 
Got me, checkin my messages expectin him to call 
I need to, let it go need to stay focused 
But can't, forget him yo so I remain hopeless

Welcome to ""Animal House"" 
The animals are in the building
It's a new day

[Verse: Angie]
Angela... Better known as Angie
We are animals... Animal House... wut we are... animals
Uh yeah uh yeah uh uh uh yeah uh uh
All I could do is give you me if you choose to believe it's on you
I live in peace I could sleep but I don't choose I'ma animal the promos
The station, the movies rap Rebecca Lobo
I run elbows with people you couldn't a ""Hello"" from
With a mask and a gun you don't gotta ask how come or where I'm at
I work! I want to make that clear to cats
Nuttin's free and no you can't run to me
I'm ten years deep you to young for me
You could sleep while I drop album number three and 
Yeah you could hate but somebody lovin' me
Evidently number one at 3 with videos on MTV 
You could learn from me then it's back to the streets can't be serious
Haha that isn't funny album still sold can't be curious

[Chorus]
Animals that's how it is that's how we are
Walk with our heads up high 'cause we
Animals-straight beasts 18 hours a day work no sleep 
We are animals that's how it is that's what we are we are animals
Walk with our heads up high 'cause we animals- straight beasts
18 hours a day work no sleep

[Verse: Sacario]
You ain't know em like the highway patrol
I stay on a roll like Joe Smooth on your back I got creative control
A vocal coach shows singas how to flow
When our engineers songs we verb highs and lows if the shit ain't clear
This year I hope you chose to retire or expire 'cause what I propose is a resonation 
'cause the animals is aqua now and all your deticated fans is rolling with me now
I gotta lock to the 5 0 1 n 3 now you gotta watch you can rhyme doin them freestyles 
I rather not just do it I make records and write sixteen bars in 500 seconds 
It's Sacario AKA Mr. Guntalo BDS news track
My spins is a problem so BMI throw me parties
My publicin is lots a dough we animals get me and ""ang"" espacio

[Chorus]
[Verse: Angie]
Look I'ma professional (I'ma professional)
I'm not stressing you I do what's best for me
You do what's best for you (best for you)
I'm not concerned with the bullshit 
Never was (never was) I'm wouldn't check that respect that
I meant 'cause bloods, kings, nietas, and zulus (zulus)
All over this world most who do you
I put in work interviews, shows, promos, rehearsals, reverse moves
All of that shows back to interviews
No time for self, none nigga drive-through diner
No time for my health I'm dyin' hehe
I wonder how I'm surviving myself
Angie OG baby got the title in belt
Queen (quueeeeeeeeeeeeeeen) of hip-hop radio
through the many years blood sweatin tears
Be clear happy to be here on the sequel I'm still workin
I know you got hate in your blood it's still hurtin

{Lil' Mo] Yeaaaaaaaaaaayyyy!!!
[Angie M] Uh, woo! come on, uh
[Lil' Mo] If I can go, with you
[Angie M] Yo, yo, uh

[Verse 1: Angie Martinez]
If I can chose a place to go it gotta be far away
From here we could crossover like Hardaway
Somewhere outside the states where tomorrow's like today
And I'm out in a space where nobody else can stay
And, if I can go, with you
Then I'll go get the ticket right now if that's cool
Have you ever been close to feelin like leavin the coast too
Feelin like leavin with somebody who
Hold you the right way while watchin the night fade
Make you feel like you right back in the ninth grade
When you know what he likes and what he might say
And you try to be calm and answer in nice ways
And, if I can go, with you
Way out the states no 2 ways and no page
No cells and no trace, and you just a phone call away
So all I got to say is

[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away

[Verse 2: Sacario]
And, if I can go, with you
Oh boy we 'bout to make a lot of people annoyed
And cry you better know I know how to sneak with them toys
And boy with the block since around 94 boy
And, if I can flow, with you
Huggin Tato after the studio I roll with you
I send Dutch and three other goons to go get you
Sacario the name hold weights the whole issue
Grown men keep on cryin get mo' tissue
The way me and this girl be rhymin it's so official
Them I'm takin a trip too with no pistols
Cause everything peace only sand no streets
Little Miami Heat that's the plan we'll see
Two cups, one in Senado one in Sand Beach
And, I'll think I'll go, with you
So tell the station you need a week back to you

[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away

[Bridge: Lil' Mo]
You can fly away, no one has to know
Will you take me with you, cause if I can go
Soon as you say the word, we'll be on our way
To a foreign place, you got to tell me

[Angie Martinez]
Yo, uh, so now that we got a plan are you comin? We could plan a week
The only question now is LaGuardia or Kennedy?

[Sacario]
And a seat, know why? the window cause I like to see
And seein as to how I'm so fly me and the clouds can speak

[Angie+S] 
And, since we 'bout to go, in a few

[Sacario] 
Go 'head

[Angie Martinez]
Oh, I just wanted to tell Trace thank you
That week off I'm grateful what was you tryin to say boo?

[Sacario] 
Nuttin just grab my chain off the table and 2 way too

[Angie Martinez]
Ok, that little place it's a great move
But ain't no problems, unless the water don't stay blue

[Sacario]
And the shop's there?

[Angie Martinez]
If they don't got em, they don't make em

No concrete just sand, throw away your shoes
Now, that we are on, our way
And our bags is packed and the car service is not late
Everything's ok, so I guess I catch you on the next track
Now I don't gotta ask

[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If I can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away

Angie Martinez,"[Intro: Girl]
And you will never break me til the day I die

[Verse: Angie]
Yo everytime I turn around they say 
How I deal with that weak shit
I told y'all of the stages I can't agree wit
We showed y'all, promoted y'all on how to freak shit
But here's a little secret...
Uh uh we still number one, blazin Hip-Hop and R&B quick
'cause it's simple and plain, now can you sit and complain quick
When we payed the way for you to get in the game chicks
Nigga's wuteva...it's only the real that they recognize by the real
And since you don't recognize you know the deal
How I feel? I don't know emotions get showed
If anything I feel violated being that we been cloned
Reporterz quit, I don't get caught up in the mix
10 years deep, I was brought up in this shit
OG , big truck series, the cars is gone
Any questions? I'll be directing your comments
To alkatron...sing that shit

[Chorus]
A primitive mind is all I, all I ever had 
And you will neva break me til the day I die

[Verse: Angie]
My reputation and my name is superb
Now add that with animal house and a flow that's like rain down a curb
'cause I, write a verse and I change a few words, edit and perfected it ..
And and... I'm still on the air about the dough
Be clear, you gotta go each year we lock and load 
Beware I'm outta control animal mode will let you know not to 
hand me no goal
Everything I write hot like my hand on a stove
The (?) know bullshit don't effect me like a ""Die Hard"" knicks fan
So no mas if's and's
I could show you how power shit get ran and I can't get budged
'cause when your best friend is the jury bottom line is you can't get judged
And that last line went over ya head so
You'll probably never know til your dead either way
What I said is real, sing!

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse: Angie]
Uh yo uh..
And I'm not bein cocky
'cause I work my way up
And even tho' it hurt never gave up 
Went from handin' out fliers to number one major.. I don't
I'm about dollars, hold your to cents saved up
Dropped my first album never rock in my life 
Did everything on mah own wrote the songs, hit the mic
Get the beats all nice stayed up got it right 
Minimal help, felt alone
Now you got a problem right?
'cause it's animal house, the team is here
It's a new day with me this year be clear, I'm focused
Best coaches, way too many peeps
Pro to machines and way to much heat
Still grounded never been way up in the sky
Workaholic still spend days inside
Angie, you could never break me, I move wise
And that's til the day I die, ohh, my, GOD

[Repeat Chorus]",Never
Angie Martinez," 

[Intro: A. Martinez]
Yo, uh
The animals are here
It's a new day...yo yo uh

It's about being close to the ground
like dope fiends and not even fallin'
Some people frontin' now they keep callin'
But that's life, ain't no grudge in my heart
I could sleep mornings, that's the business
I just keep that shit apart, that's the wisdom

In my position get hard, I deal wit people from far
Very few I keep close, that's how you keep from the scars
You gotta move like a ghost, cause some people are stars
And all of a sudden.. they forgot who they are

But look at me I'm still Angie, back wit a plan be	
It's a new day you could sit down or stand me
I just try to be an example, bringin' the animal out
When everybody doubting underhand me
Its ample time, If you could not see the big picture
Cause there's plenty ladies like me I'm a big sista
Always on the grind through whatever you say
And just incase you ain't clear its okay
It's a new day!

[Chours1: 2x]
If you need it to be, (uh) Then it can be (yea)
It happen for me, It's a new day (a new day)

[Chours2: 2x]
Keep hoping, Keep focus
Approaching, up, A new day

Reaction to my first verse in a year it was clearly unexpected
Me on a record, We must yea agree it was hectic
Getting here half sleep and eating breakfast in my chair
How I feel, it's a new day now, that's for real
I was prepared to deal wit, whatever was given
People dissecting what I'm spitting on, not giving me a chance
Listen and understand, they ain't know how to react
Off my 16 bars on that track, ""She out or she back Damn""
Then came a record (""If I could go"")
I'm not saying my shits perfected
But if I could go's the beginning accept it, connected
You already know, yes is an automatic question
Automatically answered cause I'm flowing like you never heard
Why second one it can't be said in words
Except it had to be done, in other words I'm leaving on top
You mad at me huh, believe it won't stop
The love it's much stronger you can not break my hunger

[Chorus1: 2x]
[Chorus2: 2x]

See they love for you to give up, can't wait for you to slip up
As soon as you hit rock bottom, they never picking you up
Or never picking you out, they always out when you pick
But when your outfits is sick, or you got a hit
Then every other word is, ""No Doubt,
 When can we go out, When can we grab lunch,"" I only get mad once
Cause when you get mad twice you sacrifice then a punch
And then a situation jumps so I grab a blunt
Roll it and spark it cause you media targets
Pictures is blatant ya know what I'm saying
This ain't ancient this is today shit
but it's a new day shit no games get played shit
No time get wasted, I learn from the worst situations (""yep"")
And I made it, everything I had in my heart I pushed and gave it
So when I say it's a new day I mean it
Cause when it's the truth you must agree shit!

[Chorus1: 2x]
[Chorus2: 2x]
ya hear me singing

[Chorus2: 2x]

Angie Martinez,"[Angie]
He was all I wanted, late night talkin', 
On the phone till daylight often, 
At home he came through, dinner on the table, 
Plate bites lost him, the love was strong then, 
We went for walks then, then I lost him, 
I mean he's still her but I ignore him, 
'cause he's too busy for me, 
He comes around a few minutes then leave, 
Things ain't the way they used to be, 
Then I met this guy right down the street, 
And this is what he said to me

Hello good lookin', tell me how are you, 
Every time I see you baby, lookin' so 
Good,let me show you girl, I can be so good

I tried to work things out, bring things back 
Arguments started, you don't know how to act, 
Could a brought up the fact, that today I met this new dude, 
And I don't need the say it, he probably would a thought I was playin', 
And he probably would a said stop playin', 

But this bullshit I'm about to stop, takin', 
'Cause this new guy's about to drop, waitin', 
I ain't playin, he played him self, 
Need space need time, oh well, you can have all the space in the world, and 
Your man might have found a new girl

Even though you don't know me, what can I do, 
Let me see you girl, one Saturday afternoon, 
Let me show you girl, I can be so good

Every girl need's affection, not somebody who's stressin', 
Hope he learned his lesson, 'cause in one direction, 
You can't see to the left and, you're stuck wit a dumb fuck, 
Who don't understand that one truck, don't matter to you, 

No car crib either, just you and him in a two seat a, 
But they always find out when its too late, 
Tellin' me to wait, no you wait, 
Wait till you see me in his arms, 
And understand that I'm gone

Hello good lookin', tell me how are you, 
I see you girl, walkin' that avenue, 
Let me show you girl, I can be so good",So Good
Angie Martinez,"I got a call from my girls around eight about that Friday spot
Round 12 hit the highway stop, I need gas
Car behind me on my ass, speed pass
Turn the radio on that's my joint got me and I need to dance

Pull up in the truck and it ain't my man's
You screaming ""hey yo"", you don't got a chance
Son, you are speaking a language I don't understand
Know the dude I hang with, I don't hold his hand

Cause, me, I'm free to choose 
It's possible to leave with you
When we get through, I drive passenger seat for you
Let's ride

At one I arrive
Walked past the line
Damn his ass is fine 
Some guy now we up in the spot

Watch
Place hot 
Couple of bottles champagne popped
And that's how we doing it now

I'm scheming while the DJ's moving the crowd

[Chorus: x2]
I was wondering if I could take you home
Would ya still love me baby, if I could take you home
I was wondering if I could take you home
Would ya still love me baby, if I could take you home

It's around 2 A.M. 
The mood is trend 
The club is snug
I see him watching, love is love
Caught him when I looked up, gave him a glance
Promotion chick walked over while I'm shaking her hand
I'm looking over her
Sorry but I'm waiting for this man
Is what I told her, so she could leave
No breaking up my plans 
No time for talking about shows 
Or dates that I could host
Damn, he walking over to me, they breaking out the jokes
My girls laughing 
They see me already imagining
He whispered in my ear, would I dance with him 
I answered him
He took my hand with him 
Dancing close
I turned around and gave him my back, he passed a smoke
He put his hand on my hip, then my stomach 
He must want it 
And I was really just 'bout to leave, his clique fronted
Like they don't see 
That they man 'bout to tell 'em peace
And to think, I wasn't even gonna go out..see?

[Chorus]

All I need is my lip gloss, I.D., gum, and I'm straight
Especially if it's Envy in bungalow eight
We making it hot on the dance floor today
But my girls want to leave cause there's nothing to take
Nothing to meet 
Spot dead, nothing to see
Then we all agree that we won't leave
Cause some spots the papi's still come at three
That's when I tell the DJ to run that please
He dancing behind me 
I feel what's under his jeans
And I had one too many so I'm under his scheme
I mean I'm cool and the gang 
The music is playing
Think I found what I'm looking for, no purpose in waiting
Almost time for breakfast 
Standing by the coat checkers
Looking for my parking lot ticket, that's it
And this night just ended 
Can't say with who, what, or where but it'll definitely be remembered

[Chorus]

Would you be my boyfriend? 
Would you be my boyfriend? 
Would you be my boyfriend? 
For tonight only
Would you be my boyfriend?
Would you be my boyfriend?
Would you be my boyfriend?
For tonight only",Take You Home

Woke up in the spot with the shiny whips
Keep talkin' a lot - bring out the grimey chicks
Incase you forgot how the grimey get

Niggas surround this shit, let me remind you chick
How one hit can leave you all blind and shit
Have to send your little friends to come find your shit
But right now there's really no time to flip

Unless you busy, you can party wit us

'Till the mornin' come, then we on the run
Then we do it again - cause that's how it is
On them ones, playa that's how it is
Talk money? it's done that, just biz

I'm sitting here thinking that sound is still bangin'
As we leavin' the spot I'm still drinking
Gotta' leave cause the cops are still waiting
So we circle the block, as we workin' to blot
Then purposely watch, we so blingin'
And the truck is bright, light up the night
Blinking, as we stuck in the chair feel like we sinking
That sound still drowned the air waves
The echo in my head feel like a bear cave
So I sit back to the sound of this track
Playin' on my way home, I can't forget that
That beat when you hear from the street
Make you want to get on the floor and don't even speak
Cause it don't even matter who be around
Get, and that's DJ Keith, playin' that sound (I need that)

Maybe I'll start changing

I'm stackin' the odds at one to three
I'm givin' the benefit to you

Angie Stone,"Hope this isn't enough said
Ain't got time to be a-makin' up my own bed
Hope this don't offend you
It's insulting and I've gotten that, too
I've been saving up so I can feel right
Keepin' up by stashing funk in my backpack
Watching other's slide back on politics
Guess to know the game is to know the tricks

If you can't stand the heat, get out the kitchen
If you can't stand, stand the heat get out the kitchen

Oh no, listen
Went to church on Sunday mornin'
On my knees while I was prayin'
Askin' God for the strength to
To just keep on winning (He said)

If it wasn't for yo' momma
Never thinkin' I was good enough
If it wasn't for yo' brother
Always checkin' every move I gave up
If it wasn't for that bitch
Down the block always in yo' ear
Be no room for messin' up
But baby love, you'd be right here

Tell me why must I, since they bought us things
Suffer indefinitely for loving you
Sugar why must I prove to anybody but you
Feel I been chosen to loose
I paid my dues, oh

[Chorus]

I'd been lying too, if I said to you
That they're pressuring me away from you
It's that she's run this
Got us fighting over dumbness
Got my heart on some numbness
That's your momma and I can't take it (no more)
I gets no joy but when I hurt
So when it hurts, it really hurts

[Chorus]

Gotta learn to keep your family out the game
When you're trying to do your thing
They got more that's due
Just cause momma fed you right all your life
Don't mean she walk on a perfect line
Watch your step, or pay the price, sacrifice

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Gimme an ounce of some honesty
Some innocence and a cup of loyalty
A tablespoon of some attitude
And of course a pinch of freak

At least a pound of conversation
Some attention when it comes to relation
Two quarts of intelligence
And a gallon of righteousness, oh

Yeah, yeah yeah (Yeah, yeah)
What I need is a smidgen of strength and a whole lot of stamina
What I want is a liter of respect and a damn good listener

So let's let it marinate for about 365 days

Angie Stone,"Look at then and when you got caught up
Reminiscing 'bout the past
Driving by on easy street

If nothing else, our love was heaven sent

Joy that's hard to find

To some of us here right now
Don't think you'd ride on this thin ice

Show you the path to the garden
You got to follow me in

And you tend to misuse
Every opportunity to right your wrong
You're causin' more problems

You got mad issues
And you tend to abuse
Every opportunity to make it good
You're causin' more problems
With no way to solve them
Time has come, and boy I really wish you would

Don't be acting like me, you've been rich all of your life
Don't be breaking crews cause you've had it good for sometime
Use a masquerade, and stop blowing me shame
Stop pretending to be somebody you're not

Looking back, reminiscing on
Caught a brother doing bad, and you put me on 
You told me not to be ashamed of what I got
Never mind them hatin' niggas up and down the block, babe 
You held it down and the bills got paid 
She said, ""Go ahead baby, do your singin' thing
And when God blesses us I want a Lexus
With a hide away mansion in the Hamptons""

Girl you must have lost your way from heaven 
Could it be for me you came so far
There is nothing like the honor of every woman
You're the very beat inside my heart
Girl your like a star I feel so high, 
Shining like a diamond in outer space
Girl your like my mother, my sister, my lover
Irreplaceable, nothing can take your place

You're the blood in my veins, you're the air I breathe
On a hot summer day your like a shirt with no sleeves
What makes me a man, any fool could see
You're more then a woman to me

Girl if you take that back, there would be no cure
I would sail there forever, like a ship with no shore 
What makes me a man, any fool can see
You're more then a woman to me

Look at us, living luxury 
And I been thinking maybe we should start a family 
A girl for you, and a boy for me 
Matching stones separate guests, would you marry me
And if you'd have me I'd gladly give my life
Today I'd take this vow to make you my wife
Nothing temporary you know its quite contrary
Just you and me for an eternity

Can't let up long enough to get over it

I tried to find a tree where we could lay happily
In the shade, gradually there were things revealed

I can't even hold down a job, tryna follow up and
Behind me
You're over-protective and you're jealous
Change when you're around the fellows

Look at you, look at you, running around like a damn
Fool
So busy accusing me, when it's your insecurity

You need an inner appeal so your anger just relieve
I never meant to cause you pain
But it was there before I came
Makin' crazy accusations, tracing all of my
Footsteps
For reactin', got me packin' tryin' to get out before you
Get back in
Look at me, look at me, I can't allow you to live

Took your pocket knife, carved our names on a tree
My heart skips a beat to whatever you say

You are my focus, you're the air that I breathe
Can't imagine you with someone else other than me
You don't kiss me no more, and I need your energy
Tell me where will I fly to if you set me free

[Chorus]
Stars fell like snowflakes on my head 
Now there's emptiness in my bed
I still believe all the things you said
Though I can see the flowers are dead

But terrible lies and emptiness fills my soul
You were so warm, now you feel so cold
The last time we kissed, your eyes were open
Is this just a phase, I'm praying and hoping

(You) Failed me, I gave you the key 
To the entry in my heart, you became part of me
Told you everything, I shared all my secrets with you
And the words you fed my soul, I pray to God that you

Trampled on my heart, threw away the key
Since you went away, all I see
I can't even eat, I don't want to sleep
But I see you in my dreams
I pray that you come back 'cause I need you here
You can kiss away all my tears
Hold me in your arms, whisper in my ear
That will take away my fears

Angie Stone,"Tried so many times to make some sense of it
Unsure about the people in the mix
My sacred intention
My moment to mention
Just what it is I was called here to do

Love somebody, give somebody, teach somebody, touch somebody.
And when the good gets misunderstood
The repercussions can be cruel
And that ain't cool
Karma will avenge you

I've often seen the faces of despair
And been in situations people don't care
They take advantage of your every move
That ain't cool cause I'm no fool
They monopolize your time
Try to redesign your mind
The very time they use to find
You're in this love for sharing

Love somebody, give somebody, teach somebody, touch somebody
And when the good gets misunderstood
The repercussions can be cruel
And that ain't cool
Karma will avenge you

To me the world is stingy with love
Everybody for self
And when you finally find love then people hate you to death
A constant struggle between you and your mental muscles
Emotional paranoia with feeling nobody loves ya
No one to reach to
Gravity seen you
You the one in church that the preachers will preach to
And you're prayer just for confession
More blessings
Try to get protection from manic depression and keep stepping
From mean impressions
The supper comes with dressing
Attached with life and karma and its own lessons
And that's faith and love and peace and trust
And never participate with the evil in us
And life ain't fair when you feel wear and tear
Remember God don't put more into you than you can bear
And believe that to death
A long journey don't start til the first step
And that's life

Love somebody, give somebody, teach somebody, touch somebody
And when the good gets misunderstood
The repercussions can be cruel
And that ain't cool
Karma will avenge you",Karma

You know, When I first started doin' this thing

Beyond what money can buy

My heart is never dry

Even though we're still in the struggle

You'll always be apart of my life
We're inseparable

[Chorus]
All I see is you
In the sky, on my mind
Whispers in the night
Your sweet tone
In your arms is where I call home

I remember when we had no furniture
Just a color TV
And a carpet and some pillows
And we both were so happy
And we stuck it out together
And now it's more than what we had
Which ain't much, but things could be worse
Thank God I can't be mad, no

Even though we're still in the struggle

And they know I'm a constant fool for you
So I'm puttin' my things on a U-Haul

Cause ninety per cent, I done already heard
How long did you think that I would sit here for
I'm lettin' you know, it's not exceptional

Ain't no conversation, you can save the games
And anything you say, I will remain the same
How long did you think that I would sit here for
Destroying my soul, it ain't exceptional

I can't believe you even tried to blame me
Cause you're the one that changed, I've been the same me
And I've been by your side like a two-way
And like a pager with no clamp, that's how you lose me
So my friends come, they help me get over you

That I wouldn't find love, I would be lonely
Cause you, you (made) made (me) me (feel so damn low)
So low, low low, low low, low low

This is tragic like when Michael left The Jacksons
I told you, you should be careful what you're asking

Had a lot of sun and a lot of rain
I had some joy and broken hearted
But now that doesn't mean a thing
I'm living for the joy and laughter
Longing for my befores and afters
All in all it's been cool
And there's nothing I wouldn't do
I'm so happy being me

[Chorus]
Oh
So happy being me
I'm regretting noting about me
Too busy living life, living love, freely
So happy being me

Stop reaching back from your beginnings
All those broken dreams that went down stream
As we grow, live and know
Some things were never meant to be
Just like people they come and go
Some will live forever and some will never know
That's why god gives us memories
To leave us to our victories
I'm so happy loving me

[Chorus]

All those hidden treasures
Feeling nothing but pleasure
We could never replace, is love (We can't no we can't no)
The sunlight leads us to a place and moonlight keeps us in it's grace
I'm so happy being me

[Chorus]",Happy Being All
Angie Stone,"Now we been traveling this road left too far
So with love, my best regards
I'm giving you the time and the space
Yes, you need just a little more faith
If you're gonna grow, then you need to know
When it's time to just let go
Cause life is too short to be pretend
We're in the beginning when it's the end

[Chorus x2]
Oh oh, here we go... a-gain
Trying to make it right
When it don't make sense, no

Now we're both knowing what the problem is
Instead of letting go, trying to make it fit
Making a fool out of love
Ending up in the same predicament
If we're gonna grow, then we need to know
When it's time to just let go
Life is too short to pretend
We're in the beginning when it's the end

[Chorus x2]

I trusted you with everything
Gave you my all to make you stay
You took, but never understood my pain
Now I gotta leave you
Love I'm on my way

[Chorus x2]

Time to let it go now
Wherever we would go from here
I'm praying

Nothing but joy, happiness

So busy worryin' bout the little things
When someone else is doing worse than me
Somebody out there got a child in need

Maybe ain't even healthy
Cause in the forest there ain't no trees
Don't tell me that don''t make you stop and thing

I watched my best friend Jamie slipping further away
I kept on waving till I couldn't see her
And through my tears I asked again why we couldn't stay
Mama whispered softly time will ease your pain
Life's about changing nothing ever stays the same
And she said how can I help you to say goodbye it's okay to hurt and it's okay to cry
Come let me hold you and I will try how can I help you to say goodbye

I sat on our bed he packed his suitcase I held a picture of our wedding day
His hands were trembling we both were crying
He kissed me gently and then he quickly walked away
I called up mama and she said time will ease your pain

She said how can I help you...

She opened her eyes and then squeezed my hand
She said I have to go now my time here is over

It's all over and I'm standin' pretty
In the dust that was a city

Just to prove the world was here
And here it is, a red balloon
I think of you and let it go",99 Red Balloons
Angry Salad,"Well, Cindy Oleo, the margarine girl
She says to me, ""I don't like boys.""
I tell her I don't like them either; she tells me I don't understand
So I stand there, and I stand there, yeah, but I guess I didn't know

I didn't know any better; I didn't know she might prefer
I need an answer to my letter, is she really going out with her?

Speaking of, I've got a couple words for the author of the book of love
Never wrote a chapter about this
Now, maybe there were pages I missed, (I'm not that bright)
I know it was a long time ago
As I stare up at her broken window; I turn my back, and I walk home

I didn't know any better; I didn't know she might prefer
I need an answer to my letter, is she really going out with her?

It would be so hard, it would take... take some time, but I've got time
In my mind, I go there sometimes; in my mind, I go there
All this time alone, and I feel fine, I feel fine
All this time alone, and I feel fine, I feel fine
In my mind, in my mind, in my mind, oh, in my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind

Angry Salad,"The song plays on my empty radio
I remember, kneeling before the parts on the floor
Of the radio I took apart to find Elvis
But he'd left this building
And I can't deny; since then, I've wondered why
The songs they play, and the songs I hear
Do they ring true in my ears?

You can't pull this wool any tighter over our eyes
And I wanted so, and I wanted oh-so badly
I want to go where I don't know
Why songs play on my empty radio

And the radio's turning me off, damn the radio
And I say damn the radio, full speed ahead

And my father'd drive; I'd take the shotgun side
With the window down and the signal clear
In hopes I'd hear the cheap trick record
Over and over, and over again
Till I could believe

And I wanted so, and I wanted oh-so badly
Who's got the answers 'cause I've got some questions?
When they hit the stage, do they feign the rage
That plays so well on empty radio?

Everything, it gets destroyed; (Where I don't know)
Everything, it gets destroyed; (Why songs play on my empty radio)
Everything is empty radio

And the radio's turning me off, I know that I...
The only thing that I think that I believe is we've been had, we've been had

Every grade level sings his song, but no one stays on top that long
You couldn't shoulder what he knew was the weight

And the radio's turning me off, I know that I...
I find it hard to believe, but if, if, if, if, if, if, if, I believe
That we've been had, we've been had

You won't find my spirit here, oh, my heart, find it hard

Great white father, playing favorites with his favorite sons
A people fall like leaves before the storm
Sleep no longer, oh, you Choctaw and the Iroqouis

Poisoned our water with fire, pushing us from our homes
Taken every promise, leave them broken, broken like stone

Staring at a chair where her folks had been
All she wanted to tell them was: ""I'm alright.""
It's late, and a stillness hangs on her wall
Broken by the sound of the faint footfalls
As the last orderly moves slowly into the night

[Bridge]
And a song that she used to know, from a pocket radio
And it floats from the floor above; song she used to love
Reminds her of the time when she had any place to go

[Chorus]
Is this time?  Is it all I've got?  (She thinks)
Is this life?  Is it all I've got?
That you could walk away and leave me with something I can't fight, yeah
This thing has got a hold of me and all my Saturday... all my Saturday nights

She thinks to herself, I'll hide them underneath my tongue
In the moment she's aware of what she won't become
When she feels herself slipping, she whispers: ""I'm alright.""
The ceiling reflects headlights coming over the hill
She's lying on her back, and she's perfectly still
She knew they'd come back for her, but they fade out of sight

Y va brotando, brotando
Como el musguito en la piedra
Ay sí sí sí

Mi paso retrocedido
Cuando el de ustedes avanza
El arco de las alianzas
Ha penetrado en mi nido
Con todo su colorido
Se ha paseado por mis venas
Y hasta las duras cadenas
Con que nos ata el destino
Es como un diamante fino
Que alumbra mi alma serena

Lo que puede el sentimiento
No lo ha podido el saber
Ni el más claro proceder
Ni el más ancho pensamiento
Todo lo cambia el momento
Cual mago condescendiente
Nos aleja dulcemente
De rencores y violencias
Solo el amor con su ciencia
Nos vuelve tan inocentes

El amor es torbellino
De pureza original
Hasta el feroz animal
Susurra su dulce trino
Detiene a los peregrinos
Libera a los prisioneros
El amor con sus esmeros
Al viejo lo vuelve niño
Y al malo solo el cariño
Lo vuelve puro y sincero

De par en par en la ventana
Se abrió como por encanto
Entró el amor con su manto
Como una tibia mañana
Al son de su bella diana
Hizo brotar el jazmín
Volando cual serafín
Al cielo le puso aretes
Y mis años en diecisiete
Los convirtió el querubín",Volver a Los 17

Pushing poems at the urban silence
Drawing portraits of the passers-by
Sitting on the curb
Combining traffic sounds
Getting dirty looks and dirty jeans
On the dirty ground

Ani DiFranco,"I'm imagining your frame
Every angle and every plane
I'm imagining your smell
The one that mingled with mine

Once upon a time thoughts of you
Are picketing my brain
They refuse to work
Such long hours without rest
In unstable conditions at best

They're out there every day
Holding up there signs
And thoughts of no other man but you
Could possibly get through
The picket lines to enter into my mind

I'm imagining your laugh again
The one you save for your family
And your very close friends
I'm imagining the way you say my name
I don't know when

I'm going to hear it again
My friends can't tell
My laughter from my cries
Someone tell this photograph of you
To let go of my eyes

I'm imagining your frame
I'm imagining your smell
I'm imagining your laugh again
And the way you say my name
",Every Angle
Ani DiFranco,"I am letting the telephone ring
'Cause I don't want to know why
I don't want to hear you explain
I don't want to hear you cry

I have written so much about you
So much I thought I knew
Words like water used to flow
Now what could I possibly have to say?

She is someone I don't even know
And all the things that you've given to me
I see now were simply reparations
They were gifts of your guilt

They were my preparation
I know I should be mature
Keep my feet on the floor
But for some reason

I just don't want them anymore
I know this shouldn't be important
Compared to you and I
But I can still hear my questions
And I can still hear you
I can still hear you lie

Now vicariously I have her in me
I want to peel off my skin
Let the water wash in
You always said that I was hiding
That I was hiding from you

But you are capable of things I could not do
You are capable of things I could not do
I remember how you pretended
How you pretended to touch me

I remember how I couldn't bring myself
To believe, I remember wondering
What was wrong? What was wrong?
How could I be so naive? How could I be so naive?

She shivers shifts from a walk to a trot
Alone in the city infested with faces
Immune to new friendships

Interested in places she's never seen
She says everything is gray here
And nothing is green

Sixteen, seventeen years old
You can smell them getting pregnant
You can hear their rock and roll

That's America you have to be tough
Like a glad trash bag the government's an old nag
With a good pedigree but pedigree's don't help you and me
I see the precedent is gray here and nothing is green

Unless something unforeseen happens
I'm surrounded by the haves
They say I can have some too
Just because of what I do

Do they think a lot about those who have not
Or does it just distract them from what they do
Most of us have gray
Except for those who can pay for green

I'm torn, I'm torn, rejecting outfits offered me
Regretting things I've worn
When I was still playing roles to fill holes
In my conception of who I am

You know, now I understand
It's not important to be defined
It's only important to use your time well
Well, time is something nobody can buy

And nobody can sell you
So don't let anybody tell you they have the advantage
Because all the gray people can say every day
Doesn't mean anything if your mind is green

This street is not a market
And I am not a commodity

Don't you find it sad that we can't even say hello

And the sun is getting low
There are some places that I can't go

As a woman I can't go there
And as a person I don't care
I don't go for the 'Hey baby, what's your name?'

I am up again against the skin of my guitar
In the window of my life looking out through the bars
I am sounding out the silence avoiding all the words
I'm afraid I've said too much, I'm afraid of who has heard me

My father, he told me the story and it was true for his time
But now the story's different, maybe I should tell him mine
All the girls line up here, all the boys on the other side
I see your ranks are advancing, I see mine are left behind

I am up again against the skin of my guitar
In the window of my life looking out through the bars
I am sounding out the silence avoiding all the words
I'm afraid I can never say enough, I'm afraid no one has heard me

And despite all the balls that I've been thrown
And forced to drop on the social totem pole
I'm preciously close to the top

Of someone much further away
We shared a brief bus stop
On one of those in-between days

She gave me her smile

At the lipstick on her teeth

She asked me for a light
And if I thought her hair looked okay
We grew out of the small talk
Into stuff strangers just don't say

We discovered we are both
Pleasantly furious half of the time
When we're not just toeing the line

We sat underneath the shelter
As the rain came down outside
The bench was cold
Against the underside of our thighs
I said I think we need new responses
Each question's a revolving door
And she said, yeah,
My life may not be something special
But it's never been lived before

We decided our urgency will wane
When we grow old
And there will be a new generation of anger
New stories to be told

As I was trying to get some sleep
'cause an officer came by anyway
And told me I had to leave

[Chorus]
And every state line
There's a new set of laws
And every police man
Comes equipped with extended claws
There's a thousand shades of white
And a thousand shades of black
But the same rule always applies
Smile pretty, and watch your back",Every State Line
Ani DiFranco,"She's looking in the mirror
She's fixing her hair
And I touch my head to feel
What isn't there
She's humming a melody
We learned in grade school
She's so happy
And I think
This is not cool
Cause I know the guy
She's been talking about
I have met him before
And I think
What is this beautiful beautiful woman
Settling for?

She bends her breath
When she talks to him
I can see her features begin to blur
As she pours herself
Into the mold he made for her
And for everything he does
She has a way to rationalize
She says he don't mean what he do
She tells me he called
To apologize

He says he loves her
He says he's changing
And he can keep her warm
And so she sits there like America
Suffering through slow reform
But she'll never get back the time
And the years sneak by
One by one
She is still playing the martyr
I am still praying for revolution

And she still doesn't have what she deserves
But she wakes up smiling every day
She never really expected more
That's just not the way we are raised
And I say to her,
You know,
There's plenty of really great men out there
But she doesn't hear me
She's looking in the mirror
She's fixing her hair",Fixing Her Hair
Ani DiFranco,"It was good
Good to see you again
Good to meet your girlfriend
I'll try not to wonder where you are
When you go outside to kiss her
In the front seat of your car

It is good
Good to be back home
How I missed this time zone
Strangers are exciting
Their mystery never ends
But there's nothing like looking at your own history
In the faces of your friends

And it's bad
To have eyes like neon signs
Flashing open open open
Open open open open open
Open all the time
And it's bad
That I wrapped you in a fantasy
And I carry you with me
But lately it seems like everybody's
Joined at the hip 
And I'm still fancy
I'm so fancy
Fancy free

Sometimes the beauty is easy
Sometimes you don't have to try at all
Sometimes you can hear the wind blow in a handshake
Sometimes there's poetry written right
On the bathroom wall

And it's bad
That I took that second look
I guess I'm an open book
You know I didn't really intend
To embrace you that long
But then again I wasn't the only one
Holding on","Good, Bad, Ugly"
Ani DiFranco,"You think I wouldn't have him
Unless I could have him by the balls
You think I just dish it out
You don't think I take it at all
You think I am stronger
You think I walk taller than the rest
You think I'm usually wearing the pants
Just 'cause I rarely wear a dress

Well

When you look at me
You see my purpose,
See my pride
You think I just saddle up my anger
And ride and ride and ride
You think I stand so firm
You think I sit so high on my trusty steed
Let me tell you
I'm usually face down on the ground
When there's a stampede

I'm no heroine
At least, not last time I checked
I'm too easy to roll over
I'm too easy to wreck
I just write about
What I should have done
I just sing
What I wish I could say
And hope somewhere
Some woman hears my music
And it helps her through her day

Cause some guy designed
These shoes I use to walk around
Some big man's business turns a profit
Every time I lay my money down
Some guy designed the room I'm standing in
Another built it with his own tools
Who says I like right angles?
These are not my laws
There are not my rules

I'm no heroine
I still answer to the other half of the race
I don't fool myself
Like I fool you
I don't have the power

It isn't here

She says do I know you
I say well, no, not biblically
But I've been waiting for you come
And talk to me
I have been playing
Too many of those boy girl games
She says honey you are safe here
This is a girl girl thing

I told him I loved him
So he thought I'd roll over and play dead
He was god's gift to hypocrisy
With weak knees and a big fat head
She says honey don't tell me

You are boring me
Just tell me do you like me
Tell me what you're gonna do

I crashed your pickup truck
And then I had to drive it back home
I was crying
I was so scared

Of what you would do
Of what you would say

So I started laughing along

Saying, it looks a little rough
But it runs okay
It looks a little rough
But it runs good anyway

We get a little further from perfection
Each year on the road
I guess that's what they call character
I guess that's just the way it goes

Better to be dusty than polished

To make that mistake
He just wasn't worthwhile
She's been under command
Of the wrong man
And she'll give you everything
Except the upper hand
She was his mother, and his lover,
And his wife
Now she wants the luxury
Of her own life

'cause the marriage business
Is still run by men

And they know what they know all right
But there's so much
They don't understand
What about the other sex
What about the other hand
They only know what they've been told
And they're well cast
But they don't break the mold
And good sources are not enough
So she calls their bluff
Yeah, she calls their bluff

I can see he is scarred
From doing some hard time
But I let alone what is broken
'Cause it isn't mine

He strikes out at me
When I am within reach
Then he reaches for me
When I draw the line

Sometimes it seems like love
Is just a fancy word for compromise

You gotta read between the years
You gotta write between the lines
You gotta try to understand
The grandness of the man behind the petty crimes
And let him off easy sometimes

There would be a sunset
And the camera would pan away
But the sky is just a little sister

Tagging along behind the buildings
Trying to imitate their gray
The little boys are breaking bottles
Against the sidewalk

The big boys, too
The girls are hanging out at the candy store
Pumping quarters into the phone
'Cause they don't want to go home

And I think,
What if no one's watching
What it when we're dead, we are just dead
What if it's just us down here

What if god ain't looking down
What if he's looking up instead

If my life were a movie
I would light a cigarette
And the smoke would curl around my face
Everything I do would be interesting

I'd play the good guy
In every scene
But I always feel I have to
Take a stand

And there's always someone on hand
To hate me for standing there
I always feel I have to open my mouth
And every time I do

I offend someone
Somewhere

What if when we're dead, we are just dead
What if there's no time to lose

You are just in the way

I can see him through the cracks

Where I'm from
Or why I came

Then we go back home
We cut out the small talk

The I'm-so-bored room
Listening to the suits
Talk about their world
They can make straight lines
Out of almost anything
Except for the line
Of my upper lip when it curls
Dressed in my best greasy skin
And squinty eyes
I'm the only part of summer here
That made it inside
In the air-conditioned building
Decorated with corporate flair
I wonder
Can these boys smell me bleeding
Though my underwear

There's men wearing the blood
Of the women they love
There's white wearing the blood of the brown
But every woman learns to bleed from the womb
And we bleed to renew life
Every time it's cut down
I got my vertebrae all stacked up
As high as they go

From the earth that I know
So I excuse myself and leave the room

But it's not a minute too soon

Words are wetter than water

I got friends in other countries too

I got lovers whose eyes
I've only seen at a glance

And I am watching your chest

Like the tides of my life

And your bones have been my bed frame 
And your flesh has been my pillow 
And I've been waiting for sleep 
To offer up the deep 
With both hands 
Oh, with both hands 

And in each other's shadow 
We've grown less and less tall 
And eventually our theories 
Didn't explain it all

To four lips
None of which were mine
Kissing
Tightened my belt around my hips
Where your hands were missing
And stepped out into the cold
Collar high
Under the slate gray sky
The air was smoking and the streets were dry
And I wasn't joking when I said
Good bye
There were magazine quality men talking on the corner
French, no less much less of them then us
So why do I feel like something's been rearranged?
You know, taken out of context I must seem so strange

Killed a cockroach so big
It left a puddle of pus on the wall
When you and I are lying in bed
You don't seem so tall
I'm singing now because my tear ducts are too tired
And my mind is disconnected but my heart is wired
I make such a good statistic
Someone should study me now
Somebody's got to be interested in how I feel
Just 'cause I'm here
And I'm real

Substituting the conclusion to confrontation with a kiss
And oh, how I miss

Ani DiFranco,"I opened a bank account when I was nine years old
I closed it when I was eighteen
I gave them every penny that I'd saved and they gave my blood and my urine a number
And now I'm sitting in this waiting room playing with the toys
And I am here to exercise my freedom of choice
I passed their handheld signs
I went through their picket lines
They gathered when they saw me coming
They shouted when they saw me cross
I said, ""why don't you go home?
Just leave me alone
I'm just another woman lost
You are like fish in the water who don't know that they are wet
But as far as I can tell the world isn't perfect yet""
And his bored eyes were obscene
On his denim thighs a magazine
I wish he'd never come here with me
In fact I wish he'd never come near me
I wish his shoulder wasn't touching mine
I am growing older waiting in this line
But some of life's best lessons are learned at the worst times
And under the fierce fluorescent she offered her hand for me to hold
She offered stability and calm and I was crushing her palm
Through the pinch-pull wincing
My smile unconvincing
On that sterile battlefield that sees only casualties
Never heroes
My heart hit absolute zero
And lucille, your voice still sounds in me
Yeah mine was a relatively easy tragedy
The profile of our country looks a little less hard-nosed
But you know that picket line persisted and that clinic's since been closed
They keep pounding their fists on reality hoping it will break
But you know I don't think there's one of them that leads a life free of mistakes

The toast isn't even warm
The waitress and the man in the plaid shirt
Play out a scene they've played
So many times before
I am watching the sun stumble home in the morning
From a bar on the east side of town
And the coffee is just water dressed in brown
Beautiful but boring
He visited me yesterday
He noticed my fingers
And asked me if I would play
I didn't really care a lot
But I couldn't think of a reason why not
I said if you don't come any closer I don't mind if you stay
My thighs have been involved in many accidents
And now I can't get insured
And I don't need to be lured by you

And now you don't have to ask
Because you know how I feel
You know how I feel

But my definition ends there
And it doesn't seem fair
That I'm living for something I can't even define
There you are right there
In the meantime

I don't want to play for you anymore

I want my old face
I want my old mind

Ani DiFranco,"Rush hour and the day's dawning
The rain came and pushed me under the awning
The puddles grew and threw themselves at me
With every passing car I'm shielding my guitar
And there were some things I did not tell him
There were certain things he did not need to know
And there were some days I did not love him
He didn't understand me and I did not know why I didn't go
He said, ""change the channel. I've got problems of 
My own. I am sick of hearing about  
AIDS and people without homes.""
And I said, "" well, Id like to sympathize with 
That, but if you don't understand, then how can you act?""
I expect summer to be there in the morning.
I woke to the alarm, but she was out of arms 
Reach, sneaking out on silent thighs.
That were spent and sore from the hot nights that came before
He said, ""I looked at you. I don't know why.""
I said, ""I was wearing black so you couldn't see 
Me against the sky.""
Take your big leather boots, and  your buckles,   
And your chains, put them on a downtown train
I expect he would be there in the morning

I awoke to the alarm
He was still in arm's reach,
But his body was just a disguise
His mind had wondered off long ago
I could tell by his eyes

A building settling around me
My figure female framed crookedly
In the threshold
Of the room
Door scraping floorboards
With every opening
Carving a rough history
Of bedroom scenes
The plot hard to follow
The text obscured
In the folds of sheets
Slowly gathering the stains
Of seasons spent lying there
Red and brown
Like leaves fallen
The colors of an eternal cycle
Fading with the 
Wash cycle
And the rinse cycle
Again an unfamiliar smell
Like my name misspelled
Or misspoken
A cycle broken
The sound of them strong
Stalking talking about their prey
Like the way hammer meets nail
Pounding, they say
Pounding out the rhythms of attraction
Like a woman was a drum like a body was a weapon
Like there was something more they wanted
Than the journey
Like it was owed to them
Steel toed they walk
And I'm wondering why this fear of men
Maybe it's because I'm hungry
And like a baby I'm dependent on them
To feed me
I am a work in progress
Dressed in the fabric of a world unfolding
Offering me intricate patterns of questions
Rhythms that never come clean
And strengths that you still haven't seen",The Slant

'Cause my tone was curt.
Yeah and when I'm approached in a dark alley,
I don't lift my skirt.
In the city, self-preservation is a full time occupation.
I'm determined to survive on this shore. 
You know I don't avert my eyes anymore.
In a man's world, I am a woman by birth.  
And after nineteen times around, 
I have found they will stop what you are worth.

And I was blessed with a birth and a death,
And I guess I just wanted some say in between.

Ani DiFranco,"I want somebody who sees the pointlessness
And still keeps their purpose in mind
I want somebody who has a tortured soul
Some of the time
I want somebody who will either put out for me
Or put me out of misery
Or maybe just put it all to words
And make me go, you know
I never heard it put that way
Make me say, what did you just say?

I want somebody who can hold my interest
Hold it and never let it go
Someone who can flatten me with a kiss
That hits like a fist
Or a sentence, that stops me like a brick wall
If you hear me talking

Listen to what I'm not saying
If you hear me playing guitar
Listen to what I'm not playing
And don't ask me to put words
To all the silences I wrote
Don't ask me to put words
To all the spaces between notes
In fact if you have to ask, forget it
Do and you'll regret it
I'm tired of being the interesting one
I'm tired of having fun for two
Just lay yourself on the line
And I might lay myself down by you
But don't sit behind your eyes
And wait for me to surprise you
I want somebody who can make me
Scream until it's funny
Give me a run for my money
I want someone who can
Twist me up in knots
Tell me, for the woman who has everything
What have you got?
I want someone who's not afraid of me
Or anyone else
In other words I want someone
Who's not afraid of them self

Sits in his 37th floor suite
And swivels to gaze down
At the city he made me in
He allows me to stand and
Solicit graffiti until
He needs the land I stand on
In my darkened threshold
Am pawing through my pockets
The receipts, the bus schedules
The matchbook phone numbers
The urgent napkin poems
All of which laundering has rendered
Pulpy and strange
Loose change and a key

Go ahead, ask me if I care
I got the answer here
I wrote it down somewhere
I just gotta find it
I just gotta find it

Somebody came on too heavy

I was caught caring,
Bearing weight

might not be justice to me

so no one person ever has to have blood on their hands
we've got complex organizations
and if everyone just does their job
no one person has to understand

you might be too poor

Holding my face over the steam

How could you take almost everything

How could you beg me to stay
Reach out your hands and plead
And then pack up your eyes and run away

Away so slowly

In Vegas

And now I'm tired
And I am broke

And I feel stupid and I feel used
And I'm at the end of my little rope
And I am swinging back and forth

And the closed door on the first floor
She's listening through the air shaft
To see how long our swan song can last

I am drawing the story of how hard we tried, how hard we tried

And I am watching your chest
I am watching your chest rise and fall
Like the tides of my life and the rest of it all

And your bones have been my bed frame
And your flesh has been my pillow
I've waiting for sleep to offer up the deep
With both hands, with both hands

In each other's shadows we grew less and less tall
And eventually our theories couldn't explain it all
And I'm recording our history now on the bedroom wall
And when we leave the landlord will come and paint over it all

Ani DiFranco,"Me and all the kids from the neighborhood
We'd play out in the street all summer long.
Rule was we had to go home at night, 
When the street lights came on.
We were oblivious to the rest of the world.
And we'd hold up the cars in the street.
Yeah, we'd always play boys against girls, 
And both sides would cheat.

Strange men would stop their cars at the curb
Say: ""Hey sweetheart come here."",
And I'd go up to the window and they'd have their dick out in their hand 
With a sick little sneer.
And I'd say 
""Here we go again! Yeah, ok this time you win."" 
And I would feel dirty, I'd feel ashamed,
But I wouldn't let it stop my game.
We would play hide and go seek.
Territory would be the whole block.
Sometimes the older boys when they'd find you,
They wouldn't want to tag you, they'd just want to talk.
They'd say ""What would you do for a quarter? Come on, we don't have that much time.""
And I'd think a minute and I'd say: 
""Ok...give me the quarter first. Fine.""
This time you win.
Here we go again!
And I would feel dirty and I would feel ashamed,
But I wouldn't let it stop my game.
I remember my first trip alone on the greyhound bus,
And the man who put his hands on me to see where his knife fell 
And I remember when I left how excited I was
And I remember when I arrived I didn't feel so well.
I remember the teacher at school got me so sick and scared
I went into the bathroom and threw up in my hair
And I could go on, but you know, it just gets worse
So I think I'll stop there...

But be careful getting coffee 
I think these people want to shoot us 
Or maybe there's some kinda local competition here 
To see who can be the rudest 

People talk 
About my image 
Like I come in two dimensions 
Like lipstick is a sign of my declining mind 
Like what I happen to be wearing 
The day that someone takes a picture 
Is my new statement for all of womankind 
I wish they could see us now 

In leather bras and rubber shorts 
Like some ridiculous new team uniform 
For some ridiculous new sport 
Quick someone call the girl police 
And file a report 

In a coffee shop in a city 
Which is every coffee shop in every city 
On a day which is every day",Little Plastic Castle

you always got those dark sunglasses 
covering half your face 
but if you promise to take them off 
i promise i won't squander your gaze 
i will be picturesque 
i will be nice 
i won't do anything 
you can't tell your wife 
i will think before i act 
i will think twice 
just let me see your eyes 
each time we've spoken 
we've put in our token 
and ridden the tilt-a-whirl 
i was giggling and dizzy 
flirting like a twelve year old girl 
the carnival of you and me 
is coming to town 
watch how we spin and spin 
and then fall down 
now we just say hello 
and head for firmer ground 
you are the one-way glass 
that watches me 
standing in line at the bank 
i always looked into your glasses 
like a cat looks into a fish tank 
but all i could ever see 
was the specter of me reflected 
i want a monument of the friendship 
that we never had, erected 
i want to take up lots of room 
i want it to loom 
you always got those dark sunglasses 
between us when we talk 
but after the party is over 
if you want to take a walk 
we could just look around 
not do nothing wrong 
just try to be at least as brave as our songs 
i will bring my heart 
i will bring my face 
you name the time and place

Maybe you didn't get enough sleep 
Well, nobody likes their job 

Nobody got enough sleep 
Maybe you just had 
The worst day of your life 
But, you know, there's no escape 

And there's no excuse

Playing at death 

Banishing their cold cuts 
With their ghostly makeup 
And their heroin breath 
And all the little fishes are flapping wildly 

On their hooks 
While all the top critics find great meaning 
In the telephone book 
The little emperor he has no clothes 

So he can't come out to play 
And besides which life is suffering 
And he likes it that way 
And the little guy is not so friendly 

But you know life has been cruel 
So wipe that smile off your face, baby

Of being studiously aloof 
Like life is just a boring chore 
And I am living proof 

I could join forces with an army 
Or ornery hipsters

Ani DiFranco,"You crawled into my bed
Like some sort of giant insect
And I found myself spellbound
At the sight of you there

Cocooned in my room,
Beautiful and grotesque and all the rest of that bug stuff
Bluffing your way into my mouth
Behind my teeth, reaching for my scars

That night we got kicked out of two bars
And laughed our way home

That night you leaned over
And threw up into your hair
And I thought
I would offer you my pulse

If I thought it would be useful
I would give you my breath
Except
The problem with death is that you have

Some hundred years and then they can
Build building on your only bones
100 years and then your grave is not your own
We lie in out beds, and our graves

Unable to save ourselves from
The quaint tragedies we invent
And then undo from the stupid circumstances
We slalomed through

And I realized that night that the hall light 
Which seemed so bright when you turned it on is nothing
Compared to the dawn
Which is nothing, compared to the light 

Which seeps from me while you're sleeping 
Cocooned in my room
Beautiful and grotesque resting 
That night we got kicked out of two bars

And laughed our way home
And I held you there thinking

I would offer you my pulse
I would give you my breath

Feels like a little baby bird 
Fallen from the nest 
I think that your body is something I understand 

I think that I'm happy 
I think that I'm blessed 
But I've had a lack of inhibition 
I've had a loss of perspective 

I've had a little bit to drink 
And it's making me think 
That I can jump ship and swim 
That the ocean will hold me 

That there's got to be more 
Than this boat I'm in 
They can call me crazy if I fall 
All the chance I need 

Is one-in-a-million 
And they can call me brilliant 
If I succeed 
Gravity is nothing to me 

I'm moving at the speed of sound 
I'm just gonna get my feet wet 
Until I drown 
I teeter between tired 

And really, really tired 
I'm wiped out and I'm wired 
But I guess that's just as well 
'Cause I've built my own empire 

Out of car tires and chicken wire 
And now I'm queen of my own compost heap 
And I'm getting used to the smell 
I've had a lack of information 

I've had a little revelation 
I'm climbing up on the railing 
Trying not to look down 
I'm going to do my best swan dive 

Into shark infested waters 
I'm going to pull out my tampon 
And start splashing around 
'Cause I don't care if they eat me alive 

I've got better things to do than survive 
I've got the memory of your warm skin in my hands 
And I've got a vision of blue sky and warm land 
I'm cradling the hardest, heaviest part of me in my hands 

The ship is pitching and heaving 
Our limbs are bobbing and weaving 
I think this is something I understand 
I think I need a couple vaccinations 

For my far-away vacation 
I'm gonna go ahead and go boldly 
'Cause a little bird told me 
That jumping is easy 

And falling is fun 
Right up until you hit the sidewalk 
Shivering and stunned 
They can call me crazy if I fall

you were fresh off the boat 
from virginia 
i had a year of new york city 
under my belt 
we met in a dream 
we were both nineteen 
i remember where we were standing 
i remember how it felt 
two little girls 
growing out of their training bras 
this little girl breaks furniture 
this little girl breaks laws 
two girls together 
just a little less alone 
this little girl cried wee wee wee 
all the way home 
you were always half crazy 
now look at your baby 
you make as much sense 
as a nursery rhyme 
love is a piano 
dropped from a fourth story window 
and you were in the wrong place 
at the wrong time 
and i don't like your girlfriend 
i blame her 
i never seen one of your lovers 
do you so much harm 
i loved you first 
and you know i would prefer 
if she didn't empty her syringes 
into your arm 
here comes little naked me 
padding up to the bathroom door 
to find little naked you 
slumped on the bathroom floor 
with my back against the wall 
while you distill your whole life 
down to a 911 call 
now you bring me your bruises 
so i can 'ooh' and 'aah' at the display 
maybe i'm supposed to make one of my famous jokes 
that makes everything okay 
or maybe i'm supposed to be the handsome prince 
who rides up and unties your hands 
or maybe i'm the furrow-browed friend 
who thinks she understands 
here comes little naked me 
padding up to the bathroom door 
to find little naked you 
slumped on the bathroom floor 
so i guess i'll just stand here 
with my back against the wall 
while you distill your whole life 
down to a 911 call 

",Two Little Girls
Ani DiFranco,"Gonna go out to the arrivals gate at the airport
And sit there all day
Watch people reuniting, public affection so exciting
It even makes airports okay

Watching children run with their arms outstretched
Just to throw those arms around their grandpa's necks
Watching lovers plant kisses
Old men to their misses at the arrivals gate

Watching a mother with a mother's smile
Don't tell me to move, I just wanna sit here for a while
I have determined, it's a sure cure for cancer
Watching excitement turn family dogs into dancers
At the arrivals gate, at the arrivals gate
At the arrivals gate, at the arrivals gate

I got me a white bread sandwich with some shredded lettuce
And then I got me a ringside view for my quaint little fetish
I just wanna drain my little pink heart of all its malice
And kick back for the afternoon in this fluorescent palace

Everybody's in a hurry here in purgatory except for me
I'm where I need to be, except for me
I'm where I need to be, except for me
I'm where I need to be, here at the arrivals gate

Ani DiFranco,"Back back back in the back of your mind
Are you learning an angry language
Tell me boy boy boy are you tending to your joy
Or are you just letting it vanquish
Back back back in the dark of your mind
Where the eyes of your demons are gleaming
Are you mad mad mad
About the life you never had
Even when you are dreaming

Who are these old old old people
In these nursing homes
Scowling away at nothing
Like big rag dolls just cursing at the walls 
And pulling out all of their stuffing
Ever day is a door leading back to the core
Yes, old age will distill you
And if you're this this this full of bitterness now
Some day it will just fill you

When you sit right down in the middle of yourself
You're gonna want to have a comfortable chair
So renovate your soul before you get too old 
'cause you're gonna be housebound there
When you're old you fold up like an envelope 
And you mail yourself right inside
And there's nowhere to go
Except out real slow
Are you ready, boy, for that ride?

Your arrogance is gaining on you
And so is eternity
You better practice happiness
You better practice humility
You took the air, you took the time
You were fed and you were free
Now you'd better put some beauty back
While you got the energy
You'd better put some beauty back, boy
While you got the energy",Back Back Back

Sun setting make you
If you humble yourself

How often do you reply?
How often do you wonder
About life on the other side?
On the other side of sorrow
On the other side of rage
On the other side of okay
Okay at all
In any way
Imagine what loneliness
Will drive someone to do
Now multiply that times me
And multiply that times you
Now imagine what it would take to make this all happen again
And just when you think you're gonna cry
Multiply that times ten

Are distracting me

When you asked do you have a light?
I've been wondering where you went
When you left that party that night

Cloud blood smudge smeared on the sky
Its dawns roadkill
I've been driving since midnight
And I'm driving still

Stop on the top of the ridge
Just to feel the wind on my rand mcnally
Then I feel the air grow cold
As I drift in to the first blue of the valley

And you're wondering how far down you are on my
Call back list
But you don't realize
Everytime I find I'm by a phone the landscape shifts

Every other song someones trying to write
Angels into the world
Every grace every ace every near miss
Every decent kiss by a pretty girl

She was an angel
She looked like an angel

And all of the angels did sing
And the angels were watching
And the angels were listening
And the angels were on hand to stand in for everything

You can call it magic
When a man pulls a rabbit out of a hat
But the reason I don't call 
Is 'cause I wonder if there isn't a better word than that

And you can call me crazy
But I think you're as lazy as white paint on the wall
And I know you'll only speak to me in dial tones
If I call

Its been way too long 
Since I've been behind the wheel
Headlights guiding me right through the dark
I feel

Into the overcast skies
Over my home town

What is it about Birmingham?
What is it about Buffalo?

Did the hate filled want to build bunkers
In your beautiful red earth
They want to build them in our shiny white snow
And now I've drawn closed the curtains
In this little booth 
Where the truth has no place to stand
And I am feeling oh so powerless

Through the kitchen window
Just one or two miles from here
If you fly like a crow

In his one safe place

A bullet ensuring the right to life
Whizzed past his kid and his wife
And knocked his glasses right off of his face

And the blood poured off the pulpit
Yeah the blood poured down the picket lines
And the hatred was immediate, yeah
And the vengeance was divine

So they went and stuffed God down the barrel of a gun
And after him they stuffed his only son

From back when life was more soft shelled

Letters littered with little lewd pictures
Drawn by the ghost of Woody Guthrie
Who would use your big thick hand
Just to draw one two for me
And I think of your letters as love letters
Which is how I think of songs
In that it is the writing of these things
That tend to carry us along

The stars or the street lights.

No more ""Wish I may"" no more ""Wish I might"".
It takes a stiff upper lip just to hold up my face
I gotta suck it up and savor the taste of my own behavior.

Faster than a roulette wheel

To undo everything they've done to you
Undo everything they've done to you

And I'm trying to see through the glare
Yes, I'm struggling just to see what is there

The one person who really knows me best, says I'm like a cat
The kind of cat that you can't pick up and throw into your lap
No, the kind that doesn't mind being held only when it's her idea

Yeah, the kind that feels what she decides to feel
When she's good and ready to feel it

Now I am prowling through the backyard
And I am hiding under the car
I have gotten out of everything, I've gotten into so far

I eat when I am hungry and I travel alone
And just outside the glow of the house
Is where I feel most at home

But in the window you sometimes appear
And your music is faint in my ears

Against the world
And all my sympathies were with her
When I was a little girl
But now I've seen both my parents
Play out the hands they were dealt

I know more about how my father must have felt

That I know what all the fighting was for
And I just want you to understand
That I'm not angry anymore

But without all the acceptance and getting by
That got my father through

To compensate
For the lack of light from above

Holding a hat-shaped hat
He held up two fingers and said 'how many fingers? ""
And I said 'peace man, that's where it's at""
I said you are what you do in order to
Prevent becoming what you're busy not doing
And if you do do it truly
Then you arrive at it newly
Then in the end you are absolved
And the problem of heaven is solved

And the man broke into a smile,
Like he was breaking into a song
And he was broken and smiling
And I was singing along
And we agreed completely agreetly about most things
'til the sun set sweetly
Like it does in those paintings
The ones they hang in hotel rooms
The ones they bolt to the wall
As though anyone would want to steal them at all

We talked like children without breathing
'til I stopped this lady as she was leaving
And I said 'excuse me,
But do you know what time it would be
If we were on mars ? '

Like a crossing guard stopping the cars
And she said

Ani DiFranco,"In the jukebox of her memory
The list of names flips by and stops
She closes her eyes
And smiles as the record drops

Then she drinks herself up and out
Of her kitchen chair and she dances out of time
As slow as she can sway for as long as she can say
This dance is mine, this dance is mine

Her hair bears silent witness
To the passing of time
Tattoos like mile markers
Map the distance she has gone

Winning some, losing some, she says
My sister still calls every Sunday night
After the rates go down and I can
Never manage to say anything right

My whole life blew up
And now it's all coming down

And she says leave me alone
Tonight I just wanna stay home
She fills the pot with water
She drops in the bone

She says, I've got a darkness
That I have to feed, I've got a sadness
That grows up around me like a weed
And I'm not hurting anyone

I'm just spiraling in
As she closes her eyes
And hears the song begin again

She appreciates the phone calls
The consoling cards and such
She appreciates all the people
Who come by and try to pull her back in touch

They try to hold the lid down tightly
And they try to shake well
But the oil and water
Just want to separate themselves

She drinks herself up and out of her
Kitchen chair and she dances out of time
As slow as she can sway for as long as she can say

This dance is mine

Ani DiFranco,"It's not so much that we got closer
It's that her face just got bigger
And by the time it was taking up my whole view
I figured my face had got bigger too

So I used it to try and sway her
Say something to her
Make my case but my face
Never had a chance

All along it was the wrong song and dance
I just stood there without even a stance
Helpless to her advance and her retreat
Backspace, delete

It wasn't so much that we fell in love
As my life just seemed to come down
To a slow walk on a straight line
Between her smile and her frown

And maybe we never were as close
As we should have been

Ani DiFranco,"You cease to smell the steel plant
After you've lived there for a while
Smoke is snow is ash are leaves that blow
Through the air aloft
All our houses dim their sliding
To the same soot gray style
And we hang our laundry out on Sundays
When they turn the furnaces off

Everybody's daddy works up on the line
The Stienbrenners and the Wilczewskis
Have been there the longest time
And everybody's mommy squints into the sun
Sunday afternoon after all the laundry's done

And sometimes a distant siren
Can set a dog to barking late at night
Then it dominoes on down
Till every dog is joining in
The first rumors of the lay offs
Sang like a distant siren might
And we all perked up our ears
And paced the fence of the ensuing din

And every night, we were glued to the TV news
At six o'clock
'cause it was hard to tell what was real
And what was talk
They explained about the cutbacks
All the earnest frowns
What they didn't say was that the plant
Was slowly shutting down

This town is not the kind of place
That money people go
They make their jokes up on the TV
About all the snow
And they're building condos downriver
From where the plant had been
But nobody really lives here
Now that the air is clean

And the president assured us
It was all gonna trickle down
Like it'd be raining so much money
That we'd be sad to see the sun

Out in Denver, so they left Denver
Everybody knows they were the lucky ones

Spire of the steeple
But God's work isn't done by God
It's done by people

Fingers of the trees
The lumberjacks with their bloody axes
Are on their knees

And just when you think that you've got enough
Enough grows
And everywhere that you go in life
Enough knows

Up, up, up, up, up, up dances
The steam from the sewer
As she rounds the corner
The brutal wind blows right through her

Up, up, up, up, up, up raises
The stakes of the game
Each day sinks its bootprints into her clay
And she's not the same

And just when you think that you've got enough
Enough grows
And everywhere that you go in life
Enough knows

Half of learning how to play
Is learning what not to play
And she's learning the spaces she leaves
Have their own things to say

Then she's trying to sing just enough
So that the air around her moves
And make music like mercy
That gives what it is and has nothing to prove

She crawls out on a limb
And begins to build her home
And it's enough just to look around
To know she's not alone

Ani DiFranco,"Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
Cries out, ""My God, they killed them all""

Here comes the story of the hurricane
The man, the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world

Three bodies lyin' there, does Patty see?
And another man named Bello, movin' around mysteriously
""I didn't do it,"" he says, and he throws up his hands
""I was only robbin' the register, I hope you understand

I saw them leavin'"" he says, and he stops
""One of us had better call up the cops""
And so Patty calls the cops
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin'
In the hot New Jersey night

Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road

Just like the time before and the time before that
In Paterson that's just the way things go
If you're black you might as well not show up on the street
'Less you wanna draw the heat

Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin' around
He said, ""I saw two men runnin' out, they looked like middleweights
They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates""

And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
Cop said, ""Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead""
So they took him to the infirmary
And though this man could hardly see
They told him that he could identify the guilty men

Four in the mornin' and they haul Rubin in
Take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs
The wounded man looks up through his one dyin' eye
Says, ""Wha'd you bring him in here for? He ain't the guy""

Yes, here's the story of the hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world

Four months later, the ghettos are in flame
Rubin's in South America, fightin' for his name
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
And the cops are puttin' the screws to him
Lookin' for somebody to blame

""Remember that murder that happened in a bar?""
""Remember you said you saw the getaway car?""
""You think you'd like to play ball with the law?""
""Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin' that night?""
""Don't forget that you are white""

Arthur Dexter Bradley said, ""I'm really not sure""
Cops said, ""A poor boy like you could use a break
We got you for the motel job and we're talkin' to your friend Bello
Now you don't wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow

You'll be doin' society a favor
That sonofabitch is brave and gettin' braver
We want to put his ass in stir
We want to pin this triple murder on him
He ain't no gentleman Jim""

Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
But he never did like to talk about it all that much
It's my work, he'd say, and I do it for pay
And when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way

Up to some paradise
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And ride a horse along a trail
But then they took him to the jailhouse
Where they try to turn a man into a mouse

All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum

And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
And though they could not produce the gun
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
And the all-white jury agreed

Rubin Carter was falsely tried
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride

How can the life of such a man
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
To see him obviously framed
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land
Where justice is a game

Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
An innocent man in a living hell

That's the story of the hurricane
But it won't be over till they clear his name
And give him back the time he's done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been

Off to make the news and the women in the middle are learning
What poor women have always known, that the edge is closer

Yeah, it may take some doing to see this undoing through

Open fire on Hollywood, open fire on MTV, open fire on NBC
And CBS and ABC, open fire on the NRA and all the lies they told us
Along the way, open fire on each weapons manufacturer

Ani DiFranco,"imagine that i am onstage

and somebody right now is yawning
and watching me like a tv
and i've been frantically piling up sandbags
against the flood waters of fatigue and insecurity

then suddenly i hear my guitar singing
and so i just start singing along
and somewhere in my chest
all the noise just gets crushed by the song

imagine that i'm at your mercy
imagine that you are at mine
pretend i've been standing here
watching you watching me
all this time
now imagine that you are the weather
in the tiny snow globe of this song
and i am the statue of liberty
one inch long

Ani DiFranco,"The answer came
Like a shot in the back
While you were running from your lesson
Which might explain
Why years later all you could remember
Was the terror of the question
Plus, you weren't listening
You were stockpiling canned goods
Making a bomb shelter of our basement
And I can't believe you let the moral go by
While you were soaking in the product placement

Where was your conscience?
Where was your consciousness?
And where did you put all those letters
That you wrote to yourself
But could not address?

I'm a good kisser
And you're a fast learner
And that kinda thing could float us
For a pretty long time
Then one day you'd realize
You've memorized my phone number
And you'll call it and find
It's a disconnected line
'cause I got tossed out the window of love's el camino
And I shattered into a shower of sparks on the curb
You were smoking me
Weren't you?
Between your yellow fingers
You just inhaled and exhaled without saying a word

Where was your conscience?
Where was your consciousness?
And where did you put all those letters
That you wrote to yourself
But could not address?

There's a smorgasbord of unspoken poisons
A whole childhood of potions
That are all bottled up
And so one by one I am dusting off labels
I am uncorking bottles and filling up cups
So go ahead and have a taste of your own medicine
And I'll have a taste of mine
But first let's toast to the lists
That we hold in our fists
Of the things that we promise to do
Differently next time

'cause the answer came like a shot in the back
While you were running from your lesson
Which might explain
Why years later all you could remember
Was the terror of the question
Plus I'm not listening to you anymore
My head is too sore and my heart's perforated
And I'm mired in the marrow of my (well, ain't that) funny bone

and waits until we all say amen

and you play 'til you lose

again and again and they all look the same

and you find your whole family's at war
and there's this ominous silence just waiting to be broken
and there's secret places for hiding underneath the floorboards

she's bent over from the business

putting out fires

compares the weight of two beauties
the gravity of duties

And put up houses on little loop-dee-loop streets
And while america gets its heart cut right out of its chest
The Berlin wall still runs down main street
Separating east side from west
And nothing is stirring, not even a mouse
In the boarded-up stores and the broken-down houses
So they hang colorful banners off all the street lamps
Just to prove they got no manners
No mercy and no sense

And I'm wondering what it will take
For my city to rise
First we admit our mistakes
Then we open our eyes
The ghosts of old buildings are haunting parking lots
In the city of good neighbors that history forgot

I remember the first time I saw someone
Lying on the cold street
I thought: I can't just walk past here
This can't just be true
But I learned by example
To just keep moving my feet
It's amazing the things that we all learn to do

So we're led by denial like lambs to the slaughter
Serving empires of style and carbonated sugar water
And the old farm road's a four-lane that leads to the mall
And our dreams are all guillotines waiting to fall

Ani DiFranco,"Yes, 
Us people are just poems 
We're ninety percent metaphor 
With a leanness of meaning 
Approaching hyper-distillation 
And once upon a time 
We were moonshine 
Rushing down the throat of a giraffe 
Yes, rushing down the long hallway 
Despite what the p.a. announcement says 
Yes, rushing down the long hall
Down the long stairs 
In a building so tall 
That it will always be there 
Yes, it's part of a pair 
There on the bow of Noah's ark 
The most prestigious couple 
Just kickin' back parked 
Against a perfectly blue sky 
On a morning beatific 
In its Indian summer breeze 
On the day that America 
Fell to its knees 
After strutting around for a century 
Without saying thank you 
Or please 

And the shock was subsonic 
And the smoke was deafening 
Between the setup and the punch line 
Cause we were all on time for work that day 
We all boarded that plane for to fly 
And then while the fires were raging 
We all climbed up on the window sill 
And then we all held hands 
And jumped into the sky 

And every borough looked up when it heard the first blast 
And then every dumb action movie was summarily surpassed 
And the exodus uptown by foot and motorcar 
Looked more like war than anything I've seen so far 
So far 
So far 
So fierce and ingenious 
A poetic specter so far gone 
That every jackass newscaster was struck dumb and stumbling 
Over 'oh my god' and 'this is unbelievable' and on and on 
And I'll tell you what, while we're at it 
You can keep the pentagon 
Keep the propaganda 
Keep each and every tv 
That's been trying to convince me 
To participate 
In some prep school punk's plan to perpetuate retribution 
Perpetuate retribution 
Even as the blue toxic smoke of our lesson in retribution 
Is still hanging in the air 
And there's ash on our shoes 
And there's ash in our hair 
And there's a fine silt on every mantle 
From hell's kitchen to Brooklyn 
And the streets are full of stories 
Sudden twists and near misses 
And soon every open bar is crammed to the rafters 
With tales of narrowly averted disasters 
And the whiskey is flowin' 
Like never before 
As all over the country 
Folks just shake their heads 
And pour 

So here's a toast to all the folks that live in Palestine, Afghanistan, 
Iraq, El Salvador 

Here's a toast to the folks living on the pine ridge reservation 
Under the stone cold gaze of Mt. Rushmore 

Here's a toast to all those nurses and doctors 
Who daily provide women with a choice 
Who stand down a threat the size of Oklahoma City 
Just to listen to a young woman's voice 

Here's a toast to all the folks on death row right now 
Awaiting the executioner's guillotine 
Who are shackled there with dread and can only escape into their heads 
To find peace in the form of a dream, peace in the form of a dream

Cause take away our PlayStations 
And we are a third world nation 
Under the thumb of some blue blood royal son 
Who stole the oval office and that phony election 
I mean 
It don't take a weatherman 
To look around and see the weather 
Jeb said he'd deliver Florida, folks 
And boy did he ever 

And we hold these truths to be self evident: 
Number one, George W. Bush is not president 
Number two, America is not a true democracy 
Number three, the media is not fooling me 
Cause I am a poem heeding hyper-distillation 
I've got no room for a lie so verbose 
I'm looking out over my whole human family 
And I'm raising my glass in a toast 

Here's to our last drink of fossil fuels 
May we vow to get off of this sauce 
Shoo away the swarms of commuter planes 
And find that train ticket we lost 
Cause once upon a time the line followed the river 
And peeked into all the backyards 
And the laundry was waving 
The graffiti was teasing us 
From brick walls and bridges 
We were rolling over ridges 
Through valleys 
Under stars 
I dream of touring like Duke Ellington 
In my own railroad car 
I dream of waiting on the tall blond wooden benches 
In a grand station aglow with grace 
And then standing out on the platform 
And feeling the air on my face 

Give back the night its distant whistle 
Give the darkness back its soul 
Give the big oil companies the finger finally 
And relearn how to rock-n-roll 
Yes, the lessons are all around us and the truth is waiting there 
So it's time to pick through the rubble, clean the streets 
And clear the air 
Get our government to pull its big dick out of the sand 
Of someone else's desert 
Put it back in its pants 
And quit the hypocritical chants of 
Freedom forever 

Cause when one lone phone rang 
In two thousand and one 
At ten after nine 
On nine one one 
Which is the number we all called 
When that lone phone rang right off the wall 
Right off our desk and down the long hall 
Down the long stairs 
In a building so tall 
That the whole world turned 
Just to watch it fall 

And while we're at it 
Remember the first time around? 
The bomb? 
The Ryder truck? 
The parking garage? 
The princess that didn't even feel the pea? 
Remember joking around in our apartment on Avenue D? 

Can you imagine how many paper coffee cups would have to change their design 
Following a fantastical reversal of the New York skyline?! 

It was a joke 
At the time 
And that was just a few years ago 
So let the record show 
That the FBI was all over that case 
That the plot was obvious and in everybody's face 
And scoping that scene 
Religiously 
The CIA 
Or is it KGB? 
Committing countless crimes against humanity 
With this kind of eventuality 
As its excuse 
For abuse after expensive abuse 
And it didn't have a clue 
Look, another window to see through 
Way up here 
On the hundredth and fourth floor 
Look 
Another key 
Another door 
Ten percent literal 
Ninety percent metaphor 
Three thousand some poems disguised as people 
On an almost too perfect day 
Must be more than pawns 
In some asshole's passion play 
So now it's your job 
And it's my job 
To make it that way 
To make sure they didn't die in vain

Ani DiFranco,"What's with that halo hovering
Above that thick skull
Spare me
If I do say so - I think you're covering

'Course there was nothing
Could've prepared me 

For the side effect of this dirty drug
The way you punish me and then you shrug

What's with that phone call, baby
It's like you're trying
Just trying to crush me
Do you feel stronger each time you push me, dear

Did you tell your mom you carpet bombed
Before you left here 

And is it just the side effect of this dirty drug
Or does each apology sound more like a shrug 

Are you at home now with your kitty cats
Are you just at home now with the way that you act
Do you split the rent there with all your secrets
Or do you just pretend to all your friends
They're uninvited guests

Much taller than me
And partly it's the boots but
Mostly it's my chi
And I'm becoming transfixed
With nature and my part in it
Which I believe just signifies
I'm finally waking up 

And there's this moth outside my kitchen door
She's bonkers for that bare bulb
Flying round in circles
Bashing in her exoskull
And out in the woods she navigates fine by the moon
But get her around a light bulb and she's doomed 

She is trying to evolve
She's just trying to evolve 

Now let's get talking reefer madness
Like some arrogant government can't
By any stretch of the imagination
Outlaw a plant
Yes, their supposed authority over nature
Is a dream
C'mon people
We've got to come clean 

'cause they are locking our sons
And our daughters in cages
They are taking by the thousands
Our lives from under us
It's a crash course in religious fundamentals
Now let's all go to war
Get some bang for our buck 

I am trying to evolve
I'm just trying to evolve 

Gunnin' for high score in the land of dreams
Morbid bluish-white consumers ogling luminous screens
On the trail of forgetting
Cruising without a care
The jet set won't abide by that pesky jet lag
And our lives boil down to an hour or two
When someone pulls a camera out of a bag 

And I am trying to evolve
I'm just trying to evolve 

So I walk like I'm on a mission
'cause that's the way I groove
I got more and more to do
I got less and less to prove
It took me too long to realize
That I don't take good pictures
'cause I have the kind of beauty
That moves",Evolve
Ani DiFranco,"I bet you're wondering 
If you woke up today 
Just to learn why the caged bird sings 
I bet you're wondering if the goddesses are all crazy 
Or just keeping it interesting 
Situated slightly outside society 
At odds with its odd offerings 
I bet you're teetering on the edge of sobriety 
Just to alleviate a few things

Like the fear that you're standing here 
'cause you want to be liked 
You know you need your instrument 
But does your instrument need to be miked? 

You keep imagining 
That pretty soon you will just disappear 
And thinking that one thing 
Is what saves you from your fear of being here 
Here for now 
Here for now 
Here for now

I bet you're looking for the little red x 
Next to the red arrow 
And the words 'you are here' 
I bet you're hoping that your heart will send up 
The white flag this time 
Or some sign that the coast is clear 
Yeah the moment when your heart jumps 
It's all that's happening 
And once again 
It's like the first time you've felt that shock 
Yeah the moment when your heart jumps 
It's all that's happening 
And I was right behind the door when you knocked 

Thinking maybe I'm just standing here

How noticeably bad things really are 
And then you walk past this couple arguing 
In a rolled up window parked car 

And all that gesticulated bitterness 
And all of that muffled yelling hell 
It's like it just starts wafting at you 
Like a big furry rat died inside of that wall kinda smell 

Bad dreams like this roll in like a cold front 
Thunderous thunder and lightning in tow 
And your tiny little life gets even smaller 
As you heed the heavens' mighty show 

And I don't mean heaven like godlike 
'Cause the animal I am knows very well 
That nature is our teacher and our mother 
And god is just another

You're trying not to grasp 
Not to start grasping 
At straws or sticks or stones 
You're trying to learn to just sit inside your sadness 

Even if you're sitting there alone

Swinging round two poles

And then we took down all the walls 
Packed up our expectations 
And piled em up in the hall 
Yeah we bagged our future 
And kicked it to the curb 
And then we stood there unencumbered 
And we stood there undeterred 
'cause we were done clinging 
To the things 
We were afraid to lose 
And the only thing left 
Was a breathtaking view

And I looked at you

Your face so close, it's out of focus
Way down the hallway comes the sound of your shoes
That is what I, what I think about when I think about you

If we let our love off of its leash
Do you fear, like I fear how fierce it could be?

Your headlights sweeping across my ceiling
The breadth of my smile now, the depth of my feeling
Way down in my dark life, a shaft of your light shines through
And that is what I, what I think about when I think about you

If we let our love off of its leash
Do you fear, like I fear how fierce it would be?

Against a lack of inspiration 
Against a slow leak deflation

Just a phase

To assess what I think I know

What is a guitar but a box of sound?

Every time I answer the phone 
So I play and I sing and I just let it ring 
All day when I'm at home 
A defacto choice of macro 
Or microcosmic melancholy 
But, baby, any way you slice it 
I'm thinkin I could just as soon use 
The time alone 

Yes, the goons have gone global 
And the C-E-O's are shredding files 
And the democrans and the republicrats 
Are flashing their toothy smiles 
And uncle tom is posing for a photo op 
With the oval office clan 
And uncle Sam is rigging cockfights 
In the promised land 
And that knife you stuck in my back is still there 
It pinches a little when I sigh and moan 
And these days I'm thinkin' I could just as soon use 
The time alone 

'cause all the wrong people have the power 
Of suggestion 
And the freedom of the press is meaningless 
If nobody asks a question 
I mean 
Causation by definition 
Is such a complex compilation 
Of factors 
That to even try to say why 
Is to over simplify 
But that's a far cry 
Isn't it dear? 
From acting like you're the only one there 
Unrepentantly self centered and unfair

Yes, I traded the only player that was bigger than the game 
And I can't even tell you why 
'cause you'd think I'm insane 
And that's the truth 

And the music industry mafia is pimping girl power 
Sniping off their sharp shooter singles from their styrofoam towers 
And hip hop is tied up in the back room 
With a logo stuffed in its mouth 
'cause the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house 
But then 

I'm getting away from myself 

As I get closer and closer to home 
And the difference between you and me baby
Is I get fucked up

And I must admit 
Today my inner pessimist 
Seems to have got the best of me 
We start out sugared up on cool-aid and manifest destiny 
And we memorize all the president's names 
Like little trained monkeys 
And then we're spit into the world 
So many spinny-eyed t.v. junkies 
Incapable of unravelling the military industrial mystery 
Preemptively pacified with history book history 
And I've bin around the world now 
And I can see this about america 
The mind control is steep here, man 
The myopia is deep here 

And behold 
Those that try to expose the reality 
Who really try to realize democracy 
Are shot with rubber bullets and gassed off the streets 
While the global power brokers are kept clean and discrete 
Behind a wall 
Behind a moat 
And that is all 
That's all she wrote 

And my heart beats an sss o o o sss

As long as every day is Superbowl Sunday 
And larger than life women in lingerie 
Are pouting at us from every bus stop

And big government should not stand between a man and his money

The same old line 
The confederacy used on the union 

Conjugate liberty 
Into libertarian 
And medicate it 
Associate it

We won't even know we're slaves 
On a corporate plantation

Somebody say damnation!

And the path of least resistance is what makes the river crooked 
Makes it serpentine

Is the tallest building in new york

Off your tongue

While her appetite steered 
And after that she just followed her nose

She laid down in her party dress and never got up 
Needless to say she missed the party

Ani DiFranco,"I love my country
By which I mean
I am indebted joyfully
To all the people throughout its history
Who have fought the government to make right
Where so many cunning sons and daughters
Our fore mothers and forefathers
Came singing through slaughter
Came through hell and high water 
So that we could stand here
And behold breathlessly the sight
How a raging river of tears
Cut a grand canyon of light

Yes, I've bin so many places
Flown through vast empty spaces
With stewardesses whose hands
Look much older than their faces
I've tossed so many napkins
Into that big hole in the sky
Bin at the bottom of the Atlantic
Seething in a two-ply
Looking up through all that water
And the fishes swimming by
And I don't always feel lucky
But I'm smart enough to try
'cause humility has buoyancy
And above us only sky
So I lean in
Breathe deeper that brutal burning smell
That surrounds the smoldering wreckage
That I've come to love so well
Yes, color me stunned and dazzled
By all the red white and blue flashing lights
In the American intersection
Where black crashed head on with white
Comes a melody
Comes a rhythm
A particular resonance
That is us and only us
Comes a screaming ambulance
A hand that you can trust 
Laid steady on your chest
Working for the better good
(which is good at its best)
And too, bearing witness
Like a woman bears a child:
With all her might

Born of the greatest pain
Into a grand canyon of light

I mean, no song has gone unsung here
And this joint is strung crazy tight
And people bin raising up their voices
Since it just ain't bin right
With all the righteous rage
And all the bitter spite
That will accompany us out
Of this long night
That will grab us by the hand
When we are ready to take flight
Seat back and tray table
In the upright and locked position
Shocked to tears by each new vision
Of all that my ancestors have done

Like, say, the women who gave their lives
So that I could have one

People, we are standing at ground zero
Of the feminist revolution
Yeah, it was an inside job
Stoic and sly
One we're supposed to forget 
And downplay and deny
But I think the time is nothing
If not nigh
To let the truth out
Coolest f-word ever deserves a fucking shout!
I mean 
Why can't all decent men and women
Call themselves feminists?

As I go deeper and deeper in
Til I'm so far from my shore
So far from what I came here for
I let you surround me
I let you drown me
Out with your din

I was floating above myself
Watching her do just what you wanted
Poor little friendly ghost
Wondering why her whole house feels haunted

Ani DiFranco,"The light blue flickering rhythm
Of the neighbor's big console t.v.
Is basking on the ceiling
Of another insomniac spree
And outside sleep's open window
Between the drops of rain
History is writing a recipe book
For every earthly pain

Oh to clean up the clutter of echoes
Coming in and out of focus
Words spoken
Like locusts
Sing and sing
In my head

And thing is
They often seem
In my memory's long dream
To be superfluous to 
The true story of what was

Cause 

Real is real regardless
Of what you try to say
Or say away
Real is real relentless
While words distract and dismay
Words that change their tune
Though the story remains the same
Words that fill me quickly
And then are slow to drain
Dialogues that dither down reminiscent
Of the way it likes to rain
Every screen
A smoke screen
Oh to dream
Just for a moment
The picture
Outside the frame

Then in a flash
The light blue horizon
Spanning a sudden black
Is sucked into the vanishing point
And quiet rushes back
To search for the downbeat
In a tabla symphony
To search in the darkness
For someone who looks like me

(though I'm not really who I said I was
Or who I thought I'd be)

Just a collection of recollections
Conversations consisting
Of the kind of marks we make
When we're trying to get a pen to work again

A lifetime of them!

Cough, cough, ahem

I say to me
Now here listening 
I say to the locusts
That sing and sing to me sitting
Now here on the front porch swing of my eyes:
I hereby amend
Whatever I've ever said
With this sigh",The True Story of What Was
Ani DiFranco,"There you were day after day
Six feet 
Twenty feet 
Two feet away
Right in my pocket singin' me a song
Makin' my heart race all day long

And we talked it out and we talked it down
But your eyes were not listening
And my ears were looking around
For another song to sing
But it was you each time
It was you

The answer to each moment must be yes
And the question: can you live with that?
Becomes the test
So you weigh it against that aching in your chest
And that secretly relentless emptiness

And you talk it out and you talk it down
But your eyes are not listening
And my ears are running around
Looking for another song to sing
But it is you each time
It is you

So my heart finally broke
It was so long bent
And it broke in three places 
When it finally went
It wanted only to say what it meant
So it suffered every punishment

Now it lives in a shack outside of town
And only the wolves are out there listening
And in her dreams they chase her down
Their moonlit eyes are glistening
And it is you each time
It is you",You Each Time
Ani DiFranco,"You cried and you cried and you cried wolf
So it took me a minute to understand
That you really were hurt bad 
That day you deeply cut your hand
And then that look that you gave me
Sent me rushing through guilt's door
I'd already started to feel callous 
Like I really should care more

It was my work that kept me upright
So you called it a crutch
While I drifted off 
Into dreams of such and such
And by the time we'd come full circle 
We knew exactly what to do
Just keep looking at the triangle 
Instead of what it's pointing to

But you can't will yourself happy
You can't will your cunt wet
You can't keep standing at the station 
Pretending you're being met
You can't wear a sign that says 'yours'
When that ain't what you get

It flows and flows away from me
My love is a stream
Your love is a vaudeville show
So charming and obscene
We both had our moments
We both had our fun
And then I hated to prove 'em all right
All those who said I'd run

But you can't will yourself happy

I want to tighten down on the lag time

Your consonants were buzzing 
Around your head like flies
Your true colors were showing

Tapping her toe

We are part potato bug
We know enough to go fetal

Who knew why they were here
They were happy to pay taxes
For the schools and roads
Happy to be here
They took it seriously
Just like a job of citizenry
My mother went campaigning door to door
And holding to her hand was me
Cause I was just a girl in a room full of women
Licking stamps and laughing
I remember the feeling of community blooming
Of democracy happening

But even though my parents were cool
I had to teach myself to see
All that stuff that got lost
On its way to church
All that stuff that got lost
On its way to school
All that stuff that got lost
On its way to the house of my family
But something was not lost on me

Teach myself to see each of us
Through the limbs of forgiveness
Like we're stuck with each other, god forbid
Teach myself to smile
And stop and talk to whole other color kids
Teach myself to be new in an instant like the truth
Is accessible at any time
Teach myself its never ever one or the other
It's a paradox in every paradigm

And my quarter to buy lunch
And on that big yellow bus

Who would fall into magnet school
And I remember thinking that the long hair lady
Who called herself a poet was particularly cool
Someone stood up and gestured to a forest of options
And I found my path to joy through those trees
But I had to teach myself to keep coming back
To the view from a field from right in the middle of my peace

Ani DiFranco,"Thirty-three years go by
And not once do you come home
To find a man sitting in your bedroom
That is
A man you don't know
Who came a long way to deliver one very specific message:
Lock your back door, you idiot
However invincible you imagine yourself to be
You are wrong

Thirty-three years go by
And you loosen the momentum of teenage nightmares
Your breasts hang like a woman's
And you don't jump at shadows anymore
Instead you may simply pause to admire
Those that move with the grace of trees
Dancing past streetlights
And you walk through your house without turning on lamps
Sure of the angle from door to table
From table to staircase
Sure of the number of steps
Seven to the landing
Two to turn right
Then seven more
Sure you will stroll serenely on the moving walkway of memory
Across your bedroom 
And collapse with a sigh onto your bed
Shoes falling
Thunk thunk
Onto the floor
And there will be no strange man
Suddenly all that time sitting there
Sitting there on what must be the prize chair
In your collection of uncomfortable chairs
With a wild look in his eyes
And hands that you cannot see
Holding what?
You do not know

So sure are you of the endless drumming rhythm of your isolation
That you are painfully slow to adjust
If only because 
Yours is not that genre of story
Still and again, life cannot muster the stuff of movies
No bullets shattering glass
Instead fear sits patiently
Fear almost smiles when you finally see him
Though you have kept him waiting for thirty-three years
And now he has let himself in
And he has brought you fistfuls of teenage nightmares
Though you think you see, in your naivete
That he is empty handed
And this brings you great relief 
At the time

New as you are, really, to the idea that
Even after you've long since gotten used to the parameters
They can all change
While you're out one night having a drink with a friend
Some big hand may be turning a big dial
Switching channels on your dreams
Until you find yourself lost in them
And watching your daily life with the sound off
And of course having cautiously turned down the flame under your eyes
There are more shadows around everything
Your vision a dim flashlight that you have to shake all the way to the outhouse
Your solitude elevating itself like the spirit of the dead
Presiding over your supposed repose
Not really sleep at all 
Just a sleeping position and a series of suspicious sounds
A clanking pipe
A creaking branch 
The footfalls of a cat
All of this and maybe 
The swish of the soft leather of your intruder's coat
As you walk him step by step back to the door
Having talked him down off the ledge of a very bad idea
Soft leather, big feet, almond eyes
The kinds of details the police officer would ask for later
With his clipboard 
And his pistol 
In your hallway",Parameters

But without all the acceptance and getting by
That got my father through

Night falls like people into love
We generate our own light
To compensate
For the lack of light from above

A cold wind blows our way

How to sway and say

And I start slipping away
I was taught to zip it
If I got nothing nice to say

And down in the Texas of my heart
Driving a really big truck
Headed down a dirt road
My love is scrunching up its features
The really big eyes, big lips, big nose

Just show me a moment that is mine
Its beauty blinding and unsurpassed
Make me forget every moment that went by
And left me so half-hearted
'cause I felt it so half-assed

You are an unruly, translucent
A dirty windshield with a shifting view
So many cunning running landscapes
For my dented door to open into

I just wanna tune out all the billboards
Weld myself a mental shield
I just wanna put down all the pressures
And feel how I really feel

Just show me a moment that is mine
Its beauty blinding and unsurpassed
Make me forget every moment that went by
And left me so half-hearted
'cause I felt it so half-assed

Spring is super in the supermarkets
And the strawberries prance and glow
Never mind that they're all kinda tart
And tasteless as strawberries go

Meanwhile, wild things are not for sale
Anymore than they are for show
So I'll be outside
In love with the kind of beauty
It takes more than eyes to know

Just show me a moment that is mine
Its beauty blinding and unsurpassed
And I'll forget every moment that went by
And left me so half-hearted
'cause I felt it so half-assed

Rain falling around me

Traffic was hissing by
And I was homesick and I was high

And I was surrounded by a language
In which I could say only hello
And thank you very much, but you
But you spoke so I could understand
And I drew a treasure map on your hand

And you were no picnic
You were no prize
But you had just enough pathos 
To keep me hypnotized, hypnotized
Hypnotized, hypnotized
Hypnotized

And the map led to an island
In a sea of store-bought dreams
Where soulless singers sang
Over beats built by machines

And lovely girls were hovering
Above my head like gulls with their
Long slender necks and their delicate skulls

And I was no picnic
I was no prize
But I had just enough sweetness to keep you hypnotized

One eye at a time
Your talons like fish hooks

You are a rare bird
The kind I wouldn't even mind
Writing in the margins of my books

Sometimes I see myself
Through the eyes of a stray dog
From an alley across the street
And my whole mission just seems so finite
My whole saga just seems so cheap

I mean I know that now is all there is
And love just makes you cry
So I live for the sight of a rare bird
Suddenly flying by

And I meet your stare
One eye at a time
Writing in the margins of my mind

Sometimes I see myself
Through the eyes of a stray dog
From an alley across the street
And my whole mission just seems so finite
My whole saga just seems so cheap

Ani DiFranco,"Manhattan is an island
Like the women who are
Surrounded by children in a car
Surrounded by cars

Or Manhattan was a project
That projected the worst of mankind
First, one and then the other
Has made its mark on my mind

It's sixty years later
Near the hypo-center of the A-bomb
I'm in the middle of Hiroshima
Watching a twisted old Eucalyptus tree wave

One of the very few lives
That survived and lives on
Remembering the day it was suddenly
Thousands of degrees in the shade

And what all of nature gave birth to
Terror took in a blinding ray
With the kind of pain
It would take cancer so many years just to say

Oh, to grow up gagged and blindfolded
A man's world in your little girl's head
The voice of the great Mother drowned out
In the constant honking
Haunting the car crash up ahead

Oh, to grow up hypnotized
And then try to shake yourself awake
'cause you can sense what has been lost
'cause you can sense what is at stake

Yeah, so it took me a few years to catch on
That those days I catch everyone's eye
Correspond with those nights of the month
When the moon gleams like an egg in the sky

And men are using a sense
They don't even know they have
Just to watch me walk by
And me, I'm supposed to be sensible
Leave my animal outside to cry

But when all of nature conspires
To make me her glorious whore
It's 'cause in my body, I hold the secret recipe
Of precisely what life is for

And the patriarchy that looks to shame me for it
Is the same one making war
And I've said too much already
But I'll tell you something more

To split yourself in two
Is just the most radical thing you can do
So girl, if that shit ain't up to you
Then you simply are not free

'cause from the sunlight on my hair
To which eggs I grow to term
To the expression that I wear
All I really own is me

Yes, to split yourself in two
Is just the most radical thing you can do
Goddess forbid, that little atom
Should grow so jealous of Eve

And in the face of the great farce
Of the nuclear age
Feminism ain't about equality
It's about reprieve

Ani DiFranco,"I had to leave the house of fashion
Go forth naked from its doors
'cause women should be allies
Not competitors

And I had to leave the house of God
'cause Cross replaced the wheel
And the goddesses were out in the garden
With the plants that nourish and heal

I had to leave the house of privilege
Spend Christmas homeless and feeling bad
To learn that privilege is a headache
That you don't know, that you don't have

And I had to leave the house of television
To start noticing the clouds
It's amazing the stuff you see
When you finally shed that shroud

I had to leave the house of conformity
In order to make art
I had to be more or less true
To learn to tell the two apart

And I had to leave the house of fear
Just about as soon as I could crawl
Ignore my face on the 'Wanted' posters
Stuck to the post office wall

I had to leave the house of self-importance
To doodle my first tattoo
Realize a tattoo is no more permanent
Than I am

And who ever said that life is suffering
I think they had their finger on the pulse of joy
Ain't the power of transcendence
The greatest one we can employ?

That lies behind the question

Out there trying to make harmony

Looking right past the obvious
And I know what is so big and so close

Played like the song

Since you held me to your chest
And told me that you love me
More than all the rest?

It's such a shame that you won't talk to me

I believe that there is more to life
We could've loved each other through
But I was afraid of commitment
When it came to you

I'll tell you, if there is one instinct
I just can't get with at all
It's the urge to kill something beautiful
Just to hang it on your wall

Ani DiFranco,"I will not stand immersed in this ultraviolet curse
I won't let you make a tool of me, I will keep my mind and body free

Bye Bye minutiae
Of the day to day drama
I am expanding exponentially
I am consciousness without identity
I am many things made of everything
but I will not be your bankroll
I won't idle in your drive thru, I won't watch your electric sideshow
I got way better places to to go

I will maintain the truth I knew naturally as a child
I won't forfeit my creativity to a world that's all laid our for me
I will look at everything and I will vow to bear in mind
That all of this was just someone's idea, it could just as well be mine

I won't rent you my time, I won't sell you my brain
I won't pray to a male god, cause you know, that would be insane
I can't support the troops, cause every last one of them is being duped
I will not rest a wink, until we women have regrouped

I am many things made of everything

I won't go in your drive thru, I won't watch your electric sideshow

Ani DiFranco,"The glory of the atom
Begs a reverent word
The primary design
Of the whole universe
Yes, let us sing its praises
Let us bow our heads in prayer
At the magnificent consciousness
Incarnate there

The smallest unit of matter
With its orbiting electrons
Echoing off the solar system
Like a hawk in the hills at dawn
The smallest unit of matter
Uniting bird and rock and tree
And you and me

Oh holy is the atom

To which all of evolution
Is graciously aligned
One single structure
To which everything distills

To everything that's real
Far outside the boundaries
Of the digitized ordeal
Leave me here awake
Leave me here to heal

Between monkeys and ants
You can see us from your spaceship
Melting the polar ice caps
With our arrogance
Summon a congress of angels
Dressed in riot gear
We've got ourselves a serious situation
Down here

I have this great great uncle
Who worked on the atomic bomb
He got a nobel prize in physics
And a place in song
And I bet there were no windows
And no women in the room
When they applied themselves
To the pure science of

Yes, messing with the atom
Is the highest form of blasphemy
Whether you are making weapons
Or simple electricity
Someone fashion me a pulpit
I have been called to engage
With the maniacal heretics
Of the nuclear age!

Let the religious get religion
Let consumers get a clue
Let scientists get perspective
Let activists get their due
Let industry get a conscience
Let the earth inherit the meek
Let the divinity of nature speak

Ani DiFranco,"Emancipated minor
Well directed, brilliantly casted
Riding a Greyhound down to the city
With her fake I.D. and a hell of a little hand basket

Little game of seesaw, then he came to claim her
And then a sordid line formed behind him
Reproductive system newly activated
She participated in nature's plan, she participated

And I can't say I envy her, I don't think I miss it
Wrought iron cobwebbing over thin windowpanes
The city seducing you on tiptoe to kiss it
Don't think twice, just roll the dice, roll the dice

So she attended the dance classes and she learned the little dance
And she tried the high heels but she couldn't bring herself to prance
All the while a faint ticking in the silence between the songs
Just south of her gut two tiny time bombs

And love comes in many forms and for each she would yearn
Hungry as a student, hunger to learn
Every flavor of person, every species of intent
With the body pulsing at the center detente

But all the good graffiti got painted over in time
She watched the last faceless chain replace the last five and dime
And she wondered if the only noble thing
Ain't to just to get a big garden and plant it in the spring

Kiss the city goodbye in some big graceful gesture
And focus on the moon's groove, groove with the moon
Focus on the moon's groove and groove with the moon
Focus on the moon's groove, groove with the moon

And I can't say I envy her, I don't think I miss it

Ani DiFranco,"A throat with a heart in it stuck in traffic
A ticket and a mind to fly, an alarm clock still drunk and high
Sanity painted her mask on all the way across town
A compact frown projected on a retina upside down

You're an avalanche of detour signs falling off a truck
Swooning like a boxer that is too dizzy to duck
Your decisions turn around and make you back and then you're stuck
And then good luck, good luck, good luck, good luck

A lock with a key in it that ain't turning
Smoke filling up behind a door, a fire with the purpose of being ignored
A body slipping into disease, quietly making that choice
While the joy drains out of a voice

You're an avalanche of detour signs falling off a truck
Swooning like a boxer that is too dizzy to duck

Summon up the courage to put down your landing gear
And come out here,
Cause I am as exhausted as a drowning polar bear
Swimming around looking for a ride
And its so god awful hot outside.

Quit kicking me in the rib every time Adam tells what he did.
""Man creates woman"" he says,
Sweeping his hand though the air like Mr.Show Biz.

Your gonna love this world
If its the last thing that I do,
The whole extravagant joke
Topped in bitter sweet chocolate goo.
For someone who ain't even here yet,
Look how much the world loves you,
Look how much the world loves you.

The candles are burning down,
The music is fading,
Your pinata is torn.
Its time to be born,
And death is at the door peddling its old fashioned blood and gore
Here at the house of creation.
Cutest sobering moment of revelation.

Ani DiFranco,"So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here

Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
And how we found
The same old fears
Wish you were here",Present/Infant
Ani DiFranco,"New years eve we dropped mushrooms
And danced around the house
Making music with everything that we found
Incantation replaced resolution
And we vowed to allow each perfection
That we could be
And the goddess sent word
That this would be a red letter year
They didn't mention how much shit was gonna change around here

It's just as well we weren't swollen with unfocused dread
We had visions of sugarplums dancing in our heads
Dancing in our heads

First you go under and then you coming up gives you bends
And when you break the surface
And all you see is your friends
So you grab your purple crayon
And flush out the picture behind
And finally the whole world is made of one unbroken line
One unbroken line

And when you wake up sick as a dog
With dull eyes and really bad hair
Standing under a lit sign with the words on air
And the water is rising
It's coming in everywhere
Just remember you are there
You're always, always there.

And representing the white race
A man with a monkey for a face
Is flying over in his helicopter
Whistling dixie and playing dumb

In a town that might put a gun to your throat
Or rip the roof right off your place
There's a mold crawling up the walls
And falling asleep in your lungs
And you and I both know how to drink some
We will always have work in this town
Besides the police are stationed at the bridge
And they're preventing passage to higher ground

And get ourselves a ringside seat

Standing over the kitchen counter
With only the sound of chewing in the room
I can see you as a challenge,

Cool and refreshing, running down your arm,

Put it down in the books for good

Of women
Make diversity legal
Make it finally understood

Don’t have an abortion
And teach your children
How they can avoid them
But don’t treat all women
Like they are your children

Can choose to refrain

True dominion

Or at any cause to preserve you

Life is also profane

To their breast
Trust, women will always
Do their best
Trust, our differences make us stronger
Not less

In this amendment shall be
Family structure shall be free
We’ll have the right to civil our unions
With equal rights and
Equal protection
Intolerance finally
Ruined

And then there’s the kids rights
They’ll naturally be on board
The funnel through which
Women’s lives are poured
Our family is so big
And we’re all so very small
Let a web of relationship
Be laid over it all

Over the strutter of power piled up to the sky
Over the illusion of autonomy on which it relies
Over any absolute that nature does not supply

And the birthing woman shall regain her place
In a circle of women, in a sacred space
Turn off the machines, put away the knifes
This amendment shall deliver from bondage midwives",Amendment

Halfway down the street oh

And I remember that old hotel had quite the smell
Where I would go to use the phone
Between the donut shop and the pizza parlor
Where I learned to live alone
Sweet sixteen and smiling
My way out of any jam
Learning the ways of the world, oh my
Learning the ways of man oh

And I didn't really want a baby
And I guess that I had a choice
But I just let it grow inside me
This persistent little voice
And I guess I got her off and running
And then run off is what she did
And that's part of what I think about
Think about that kid oh

So now there's nothing left to wish upon
Except for passing cars
The cacophony of city lights
Is drowning out the stars
This park bench is a life boat
And the rest a big dark sea
And I'm just gonna lie here until
Something comes and finds me oh

Yeah I got this tired old face
Still grinning most of the time
Just 'cause it don't have a better way
To express what's on it's mind
And I got this running monologue
Entertaining in it's outrage
And I've got the air of an animal
That's been living in a cage oh

Every time I open my mouth
I take off my clothes
I'm raw and frostbitten from
Being exposed
I got red scabby hands
And purple scabby feet
And you can smell me coming from
Halfway down the street",Life Boat

From the Painted Desert
Over to Paris, France
I followed your pointed
Finger with my glance

And I’ve seen so much
More than I would see
If it was just me, just me
If it was just me, just me

Our first rehearsal
Was under a redwood tree
And you brought lyrics and you
Handed them to me

And you said here you are
The only one who can sing this

If it was just me, just me

Ani DiFranco,"Promiscuity is nothing more than traveling
There's more than one way to see the world
And some of us like to stick close to home
And some of us are Columbus
What can I say?

Nature always gets her way
Nature always gets her way

And seeing the world through another's eyes
Is like busting a window in a house of lies
And in the end you make up your own mind

And there's wide open spaces
And little cornered off places
And check 'em out
Check 'em out
Take your time

How far is too far?
How much is enough?
You gotta test this stuff

What you like

A few times on that bike

I mean how you gonna know
Who you are
What you feel
Till you feel a few things
That just don't feel real

And promiscuity is research and development
Evolution begs embellishment
And baby you're a star

And you got two invisible eyes on society
And when society gets cruel
Make like you're nature's tool
Which you are

And nature always gets her way
Nature always gets her way

And monogamy is that carnival trophy you earn
When you throw that ball into that urn
It's somewhat dumb luck, somewhat learned

And honestly i myself just started
And eureka I'm less broken hearted

Like we can’t even bring ourselves to sweat

Just enough to know that we’re alive
Watch out for that TV, it’s full of splinters

Women who bleed and bleed and bleed
Women who swim with the tide, women who change when the wind blows
Show us we are connected to everything
Show us we are not separate from everything

I will teach you to unhide
In the city where they don't need x-rays

When I go to do my food shopping
And all I can see is the packaging
One big mountain of garbage
About to be happening

I feel so broken

It's about love, it's about hate when you lose your faith
It's about truth, it's about lies that you just can't hide
It's about joy, it's about pain; is there something to gain?
It's about black, it's about white

I guess I'm gonna head out west
Trade my old collection of records and things
Get a new car, get a new guy
Get a new lease on life

 Yakko: In Germany it's ""guten Tag"" 
 Which also means ""good day"" 
 ""Ni hao"" is exactly how 
 Hello sounds in Taipei. 
 In Portugal it's ""ola"" 
 In Arabic, ""salem"" 
 Saying ""zravo"" means hello 
 In Macedonian. 
 It's ""aloha"" in Hawaii 
 They say ""ya su"" in Greece 
 In Israel the word's ""shalom"" 
 And that means ""peace"". 
 The Italians have ""buon giorno"" 
 The Viennese, ""servus"" 
 When you're at the Eiffel Tower 
 Just smile and say ""salut!""

 Hello is just plain ""yo!""

Animaniacs,"Got a trap-steamer, my ship's called Hal
Forty miles on the Panama Canal
Got a cargo of sodas, they are lo-cal
Forty miles on the Panama Canal

Sailing 'cross the Caribbean Sea
Do the Pacific in a jiffy
Peru, Panama but not on land
I'd look silly with my ship in the sand

Yo Hal, try that canal
Yo Hal, the canal is your pal
You can sail a cargo ship
From sea to shining sea

Through the Panama Canal
for a nominal fee
You enter a lock, it's a ship coral
Forty miles on the Panama Canal

You pay your money, then get a decal
Forty miles on the Panama Canal
You cross the locks, they number three
Full of water for you and me

100 feet wide, 41 feet deep
Water enough to drench a sheep
High lock, up goes the ship
Low lock, the ship takes a dip

First they raise the water level
Then lower it again
'Cross the Panama Canal
It's real easy

We pass the locks, with good moral
Forty miles on the Panama Canal
The crew yells out, 'Thank you, Hal'
Forty Miles on the Panama Canal

You're welcome, men
Wasn't that fun
Forty miles, our voyage is done
For I'm full on now past Balboa

Adios Panama, so long - aloha",The Panama Canal
Animaniacs,"It's a quiet, peaceful night, the moon is shining bright
Giving not a hint of what's in store
A few hours before morning without a single warning
Something strange begins to move the floor

A quake, a quake
The house begins to shake
You're bouncing 'cross the floor
And watching all your dishes break

You're sleeping, there's a quake
You're instantly awake
You're leaping out of bed
And shouting, ""Oh, for heaven's sake""

I ran outside with neighbors
Their faces full of shocks
That's because I'm standing there
In nothing but my socks

Oops, a quake, a quake
This must be a mistake
Just feel the ground go up and down
Won't someone hit the brake?

A quake, a quake
Oh, what a mess they make
The bricks, the walls, the chimney falls
Destruction in its wake

I did not have insurance
I called them from the scene
And suddenly I'm listening
To an answering machine

Say, ""Too late, too late
You shouldn't ought to wait
'Cause now you're stuck, we wish you luck
Here comes a six point eight""

Whose fault, whose fault?
Blame it on the fault
'Cause Mister Richter can't predict her
Kicking our asphalt

Seismologists all say
Tectonic plates are in between
An encroaching crustal mantle
Yeah, so what the heck's that mean?

It means a quake, a quake
Oh really, yeah, no fake
We kind of had that feeling
When the ground began to shake

And so we wait
Resign ourselves to fate
Because our lawn
Is sitting on a continental plate

We shivered through a blizzard
Went swimming in a flood
Then we blew off a hurricane
And now we hear a thud

Of a quake, a quake
How much more can we take?
We thought that we had seen it all
But this one takes the cake

The dirt, the rocks
Those crazy aftershocks
It's just the planet moving granite
Several city blocks

Now the town is falling down
While the ground moves around
We won't let it get us down
Get beneath the door frame

A quake, a quake
It's time to pull up stake
The worst is over, we don't buy it
We're fed up, we can't deny it
We just want some peace and quiet
So we're moving to Beirut",A Quake! A Quake!

Animaniacs,"Miss flameil:Yakko,
Yakko:yea miss Flameil?
Miss Flameil:I want you to multiply...47 times...83


7 times 3 is 21 which as you know is just two 10's plus 1 
And so we put the one right here and we carry the 2 one left
To the top of the tenths place right next door
And we put it on top of the number 4
Which is really four tenths that we multiply times 3 in the ones place
And that's why
We now have 12 which we add to the 2 that we carry to get 14

See how easy that was
Ho ho it's multiplication
Yes math education
Hey Albert Einstein said that it's so easy to do
It's simple it's breezy
It's fun and it's easy
So buy a calculator
You can multiply too

And now the second digit!
7 times 8 is 56 which as you know is just 5 tens plus 6
And so we put the 6 in the tenths place, left of the one
Carry the 5 like we did before
To the top of the tenths place next to the 4
Then multiply that 4 times 8 to get 32 see isn't this great
Then we add the 5 that we carried before to get 37
Then add once more, straight down to get 3901

Isn't this swell
Oh lets give multiplication
A standing innovation
Issac Newton multiplied a couple times two
Times, two, times two
It's simple it's breezy
It's fun and it's easy
Just buy a calculator, and study this stuff later
Maybe someday you can multiply numbers, 2..3..4..5..recess!",Multiplication

I will have you
Yes, I will have you
I will find a way and I will have you
Like a butterfly
A wild butterly
I will collect you and capture you

You are an obsession
You're my obsession
Who do you want me to be
To make you sleep with me
You are an obsession
You're my obsession
Who do you want me to be
To make you sleep with me",Obsession [12 Inch Remix Version]
Animotion,"I lay here beside you, just thinkin' all night
I believe that tomorrow would make things all right
I still tell you I love you, that you're forever mine
It makes you feel good and it buys me some time

[Chorus:]
If I told you I needed you
But I sent you away
I've been calling it love
Because I want you to stay
Calling it love
Say you'll stay
Calling it love
'Cause I'm too scared to say
Let's call it a day

I never questioned my feelings before
I felt but I felt there was it, nothin' more
But I can't keep denying the truth in my heart
Ooo, the touching and talking but we're oceans apart

[Chorus]

I've been spending my life
Thinking you're the one
Now I'm holding my lies
And the damage was done

If I told you I needed you
But I sent you away
I've been calling it love
Because I want you to stay
Calling it love
Say you'll stay
Calling it love
'Cause I'm too scared to say

I've been calling it love
I've been calling it love
Because I want you to stay
Calling it love
Say you'll stay

Calling it love
'Cause I'm too scared to say
I've been calling it love...
I've been calling it love...",Calling It Love
Animotion,"I know it seems like I'm a million miles away
At times you feel like you don't even know me
But in this world the pressure's building everyday
And I need time to work things out - oh baby

It's not that I don't love you - oh no
It's just that I - I've got to have

Room to move - that's all I need
That's all I ask for - room to breathe
Room to move - that's all I need
That's all I ask for - give it to me
Room to move - everybody needs - room to move

Everybody needs some freedom to survive
To shake the chains of responsability
And you can help me make this feeling come alive
'Cause when you hold me close - that's when you set me free

Girl you know I'll always love you - oh yeah
'Cause when we touch - I get so much

You lose your mind - if you don't take time
You cross that line and your mind explodes
You push too hard - and your feelings starve
Emotions are - all destroyed
Girl you know I'll always love you - oh yeah
'Cause when we touch - I get so much",Room to Move

C'est un peu étrange savoir qu'on s'verra plus
Même si on s'croisait que de temps en temps
J't'appréciais sincèrement
Alors aux cuites qu'on s'prenait consciencieusement
À ton talent
À la toile que tu t'payes vu de là-haut maintenant
Une gorgée pour la mort qui nous chope au tournant
Il y a des moments qui balaient toute la merde de la vie
Des plaisirs simples qui nous apaisent de certains soucis
Des tracasseries du temps qui passent et nous vieillit
Polit nos crânes et parfois même nous assagit
Nous épanouit ou nous aigrit
Un peu trop cette fois-ci
On a des sentiments
Si étranges et si souvent des sentiments
De boum bye bye à la prochaine j'descends
Des sentiments
Pacifiques ou violents
Des sentiments
Bien étranges de temps en temps
Mais tant qu'on les a et les ressent
Ils nous maintiennent bien vivants
J'espère qu't'es mieux
Maintenant qu't'es high beubeu
T'étais un peu chelou
Un peu chéper surtout
Qu'est-ce qu'a pu te faire croire que ça valait plus le coup
L'avant veille on était fonfon
Ce jour-là on s'est croisé
J'étais speed j'allais taffer
Alors de loin je t'ai salué
J'crois bien qu'tu tapais un café
Mais je ne me serais douter
Qu'tu checkerais beetlejuice après
C'est Anthony qui me l'a annoncé :
""Sad news from the stars"", comme il disait
""Sad news from the stars""?

La vie est un bien perdu
Quand on ne l'a pas vécu comme on l'aurait voulu
La vie est un bien perdu
Quand on ne l'a pas vécu comme on l'aurait voulu
On vit pour qui et pourquoi je m'demande ça parfois
Quand j'vois la lassitude peinte sur les faces autour de moi
On taffe pour qui déjà quand avant le quinze du mois
Y'a plus d'tune sur le compte en banque
Et qu'on n'sait pas si on finira sous un pont ou sous un toit
À l'hôtel ou dans une bouche de métro
Sous l'regard indifférent des pelos
À rester là juste parce qu'il fait chaud
De nos jours, par les temps qui courent de loin
J'préfère être aveugle que sourd
Je crois même qu'l'amour ne sauve pas d'la précarité
La vie reste belle mais le monde est sans pitié
La réalité nous brûle nous montre ses crocs acérés, laissant
Les plus largués sur le bas-côté
Refrain
Et la vie est un bien perdu
Quand on ne l'a pas vécu comme on l'aurait voulu
La vie est un bien perdu
Quand on ne l'a pas vécu comme on l'aurait voulu
Incompréhension, quiproquos,
On s'bat pour la même chose à différents niveaux
On perd sa vie à tenter de la gagner
Ou on perd la raison et on finit interné
Je vois le visage marqué des gens trop anxieux
Et la porte de la solitude derrière leurs yeux
Je n'prie pas pour eux, ai des doutes sur Dieu
Leur souhaite seulement que ça aille mieux
Je suis plus qu'hier et moins que demain, c'est clair
J'préfère me taire juste pour ne pas parler
Laisser s'installer le silence
Les jours passent comme les nuages et j'ignore presque tout
Sauf que les oiseaux là-haut rient de nous

La vie est un bien perdu
Quand on ne l'a pas vécu comme on l'aurait voulu

Qu'un jour les choses vont changer
Putain j'y crois m'y accroche pour en avoir un bout
Et en connaître le goût avant que le grand Cric ne m'croque
Et n'm'extirpe d'mon trou eh eh l'ami
J'veux qu'on s'amuse comme des fous
Quand c'est qu'on m'jettera dans l'trou
Non mais sérieux, ça s'rait mieux

J'ai des idées étranges et des rêves un peu fous
J'aimerais causer avec les animaux comme je le fais avec vous
Faire de la gratte comme Django, Jimmy et Paco
Pour ça j'me lève tôt le matin,
J'fais des arpèges avant le p'tit déj', paraît qu'on a rien sans rien
Si le savoir est un privilège
J'en sais trop rien
Je donne ma langue au chat cousin
Bien que je sois chelou
Un peu vilain pas voyou
Même pas méchant pour deux sous
Tout juste innocent comme vous
Même si comme vous,
Parfois j'ai un peu de mal à aller jusqu'au bout
J'avoue, Johnny, plus d'une fois, j'avoue, j'ai pris mes jambes à mon coup

Au pire je saurais m'éclipser.

Un double sky sans glace et une gainedouze pour l'écraser
J'tète le goulot après le cul sec et ça m'allège les pensées?

Les amours la famille nos égos et nos petits périmètres de gloire
Les tentatives les échecs les victoires et les complexes face au miroir

Qui s'échouent sur tes dessous parfumés
Tâches de douceur, graines de beauté
Voici d'authentiques hypothétiques baisers
Au plaisir de t'attraper
Bien à toi sans prétention et quelques arrières-pensées
J'ai perdu la raison quand tu m'as aveuglé
Tu es la fille du soleil et je vais me brûler
Tu es ce poème que j'aime déshabiller

Dance hall queen, danseuse étoile
La belle Javanaise et ses yeux couleur de braise

Elle donne des couleurs au silence

Il ne faut pas la saouler
Elle est chorégraphe de ses pas

L'automne aussi
L'été, c'est bien? bien
Le printemps, je préfère
Il peut bien pleuvoir ce matin
Ça changera rien
Tout ira bien

En revenant de Rio,
J'ai paumé tout le sun qu'il y avait sur ma peau de gringo
Comme dit Jidé, c'était peut-être un voyage de trop
Et là-bas, j'ai pas perdu qu'des kilos,
Des kilos? des kilos? des kilos?
Des kil' de trop, des kil' de trop?

(Oxmo) 
Je te veux amusante, respire les vapeurs aromatisantes
Le sourire, y'en a jamais trop dans ma tisane
Et depuis que le printemps et l'hiver se sont remariés à Paris
Je reste à l'abri pour chanter avec Anis
À cheval sur la guitare, c'est le trio de Janeiro
C'est nous les gentils, mais tu connais déjà les rôles, 
Lâche ton numéro que je l'oublie
À cause de l'avalanche de boulot
Je nage en roue libre
Éternel poémien
Écoute un peu beau que tout aille bien
Rien de bien sans témoin, pas de vie sans pépin
C'est un blues joyeux, Mesdames & Messieurs,
Signé, swingué
Ça swing?

Anita Ammersfeld,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.","Speak Low, song for voice & piano (from ""One Touch of Venus"")"

If I could I'd give you the world
Wrap it all around you
Won't be satisfied with just a piece of this heart

My angel, oh, angel
You're my angel, oh, angel

Dreams are dreams, some dreams come true
I found a real dream, baby, when I found you
You're so strong, but tender too

You're my angel, oh, angel
You're my angel, oh, angel

Love like ours is Heaven-sent
Each day a day to remember
I feel so safe, feel secure with you

You give me love, you keep right on giving
Fill me up, baby, with the joy of living
When things get tough, I can always turn to you

You're my angel, oh, angel
You're my angel

Love the way we touch, I love the way it feels
Every time you're near me, my poor heart just won't keep still
No doubt about that this love I feel is real
Ask me to go with you, you know I will

Hold me near, hold me tight
Only you can make it real, only you make it all right

Do you believe me?
And when I try to give my love to you
Do you receive me?
When I try to do my best and you put me to the test
Baby, do you deceive me?
So baby do what you gotta do and when you do
You're gonna need me

Don't confuse your mind with what the other people say
You will see in time, baby that my love is here to stay
They gonna try to come between us baby
We can't let them in our way
We have got a good thang going
Don't you let it slip away
Don't you let it slip away

Believe in me

Now I can deal with the problems that the world has put on me
But sometimes it just gets to hard and I just feel so weak

Anita Baker,"[Chorus:]
You've got to feel the need in me
[Repeat x 4]

Alone I feel at times wondering if you're truly mine
Can't you see the tears falling from my eyes
Can't you feel the pain I feel deep inside
My heart seems to bleed when I feel the need
To hold you in my arms and you pull away
Now I may be wrong but my feelings just don't lie
About this emptiness down deep inside, that's why

[Chorus x 3]

When you're around you make me feel so good
All of my worries are far away
Then other times you feel so cold
What makes you treat me this way

[Chorus x 4]

Everybody say that I got to be a fool
I got to be crazy for lovin' you
And I'm starting to wonder if there is truth in what they say
My mind says to leave you, but my heart says I better stay
I want to feel like I'm something more than a passing though from you
I need to know that the things you say are true
I want that sweet, sweet love to fill me up inside
And let our two hearts come together for all times

I do not say things that I don't mean
If I do not love you I'd let you know
If I am not right for you
Won't you tell me so
Before you break my heart in two

[Chorus x 5]",Feel the Need
Anita Baker,"Everybody wants to be a winner
And take their place at the top
Everyone wants their name up in lights,

You feel misused
You've got to leave those troubles behind

Sometimes you win,
Sometimes you lose
Sometimes you want to cry,
Sometimes you play the fool

Hold on a little longer
Try to be a little stronger
And you can win

But the time will come when the tables turn
And you're gonna have the winning hand

Come on and squeeze me
Baby won't you tease me
Come on and squeeze me
I like it when you tease me

Like the way you shake your thang
Like the way you move
Love the way you so casually slide into the groove

You know you take me so high boy
I don't want to come down
You don't have to come down
You don't have to be shy, baby
As long as I'm around

Ooh you love me so good
I could never love another
And I wish you would
Not be so undercover

[Chorus x 2]

Whenever I get lonely I start thinking about you
Ooh sweet baby you're the only one can do the things you do
You tickle my fascination
I get all caught up around you
Such a thrilling sensation
When you get into my groove

Hold me
Tell me I'm your one and only baby
Ooh make it good tonight
I'm gonna make it feel so nice
Ooh your love is so good
I can never love another

Anita Baker,"Something has come over me
A feeling I can't explain
The love I lost I found again
My broken heart you came to mend
But it still seems as though we are miles and miles apart

The very best is all I got
It's all I got to give
My soul was lost in darkness
But you arrived to see me through
And you came to me all by surprise
Then I moved the dark ness right out of my eyes
And it's plain to see
That you were all I need
And I want to know

[Chorus:]
Will you be mine?
Sugar will you be mine
Sugar will you be mine
Sugar will you be mine

This kind of love only comes around
Only once in a lifetime
But the last love I tried to hold
It left me feelin' so empty and blue
And it made me afraid to let my true feelings show

I need you here right by my side
Each and every night
My soul is cryin' out to you
It's reaching out for somethin' true 
Do I have to go
To get you into my life
The suspense is tearing me, tearing me apart

Won't you bring your love
Bring it all to me
So we can live together eternally
Will you be mine?

Anita Baker,"You're the best thing yet, to ever come into my life

An understanding hand, when the world calls me grand
You protected my heart, right from the start
Sensitive vibes are strong and true
The very best I've always shared with you

And if I should fall or if I'm standing tall
I can see you standing there, always willing to share
Each and every part of me
You see things I never, never see

And you're the best thing yet, to ever come into my life
And you're the best thing yet, to ever come into my life

Deep down in my mind, mind
I wonder at the blessing that I could find
Someone as loving as you
Could bring into my life this feeling so right and so true

Like the flowing waters of a silver stream
And like the misty vision in a midnight dream
Such a wonder of life to me
So rare is found such a reason to be

You're the best thing yet, to ever come into my life
And you're the best thing yet, to ever come into my life

Like the flowing waters of a silver stream
And like the misty vision in a midnight dream

So rare is found such a reason to be, yeah

But this desire never seems to go away
It's gonna take much more than hope to bring you close

And there is so much more this heart of mine can take
If what you have to bring to me is positive you send it right away

This must be, sweet fatal attraction

Love this strong, it just brings out the passion
I never knew was here in me

I love you just because

I'm so glad I took the path that led to this
And it's amazin' loving you, I'm doin' things
I never thought I'd do

I don't know, there ain't no explanation
Of why I'm sharin' love at last this way
I won't try to work out all my reasons
I'll use these words to simply say

Maybe that's the reason why

And now this heartbeat wants control oooh baby
If the love was meant to be so strong

Without your touch, I cannot see
Lead me into love 

I'm deep in the miracle of you oooh",Lead Me Into Love
Anita Baker,"Love was meant to be loving
So many times we don't give, we take
Love has really no conception to this rule
Days you gave me were numbered
And as a rule they were hard to take
All it took was the number of a fool
Rules were made to be broken
So many hearts break the same way too, aw baby
I said that you ain't no exception to the rule, yes sir
Your answer begging my question
It seems I left you too late to ask
Was this really your intention
From the start
The nights you left me are empty, baby
As for the answer, they changed the past
I tried to let you explain your change of heart
How could you change your mind
Rules were made to be broken 
So many hearts break the same way too, aw honey
I said that you ain't no exception to the rule
How could they say
It would be better this way?without you
When by the usual rules
I kept presuming that you would stay, baby
So many hearts break the same way too, no mister
I said that you ain't no exception to the rule
You?
Gonna get on my bad heart
Just like everybody asks you
You've gotta help baby
You've gotta help me convert, too
You better hear what I'm telling you",Rules
Anita Baker,"I can remember stories, those things my mother said
She told me fairy tales, before I went to bed
She spoke of happy endings, then tucked me in real tight
She turned my night light on, and kissed my face good night
My mind would fill with visions, of perfect paradise
She told me everything, she said he'd be so nice
He'd ride up on his horse and, take me away one night
I'd be so happy with him, we'd ride clean out of sight

She never said that we would, curse, cry and scream and lie
She never said that maybe, someday he'd say goodbye

The story ends, as stories do
Reality steps into view
No longer living life in paradise-or fairy tales-uh
No, uh-huh-mmm-mmm

She spoke about happy endings, of stories not like this
She said he'd slay all dragons, defeat the evil prince
She said he'd come to save me, swim through the stormy seas
I'd understand the story, it would be good for me

You never came to save me, you let me stand alone
Out in the wilderness, alone in the cold
My story ends, as stories do
Reality steps into view
No longer living life in paradise-or fairy tales-yes

I don't look for pie up in the sky, baby
Need reality, now, said I
Don't feel the need to be pacified,
Don't cha try
Honey, I know you lied

You never came to save me, you let me stand alone
Out in the wilderness, alone in the cold
I found no magic potion, no horse with wings to fly
I found the poison apply, my destiny to die

No royal kiss could save me, no magic spell to spin
My fantasy is over, my life must now begin

My story ends, as stories do

No longer living life in paradise or fairy tales

Chorus

Come on baby
Make it all right
My baby
Say it's alright
Would you baby
It will be alright
If I could only see you
Won't you please do this for me

Heart of mine please just let him go
Always knew you'd leave and many times I told you so
Yesterday it was when you walked out my door
Hopes and dreams of mine lay scattered on my floor

Chorus

holding on to your memory is what Iv'e done
Baby see what Iv'e done, Baby see what Iv'e done
Oh yeah holding on to my pillow is all Iv'e got
Yeah
And the power of your thunder
Belongs to someone new
Is it any wonder I cry the whole night through
How we ever made it is a mystery to me
Fire and water were never meant to be

Anita Baker,"Hm

What have you done to me
I can't eat, I cannot sleep
And I'm not the same anymore, no, no
I don't know what to do
?Cause all of me wants all of you
Do I stand alone at the shore

Now once I could turn away
From everything I feel today
But now I wanna walk through your door

But I've got to know, oh, body and soul
That you've got no doubt, inside and out
We are whole, ho, body and soul
Don't leave me out in the cold
Just love me body and soul

Do you hear me, baby

I've wasted too much time
Livin' for what wasn't mine
And then came the day I found you
And now I want nothing less
I've found a love that Is truly blessed
And I wanna make dreams come true

But I've got to know, oh, body and soul
That you've got no doubt, inside and out

Anita Baker,"I had a dream
A love dream so tender,
You were with me old friend
We cave in to sweet surrender
And I've held it in through October,
November
No wonder?
It's never been the same since then
I picked up my phone
A million times to call you
But I lost my nerve
'cause everytime I saw ya
like a lovesick kid
it was my paranoia
You'd laugh?.but instead
I read the thoughts inside my head
(Chorus)
It's you
It's been you all the time
Like somebody turnded on a light
It took just a minute
But now that I'm in it
It's you
It's been you all the time
You're changing my whole state of mind,
Watch me shine
It's been you all the time.
Now when you smile
The world opens up for me
You're just my style
And inside I do believe
We're two of a kind
How could I be so blind
My heart?it's sincere
I believe I've wanted you for years and years
(Chorus)
Now to think you've always been right here
And loneliness had been my greatest fear
Until I saw the answers in your eyes,
Yes I did.
And, at last it's clear
Now I see that you're the only one for me.",It's Been You

Is in your eyes
A look your smile can't

Is saying so much more than
Just words could every say

Well it takes my breath away

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

Anita Baker,"My funny valentine. Sweet comic valentine,
You make me smile with my heart.
Your looks are laughable.
Unphotographable,
Yet, you're my favorite work of art.
Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it is speak, are you baby are you smart?
Don't change your hair for me,
Not if you care for me.
Stay little valentine. Stay.
Each day is Valentine's Day.

Baby, don't change your hair for me.
Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak, are
You? Baby are you smart?
Don't change your hair for me.

Every night is?
Every day ooh, ooh.",My Funny Valentine
Anita Baker,"For a little while we know what heartache is
And we feel the pain the world can sometimes bring
For a little while we cry in the night without a single song to sing
But one day all will change, there will be no more stormy rain
Then at last we will rest forever more

So if you're in the valley
(If you're in the valley now)
And life is so unkind
(Life is so unkind)
And if your tears keep falling
(If your tears keep falling)
From your tired eyes
(From your eyes)

Your burden seem so heavy
(Your burden seem so heavy now)
And its hard to smile
(So hard to smile)
You must remember
(You better remember)
It's only for a while

For a little while, well, you lose someone you love
And you miss the time together that you shared
For a little while you feel all alone and scared
With no one there to hold, oh, the nights get long and cold
But it won't last, it will pass in time

So if you're in the valley
(If you're in the valley now)
And life is so unkind
(Life is so unkind)
And if your tears keep falling
(If your tears keep falling)
From your tired eyes
(From your eyes)

Your burden seem so heavy

And it's hard to smile so hard to smile

You better remember, gotta remember
It's only for a while
Oh, yes remember

Anita Baker,"[Dialogue:]
You know, this old world just,
Keeps on spinning around and around and around
And sometimes it just spins too fast
And you, you not only lose your balance
But you lose your rhythm and 
It's at times like these that you just need to stop
And not only find your way again but find your own rhythm
Because life has a rhythm?
And mother nature has a rhythm
And love? Oh yes, love has a rhythm
[Song starts:]
Can't cha come away, away tonight and talk to me
Far away from all the world's insanity.
Fill your heart with music tonight.
Satisfy your soul and ease your mind.
Open your arms, close your eyes
Hearts will harmonize
Making music in your arms
Never before, never anymore
Will you be alone
Now that you have known
My rhythm of love, baby
Rhythm of love
Rhythm of love
Rhythm love darling
Rhythm of love
Hold me closer
Times are troubled, there's no doubt
Where's the cure in times like these?

Open your arms?.

We have all we need, as long as
We believe

I go on loving you this way
When I'm not sure that you are sure
That you will stay

Sometimes I wonder why
I go on hurting like I do
I guess this heart ain't very smart
It wants no one but you

But when I lay in your arms
Child this isn't pretending
This is a real fairy tale
With a happy ending

This tightrope that I walk
A tightrope without a net below
And if I fall, child I just fall

Anyone alone like me, I'm certain they'd agree
'Cause I can't sleep at night

Chorus:
Loneliness is my biggest fear
I wish the feeling would disappear
I can't sleep at night
Coldness is creepin' in
Need to feel your warmth again
I can't sleep at night no

Holding you so very close
That's what I need the most
And it's your job to go around and
Share your gifts from town to town
I hope I'm not misunderstood
The man that treats me so good
But I can't sleep at night
When I pick up this phone
And I hear your voice telling me
You cannot wait until you're home
I can't describe this feeling inside
I can't sleep at night 'cause

Chorus:
I need you to hold you in my arms
Honey how can I be strong
'Cause I can't sleep at night
I need a love I need your thrills
I'm sick and tired of taking pills
'Cause I can't sleep at night

Ooh holding you so very close
That's what I need the most
And I know it's your job to go around
Share your gifts from town to town
Anyone's who's alone like me
I'm sure they'd agree
'Cause I can't sleep at night
Sick of holding my pillow tight
(lots of ad libs)

I'll always be here

Just because I'm near you

It doesn't mean I won't disappear

Been so long . . . of missin' you, baby

Been so long . . . of missin' you, baby

Of once upon a time

Slowly creepin' on me

And they linger on my mind

I just don't know why

Whenever I get close to you

You want to run and hide

It's been so long . . . of missin' you, baby

It's been so long . . . of missin' you, baby

It's been so long . . . of missin' you, baby


We began lovers' dance

The road was smooth to romance

And we sang love sweet song every day


I believe that love would stay in my heart

Now it's torn all apart

It's gone away, I can't stay, I've got to say

I don't believe that you could do me this way


Now don't you understand

I'm in need of comfort

The comfort of your hand in mine

And what I feel inside

Why don't you come closer

I can't hide


Been so long

Been so long . . . can't hide

Been so long

Been so long . . . it's too long, won't you come on, baby

Been so long . . . won't you come home, see about me

see about me

Anita Baker,"God rest ye merry, gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember, Christ, our Saviour
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

In Bethlehem, in Israel,
This blessed Babe was born
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn
The which His Mother Mary
Did nothing take in scorn
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

From God our Heavenly Father
A blessed Angel came;
And unto certain Shepherds
Brought tidings of the same:
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

""Fear not then,"" said the Angel,
""Let nothing you affright,
This day is born a Saviour
Of a pure Virgin bright,
To free all those who trust in Him
From Satan's power and might.""
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm and wind:
And went to Bethlehem straightway
The Son of God to find.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear Saviour lay,
They found Him in a manger,
Where oxen feed on hay;
His Mother Mary kneeling down,
Unto the Lord did pray.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

Now to the Lord sing praises,
All you within this place,
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace;
This holy tide of Christmas
All other doth deface.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

Take warning how you court young men
They're like a bright star on a cloudy morning
They will first appear and then they're gone

They'll tell to you some loving story
To make you think that they love you true
Straightway they'll go and court some other
Oh that's the love that they have for you

Do you remember our days of courting
When your head lay upon my breast
You could make me believe with the falling of your arm
That the sun rose in the West

I wish I were some little sparrow
And I had wings and I could fly
I would fly away to my false true lover
And while he'll talk I would sit and cry

But I am not some little sparrow
I have no wings nor can I fly
So I'll sit down here in grief and sorrow
And try to pass my troubles by

I wish I had known before I courted
That love had been so hard to gain
I'd of locked my heart in a box of golden
And fastened it down with a silver chain

The wind it did whistle and the waters did roar
I heard of fair maiden make a pitiful sound

I expect to live single all the days of my life

My love's gone and left me the one I adore
She's gone where I'll never see her anymore
She plunged her fair body in the waters so deep
She closed her pretty blue eyes in the waters to sleep

Daddy waits, with a patient smile.
They tell him what he's brought into the world,
They all can tell she'll be a daddy's girl.

He hears a voice as she starts to cry,
He looks through the window tears fall from his eyes,
Overwhelmed with the thoughts of the day,
He swears he hears her say

Daddy can you see me?
Daddy can you hear the words I say?
I've got your hands
Your eyes and your hair

And this thing you call a teddy bear.
I'll do what I can to make you proud,
Daddy can you see me now?

He takes me fishing like I'm one of the guys
No one can break these ties that bind.
We've got a bond that's precious and dear,
And it's stayed the same through all these years.

As I get older and time goes by,
He's got a shoulder if I need to cry,
And when I think that I'm going O.K.,
I look at him and say

And every night when I kneel down to pray, 
I wonder if you hear me say

Daddy can you see me?
Daddy can you hear the words I say?
My life has changed since you went away
And I need to know if I'm doing O.K.
I've done all I can to make you proud
Daddy can you see me now?

Oh I've done all I can to make you proud,
Daddy can you see me now?",Daddy Can You See Me
Anita Cochran,"It started at an early age, I guess around 13,
I'd hear those engines on the street and my how they would scream.
They'd pull into the driveway and I would run and hide,
I'd overhear my brothers friends, they'd talk about their rides.
Now momma always told me, ""Don't hang around those boys;
They'll get you into trouble with the cars that make the noise,""
But I had this deep desire, that momma never knew.
Girls like fast cars too.

Girls like fast cars, fast cars too.
But they like them sweet small and petite with an engine that'll cruise.
They don't want to sound like thunder, they want their engines smooth.
Girls like fast cars too.

Drivin' down the street one night, just the girls and me.
We've cruised this town so many times it's the hottest place to be.
A car pulls up beside us as the redlight turns to green.
He's revin' up his engine lord it sounds like a mean machine.
But I took him by surprise with my good old Chevrolet,
And when the race was over he didn't have too much to say.
But by the look that he was wearing, he'd changed his attitude.
Girls like fast cars too.

Anita Cochran,"Staring out my window, who is that I see
He sure does look familiar, and he's wearing boots and jeans
Can't tell you were I saw him, was it on a late night screen
A cowboy in this city's something I ain't never seen
He's knockin' on the door of my two two room flat
Do I let him in, what I would give to love a man like that

[Chorus:]
He walks that western walk, he talks that southern talk
He rides the rodeo, he comes from San Antonio
He's drivin' a big ole Cadillac
Hey, I could love a man like that
Yes, I could love a man like that

He takes me by the hand as he leads me out the door
I say ""Good-Bye ole city, I won't be back here no more""
Well I moved here from the country, thought I'd try and get ahead
Oh but every road I've taken's headed other ways instead
But I've packed up my belongings, and he's handing me the keys
I'm headed to the Mountains with the man of my dreams

Now you may think I'm crazy, but I just can't explain
There's something about a cowboy that drives this girl insane

Anita Cochran,"Don't want to go to the movies
Or spend the day in the park
I don't want no one to call me
I just want to be alone with my heart
And think of the way that you held me
The touch of your lips on my face
Surround myself in your memory

[Chorus]
It's just one of those days
I want to lay in my sorrow
I want to drown in my tears
Don't want to think of tomorrow
Until these thoughts disappear
Then I'll be back on my feet again
Before it's too late
As for now I want to be alone
It's just one of those days
It's just one of those days

I want to think about Texas
Driving the coast of Malibu
Wherever my minds wants to take us
I don't care long as I'm there with you
Why do I put myself through this when
Most of the time I'm okay
But here and now I can feel it

Then I'll be back on my feet again

As for now I want to be alone

Anita Cochran,"Eighteen, a young girl, graduates from school
She's got the future to do the things she wants to do.
Little did she know, she would let her heart give in
The plans she made for life would change so she could be with him.

A baby's born but she knows, their love is just not right,
The pressure's on, is it right or wrong for her to change her life,
Or should she stay committed and hold her feelings deep inside,
Society has got her down and she wants to run wild.

She wants to ride, a horse cross country
She wants to feel, wind brush against her skin
She needs to find, what she's been missing
She wants to ride, until she finds herself again

She got the courage up to go out on her own
She took the little child and found them a new home
She's working now, but it's so hard down at the factory.
With little pay at the end of the day she can barely make ends meet.

Years went by so quickly, though it seemed like time stood still
Standing by her front door, she could feel the winter's chill.
She looks to the horizon where she sees the setting sun
She feels the urge inside her and it makes her want to run

She wants to ride, a horse cross country
She wants to feel, wind brush against her skin
She needs to find, what she's been missing
She wants to ride, until she finds herself again

Even though she's had a rough life,
She wouldn't trade it for the world
The treasures that she owns lie in her little girl.
And when she feels the old desires,
That her troubles often bring
She can go to bed at night and find them in her dreams, where

She wants to ride, a horse cross country
She wants to feel, wind brush against her skin
She needs to find, what she's been missing
She wants to ride, until she finds herself again

Anita Cochran,"We've been friends for a long long time
You tell me your secrets and I tell you mine
She's left you all alone and you feel like no one cares
But I have never failed you I've always been there

You tell your story it sounds a bit like mine
It's the same old situation it happens every time
Can't we see oh maybe you and me
Is what's meant to be
Or do we disagree

What if I told you (what if I said)
That I loved you
How would you feel
What would you think
What would we do
Do we dare cross that line
Between your heart and mine
Or would I lose a friend
Or find a love that would never end
What if I said

She doesn't love you
Oh it's plain to see
I can read between the lines of what your telling me
And he doesn't hold you the way a woman should be held
How long can I go on keeping these feelings to myself

What if I told you -(what if I said)
That I loved you
How would you feel
What would you think
What would we do
Do we dare cross that line
Between your heart and mine
Or would I lose a friend
Or find a love that would never end
What if I said

Oh we've both had our share of loneliness
So who's to say we can't have a little happiness
And if I found that in you
It would make my dreams come true
Or would you walk away
Hear what I have to say

What if I told you -(what if I said)
That I loved you
How would you feel
What would you think
What would we do
Oh do we dare cross that line
Between your heart and mine
I've always wondered
From that day that we met

He's got a picture of a girl in a gown,
He tells his daddy,"" someday you'll see, she will be with me.""
His daddy tells him, "" Son its just not right.
Shes from money boy, she's not your kind.
Don't even call, shell just turn you down.
You're from the wrong side of town.""

But every Sunday after Sunday school
Dressed in his finest hopin' she never knew.
He'd walk her home then he'd say good-bye with tears in his eyes,
She lives uptown in a big white house.
He knows someday but he don't know how.
Lord its not what he prefers, he'll have to break the news to her.
He's from the wrong side of town.

He doesn't have money, no he doesn't have have fortune or fame.
And he doesn't understand why he has to live his life in shame.
But he knows that he loves her, can he make her see somehow,
It shouldn't matter if he's from the wrong side of town.

Next Sunday its the same routin', oh but this time he's wearin' his jeans
He thinks its the last time he'll walk her home, then he'll be alone.
He takes her by the hand the truth he'll face
He knows in his heart she's gonna walk away, but she takes him by surprise.
She looks into his eyes and says "" Your from the wrong side of town.""

It reminds me of the day and the words we said
The thunder and lightning is just about to begin
And I'm out here in the cold that's left over from the storm

'Cause every time it rains your memory comes pouring in
And every drop that falls, it burns like alcohol flowing through my veins
Until the winds of change come and blow the clouds away

I'll still feel the shame and deal with the pain

Maybe I'm foolish and I?ll get through this I know

Anita Cochran,"I was in a band, we were scheduled to appear 
At a little roadhouse called the Get Down Here
A cinder block building with a hand-painted sign
Hunkered down straddling the county lines

When the crowd rolled in they were a motley mix
There were truckers and bikers and locals from the sticks
Each one meaner than a cougar in a cage
And the biggest one swaggered right up to the stage

He said, â??Weâ??ve heard everybody from David Allen Coe 
To Chuck Berry singing â??go Johnny go go
Got an autographed picture of Elvis on the shelf
So tell me girl what you got to say for yourself

I let the guitar do the talkinâ??, and the whole place started rockinâ??
My fingertips werenâ??t stoppinâ?? and that big dude started boppinâ??
No need to fuss, stop the squalkinâ??, just let the guitar do the talkinâ??
Now he was over in the corner with a chesire smile
The best lookinâ?? seventeen miles
Sittinâ?? there makinâ?? my poor heart sweet
I knew my chances were a long shot bet
Because a boy like that heâ??s heard every line
And Iâ??ve never been the silver-tongue kind
But I figured I had me one chance
Of gettinâ?? that boy to dance
So I cranked up my amp...
I let the guitar do the talkinâ??, and the whole place started rockinâ??
My fingertips werenâ??t stoppinâ?? and that big dude started boppinâ??
No need to fuss, stop the squalkinâ??, just let the guitar do the talkinâ??
In a world of too many words 
Sometimes your point is hard to get heard
I think I figured out a little way of getting mine through
I just put it on, tune it up and the whole place started rockinâ??

That when your love wears golden earrings,
She belongs to you.
An old love story that's known to very few,
But if you wear those golden earrings,
Love will come to you.

By the burning fire,they will glow with ev'ry coal.
You will hear desire whisper low inside your soul.
So be my gypsy,
Make love your guiding light,
And let that pair of golden earrings
Cast their spell tonight.",Golden Earrings

Wet night flowers, red and black

Can't get me up
Can't push me up
Can't fill me up

They try to hammer me underground
There is a black rainbow astride
This hallowed ground

Black rainbow I pull it down
I pull it down pull it down
This nervous night this nervous
Nervous night swallows the eye

I drown my hands, I lay them down
The fools seduction tools
Let you go into the sun

Don't push me up
Can't give me up

The dirt delivers me

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I've sinned a lot; I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best

Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank God, I can be oversexed again
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Wise at last, my eyes at last
Are cutting you down to your size at last
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more

Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more

Couldn't eat, was dyspeptic
Life was so hard to bear
Now my heart's antiseptic
Since you moved out of there

Romance, finis, your chance, finis
Those ants that invaded my pants, finis
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more",Bewitched Bothered & Bewildered

A beautiful theme of every

Why can't I let you know,

I wandered down into old Mexico
While I was there
I felt romance everywhere

Moon was shining bright
And I could hear laughing voices in the night
Everyone was gay
This was the start of their holiday

It was fiesta down in Mexico
And so I stopped a while to see the show
I knew that frenesi meant ""Please love me""
And I could say frenesi

A lovely senorita caught my eye
I stood enchanted as she wandered by
And never knowing that it come from me
I gently sighed frenesi

She stopped and raised her eyes to mine
Her lips just pleaded to be kissed
Her eyes were soft as candle-shine

Because her kisses are for me alone

As I'll probably miss a bar,
But if this ditty is not so pretty,
At least it'll tell you how great you are.

You're the top! You're the Colosseum,
You're the top! You're the Louvre Museum,
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss,
You're a Bendel bonnet, a Shakespeart sonnet,
You're Mickey Mouse.
You're the Nile, You're the Tow'r of Pisa,
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa.
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

Your words poetic are not pathetic
On the other hand, boy, you shine
And I can feel after every line
A thrill divine down my spine.
Now gifted humans like Vincent Youmans
Might think that your song is bad,
But for a person who's just rehearsin'
Well I gotta say this my lad:

You're the top! You're Mahatma Ghandi.
You're the top! You're Napolean brandy.
You're the purple light of a summer night in Spain,
You're the National Gall'ry, You're Garbo's sal'ry,
You're cellophane.
You're sublime, You're a turkey dinner.
You're the time of the Derby winner.
I'm a toy balloon that is fated soon to pop.
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

You're the top! You're a Ritz hot toddy.
You're the top! You're a Brewster body.
You're the boats that glide on the sleepy Zuider Zee,
You're a Nathan Panning, You're Bishop Manning,
You're broccoli.
You're a prize, You're a night at Coney,
You're the eyes of Irene Bordoni,
I'm a broken doll, a fol-de-rol, a blop,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top.

You're the top! You're an Arrow collar.
You're the top! You're a Coolidge dollar.
You're the nimble tread of the feet of Fred Astaire,
You're an O'Neill drama, You're Whistler's mama,
You're Camembert.
You're a rose, You're Inferno's Dante,
You're the nost of the great Durante.
I'm just in the way, as the French would say
""De trop,""
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top.

You're the top! You're a Waldorf salad.
You're the top! You're a Berlin ballad.
You're a baby grand of a lady and a gent.
You're an old dutch master, You're Mrs. Aster,
You're Pepsodent.
You're romance, You're the steppes of Russia,
You're the pants on a Roxy usher.
I'm a lazy lout that's just about to stop,
But if Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

You're the top! You're a dance in Bali.
You're the top! You're a hot tamale.
You're an angel, you simply too, too, too diveen,
You're a Botticelli, You're Keats, You're Shelley,
You're Ovaltine.
You're a boon, You're the dam at Boulder,
You're the moon over Mae West's shoulder.
I'm a nominee of the G.O.P. or GOP,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

You're the top! You're the Tower of Babel.
You're the top! You're the Whitney Stable.
By the River Rhine, You're a sturdy stein of beer,
You're a dress from Saks's, You're next year's taxes,'
You're stratosphere.
You're my thoist, You're a Drumstick Lipstick,
You're da foist in da Irish svipstick,
I'm a frightened frog that can find no log to hop,

Anita O'Day,"After one whole quart of brandy
Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no bromo-seltzer handy
I don't even shake

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I've sinned a lot; I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best

Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank God, I can be oversexed again
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Wise at last, my eyes at last
Are cutting you down to your size at last
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more

Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more

Couldn't eat, was dyspeptic
Life was so hard to bear
Now my heart's antiseptic
Since you moved out of there

Those ants that invaded my pants, finis

I was unwise with eyes unable to see

I played the hook.

Sir Charles came from a sanitorium
And yelled for drinks in my emporium
I mixed one drink, he's in memorium

Sir Francis was a singing bird, a nightingale, that's why
I tossed him off my balcony, to see if he, could fly

Across the sea where flying fishes play 
And as the night is falling 
I find that I'm recalling 
That blissful all enthralling day

She said the word I longed to hear her say, 
I tenderly caressed her 
Close to my heart I pressed her 
Upon that golden yesterday

From dusk 'til dawn 
And so I think I'll travel on

They play the game without shame, and who's to blame?

I thought I'd found a man I could trust
What a bust, this is how the story ends
He's gonna turn me down and say
Can't we be friends?

Why should I care?
Though he gave me the air
Why should I cry, heave a sigh and wonder why?

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

Come on and trade in your old dreams for new
Your new dreams for old
I know where they're bought
I know where they're sold
Midnight, you've got to get there at midnight
And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue

Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams

On the street of dreams

All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
 
Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind

Anita O'Day,"I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never a honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

Glasses full of rye
All the news is bad again so
Kiss your dreams goodbye

Sitting in the bars
Knowing neon nights
Missing all the stars

All the sad young men
Drifting through the town
Drinking up the night
Trying not to drown

All the sad young men
Singing in the cold
Trying to forget
That they're growing old

All the sad young men
Choking on their worth
Trying to be brave
Running from the truth

Autumn turns the leaves to gold
Slowly dies the heart
Sad young men are growing old
That's the cruelest part

All the sad young men
Seek a certain smile
Someone they can hold for a little while
Tired little girl does the best she can
Trying to be gay for her sad young man

Watches from above

Guide them home tonight

Anita O'Day,"I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning

Anita O'Day,"Our romance won't end on a sorrowful note,
Though by tomorrow you're gone;
The song is ended, but as the songwriter wrote,
The melody lingers on.
They may take you from me, I'll miss your fond caress.
But though they take you from me, I'll still possess.

The way you wear your hat
The way your sip your tea
The memory of all that
No, no, they can't take that away from me

The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No, no, they can't take that away from me

We may never, never meet again
On the bumpy road to love
Still, I'll always, always keep the memory of

If love must have it's day, then
As it came, let it go.

No, no remorse, no regrets
We should part exactly as we met

We never dreamt of romantic dangers

Life was serene, I knew where I was at
""There's no hope for him,"" my dearest friends would mutter
I was something dragged in by the cat. Then

Just in time, I found you just in time
Before you came my time was running low
I was lost, the losing dice were tossed
My bridges all were crossed, nowhere to go

For love came just in time, you found me just in time
And changed my lonely life that lovely day",Just in Time
Anita O'Day,"Last night I started out happy
Last night my heart was so gay
Last night I found myself dancing
In my favorite cabaret

Just an affair of the past
Then suddenly something happened to me
And I found my heart beating, oh, so fast
 
I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart

Nothin' but blue skies do I see
Bluebirds singin' a song
Nothin' but bluebirds all day long

Never saw the sun shinin' so bright
Never saw things goin' so right
Noticing the days hurrying by
When you're in love, my how they fly

Blue days, all of them gone
Nothin' but blue skies from now on

Anita O'Day,"Emily, Emily, Emily
Has the murmuring sound of may
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

Say Emily, Emily, Emily
And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

(and we fade to a marvelous view)
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family

Anita O'Day,"Let's fall in love
Why shouldn't we fall in love?
Our hearts are made of it
Let's take a chance
Why be afraid of it?

Let's close our eyes
And make our own paradise

Still we can try
To make a go of it

Anita O'Day,"This town is full of guys who think they're mighty wise,
Just because they know a thing or two.
You can see them every day, strolling up and down Broadway,
Telling of the wonders they can do.
You'll see wise guys and boosters,
Card sharps and crap shooters,
They congregate around the Metropole.
They wear those flashy ties and collars,
But where they get their dollars,
They've all got an ace down in the hole.

Some of them write to the old folks for coin,
That's their ace in the hole.
Others have girls on that old tenderloin,
That's their ace in the hole.

They'll tell you of trips they are going to take,
From Frisco up to the North Pole.
But they'd end up on that line, in their clothes not a dime,
If they lost that old ace in the hole.

Wherever you might stray, along the Great White Way,
They'll corner you and start in telling lies.
Of oil wells in Nebraska and gold mines in Alaska,
You'll be immersed in bullshit to your eyes.
But every hustler knows
Bullshit buys no clothes
And only cold cash keeps you off the dole.
So some of them wash dishes,
And some of them are snitches,
But all of them have aces in the hole.

Drifters who dwell on that slippery slope,
Grifters who jump their parole,
Trying to sell bags of catnip for dope,
That's their ace in the hole.

They'll tell you of money they've made and they've spent
And flash a Missouri bankroll.
But their names would be mud,
Like a chump dealing stud
If they lost that old ace in the hole.",Ace in the Hole
Anita O'Day,"You?re my funny valentine
Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet you're my favorite work of art
Is your figure less than Greek

Is your mouth a little weak
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?
But don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little valentine stay
Each day is valentine?s day!",My Funny Valentine [Live]
Anita O'Day,"Chicago, Chicago, that toddlin' town, that toddlin' town
Chicago, Chicago, I'll show you around, I love it
Betcha bottom dollar you'll lose your blues
In Chicago, Chicago
The town that Billy Sunday could not shut down

On State Street, that great street
I just want to stay, I just want to stay
They do things they don't do on Broadway, say
They have the time, the time of their life

I saw a man who danced with his wife
In Chicago, Chicago, Chicago, Chicago
Free and easy town, brassy, breezy town
Chicago, Chicago

Let me cool my heels right down at Marshall Field
Come and walk with
Along the lake, to the drake
Hollar and hoot, all through the loop

Shout out now to Mrs. O'Leary's cow
No she-she, life is peachy
Chicago, we'll meet at the Pump Room Ambassador East
To say the least

On shishkabob and breast of squab we will feed and get free
Don't tell me sin is rampid and right
Think of that man who danced with his wife
In Chicago, Chicago 
I feel sympathy for that wonderful, windy town!",Chicago
Anita O'Day,"Never thought I'd fall,
But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind,
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me
Because I'm sentimental over you

Anita O'Day,"See that train coming round the bend,
Carrying the one that I love
Her beautiful body is still here on earth,
But her soul has been called up above

Body and soul, body and soul,
That's how she loved me, with body and soul

Her beautiful hair was the purest of gold,
Her eyes were as blue as the sea,
Her lips were the color of summer's red rose,
And she promised she would always love me

Tomorrow as the sun sinks low
The shadows will cover her face
As her last sun goes down, she's laid beneath the ground
And my teardrops are falling like rain",Body & Soul
Anita O'Day,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

But our love is here to stay",Our Love Is Here to Stay
Anita O'Day,"Someday, when I'm awfully low
And the world is cold
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight

Yes, you're lovely
With your smile so warm, and your cheek so soft
There is nothing for me but to love you
Just the way you look tonight

With each word your tenderness grows
Tearing my fear apart
And that smile that wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart

Lovely, never, never change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it, 'cause I love you
Just the way you look tonight
Just the way you look tonight",Just the Way You Look Tonight
Anita O'Day,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear

That I adore you, dear
But grant me
Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame

For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above

So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every homefire burning for
We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together

That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
'Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",You'd Be So Easy to Love
Anita O'Day,"You're nobody till somebody loves you
You're nobody till somebody cares
You might be king, you might possess, the world and its gold
But gold won't bring you happiness, when you're growing old

The world still is the same
You'll never change it
As sure as the stars shine above
You're nobody till somebody loves you
So find yourself somebody to love",You're Nobody 'Til Somebody Loves You
Anita O'Day,"You took my kisses and all my love
You taught me how to care
Am I to be just remnant of a one side love affair

All you took
I gladly gave
There is nothing left for me to save

All of me
Why not take all of me
Can't you see
I'm no good without you
Take my lips
I want to loose them
Take my arms
I'll never use them

So why not take all of me",All of Me

You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea
I forgive you, 'cause I can't forget you

[Repeat: x2]
I ought to cross you off my list
But when you come a-knocking at my door
Fate seems to give my heart a twist
And I come running back for more
I should hate you, but I guess I love you

Anita O'Day,"Twenty-five cents, hah, no, no
I wouldn't pay twenty-five cents to go in nowhere
'Cause listen here

Up in Harlem every Saturday night
When the highbrows get together its just too tight
They all congregates at an all night strut
And what they do is tut-tut-tut

Old Hannah Brown from 'cross town
Gets full of corn and starts breakin' 'em down
Just at the break of day
You can hear old Hannah say

Because he's bringin' me down!

Anita O'Day,"It's not the pale moon that excites me 
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
It's just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
It's just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",Nearness of You
Anita O'Day,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past

Anita O'Day,"Picture a penthouse way up in the sky
With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by
A sweet slice of heaven for just you and I
When we're alone

From all of society we'll stay aloof
And live in propriety there on the roof
Two heavenly hermits, we will be in truth
When we're alone

We'll view life's mad pattern
As we view old Manhattan
Then we can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are

In our little penthouse we'll always contrive
To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson, just over the drive
When we're alone",Penthouse Serenade
Anita O'Day,"I was a stranger in the city  
Out of town were the people I knew  
I had that feeling of self-pity  
What to do? What to do? What to do?  
The outlook was decidedly blue  
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone  
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day in London Town  
Had me low and had me down  
I viewed the morning with alarm  
The British Museum had lost its charm  
How long, I wondered, could this thing last?  
But the age of miracles hadn't passed,  
For, suddenly, I saw you there 
And through foggy London Town

Naci un dia de junio
Del año 77
Planeta mercurio
Y el año de la serpiente
Sin o patente
Tatuado y en mi frente
Que en el vientre de mi madre
Marcaba el paso siguiente
Me hace llorar
Sin anestesia en la camilla
Mi padre solo dijo es Ana Maria
Si seria el primer llanto
Que me probaría
Quemando las heridas
Y dándome la batería
Solía ser entonces como un libro abierto
Pero leí la letra pequeña del texto
Como un arquitecto
Construyendo cada efecto
Correcto, incorrecto, sé aprender todo al respecto
Saber que algunas personas
Queran el daño
Subir peldaño
Toma tiempo toma año
Con mi peluche mirando lo cotidiano
Dibujos transformaban
Y el invierno en gran verano
Papa me regalo bajo mi insistenso
Juego, trataba de culparte y recibencia
Pero en el cartu hicieron la competencia
Y fue cuando senti mi primera impotencia

Todo lo que cambia lo hará diferente
En el año que nació la serpien

Mi adolescencia
Fue una etapa bizarra
El cuerpo es batería
Y la cabeza guitarra
La orquesta narronato
Nada quebrada para la mirada
De una niña que solo talla espadas
Hormona disparada
Sobre poblada sin formas
En que cambian temporadas
Caminas en crucijadas
Cada cual es su morada
Preparaba la carnada
La sagrada diablada
De mirada encabronada
Mi fila la verdad
Nunca busco su silla
Mi búsqueda fue mero
Proceso de pura pila
Pupila de poeta
Que marco nuestra saliba
En la cordillera que miraba la salida
La parada militar de paso monótono
Colores policromolos
Uniformes de poco tono
Detono mi cuestionamento
La voz si sonó no
Mi primera rima que sonó
Y me enrrolo
Mi búsqueda no fue para mi cosa de escenario
Fue algo necesario
Que marcaba ya mi fallo
Así que todas
Mas de lo necesario
Fue cuando entendí
Que todos quieren ser corsario
