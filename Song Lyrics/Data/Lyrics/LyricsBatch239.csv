Katherine Jenkins,"As you find your way through this life you make
I hope you live each day for all it's worth
Go where your heart leads and dream your biggest dreams
All of these things I will pray for you

I will pray for you, I will pray for you
Through every darkness, through every light
This road ahead of you, I cannot carry you
But I can promise I will pray for you

If a love so true breaks your heart in two
And it hurts so much that you can't forgive
And even the smallest step feels like miles away
But you'll get there one day, I will pray for you

I will pray for you, I will pray for you
Through every darkness, through every light
This road ahead of you, I cannot carry you
But I can promise I will pray for you

So if you ever start to wonder
If you're in this world alone
I'll be there to help you over
If you lose your way, if you lose your faith

When your time is through my final wish for you
Is to count you blessings not your regrets
With peace inside your soul and all that heaven holds
I hope you always know I will pray for you

I will pray for you, I will pray for you
Through every darkness, through every light
This road ahead of you, I cannot carry you
But I can promise I will pray for you
But I can promise I will pray for you

",I Will Pray For You

Katherine Jenkins,"Once I had a secret love
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love
Became impatient to be free

So I told a friendly star
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are
And why I'm so in love with you

Now I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my heart's an open door
And my secret love's no secret anymore

Now I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my heart's an open door
And my secret love's no secret anymore

",Secret Love
Katherine Jenkins,"My silent wish is to be back with you
The love I left I can't forget
It would kill me if you knew

My silent words are all I have to say
There was no doubt it would all work out
When I walked away

Too late to turn it all around
Too late to say I'm sorry now

Strong, sure and proud, regrets not allowed
Too scared to let it out
I hope in silence, I pray in silence
And I shout in silence

I can see right where I want to be
But it's hard to heal and it's impossible to feel
When your heart's not free

It hurts knowing I was wrong
It hurts but I will carry on

Strong, sure and proud, regrets not allowed
Too scared to let it out
I hope in silence, I shout in silence

What do I feel? Tell me what do I feel?
And what's the use of turning back the time?
The more that I say seems the more that I pay
It's best for now to keep it all inside, deep inside

So strong, sure and proud, regrets they're not allowed
It's too late to shout it out, it's too late to shout it out
I hope in silence, I pray in silence
I shout in silence

",Shout In Silence
Katherine Jenkins,"So here we are
Waking from the shadows to the sun
So near so far
Feeling like our journey's just begun

All we hope and reach for
Sometimes can't be found
While we have the chance
Let's live for now

Viva tonight, I'm by your side
Viva our star our guiding light
Viva the dream we hold inside
Viva the love the love we share tonight

So hand in hand
Together we are stronger we belong
We understand
Here is where our hearts can be as one

If we lose direction
We'll get home somehow
So while we have the chance
Let's live for now

Faces faces all around us
We don't see them now we've found us
We have founds us

",Viva Tonight

Katherine Jenkins,"Ancora non sai
Che mi incontrerai
In un tuo sogno distratto

Mi guarderai e comprenderai senza che debba parlarti
E non mi stupirò quando ti accorgerai
Di volermi lì
Sulle labbra

Mi respirerai e ti inebriero
Poi rincorrerrai
Il ricordo di me
Soffice mi sfiorerai
Prima di stringermi
Con l'aria fondermi
Mentre il tempo ci cullera

Spesso, vedrai mi perderai
Come non fossi reale

Ma tornerai
E mi coglierai
Come il più raro tra i fiori
E non ti stupirai
Quando mi accorgero
Che il tuo posto è tra le mie braccia

Mi respirerai e ti inebriero
Poi rincorrerrai
Il ricordo di me
Soffice mi sfiorerai
Prima di stringermi
Con l'aria fondermi
Mentre il rempo ci cullera",Ancora Non Sai
Katherine Jenkins,"Spend all your time waiting for that second chance
For the break that will make it okay
There's always one reason to feel not good enough""
And it's hard at the end of the day
I need some distraction, oh beautiful release
Memories seeps from my veins
They may be empty and weightless, and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight

In the arms of an angel, fly away from here
From this dark, cold hotel room, and the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel, may you find some comfort there

So tired of the straight line, and everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back
The storm keeps on twisting, you keep on building the lies
That you make up for all that you lack
It don't make no difference, escaping one last time
It's easier to believe
In this sweet madness, oh this glorious sadness
That brings me to my knees

In the arms of an angel, fly away from here
From this dark, cold hotel room, and the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage of your silent reverie

Katherine Jenkins,"How can you see into my eyes like open doors
Leading you down into my core
Where I've become so numb
Without a soul
My spirit sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home

Wake me up inside
Wake me up inside
Call my name and save me from the dark
Bid my blood to run
Before I come undone
Save me from the nothing I've become

Now that I know what I'm without
You can´t just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real
Bring me to life

Wake me up inside
Wake me up inside
Call my name and save me from the dark
Bid my blood to run
Before I come undone
Save me from the nothing I've become

Bring me to life

Frozen inside without your touch
Without your love darling
Only you are the life among the dead

Bid my blood to run
Before I come undone
Save me from the nothing I've become",Bring Me to Life

Katherine Jenkins,"The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world
In sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth

A thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
Oh, hear the angels' voices
O night divine
O night, when Christ was born
O night divine
O night, O night divine

Katherine Jenkins,"When you're alone, silence is all you see
When you're alone, silence is all you'll be
Give me your hand and come to me

When you are here, music is all around
When you are near, music is all around
Open your eyes, don't make a sound

Let in the shadow, let in the shadow
Let in the light of your bright shadow

Let in the shadow, let in the shadow
Let in the light of your bright shadow",Abigail's Song [From Doctor Who 'A Christmas Carol'] [*]
Katherine Jenkins,"Something in the way you held me
Heaven in the words you said
Tonight I'm looking at the open window
Liyng in our empty bed

I try in vain to remember
So afraid to forget
How light the snow was falling last December
On your silhouette

Clinging to a memory of you
Lying by a winter's flame
The night I told you a was born to love you
And how I'd never be the same

For as long as I'm living
I'll will always regret
How all the tme I never took a picture
Of your silhouette

I used to close my eyes
And only see your face
But time was made to fly
And carry you away

How light the snow was falling last December
On your silhouette

Oh, and maybe if I try to listen
I can hear you call my name
From out across the great and mighty distance
Something like an open sea

Helping me to remember
So afraid to forget
How light the snow was falling last December
On your silhouette",Your Silhouette
Katherine Jenkins,"Where did I misplace my faith
Where did I set it down
Which one the day that I forgot
What this was all about
And I came so close
To throwing it all away
But I'm taking it back again

So come and rejoice
Come and rejoice
What was lost is found

When did I get so sensible
Make me a fool again
My life was a half empty glass
Now it is full again
And this road we take
Is never an easy place
But somehow we've found our way

So come and rejoice
Come and rejoice
And you don't even have to make a sound
I feel it in your touch
You sing it with you eyes
What was lost is found

So come and rejoice
Come and rejoice
What was lost is what was lost is
What was lost is found
What was lost is found",Rejoice
Katherine Jenkins,"Nighttime sharpens, heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
Silently the senses abandon their defenses
Helpless to resist the notes I write
For I composed the music of the night

Slowly, gently, night unfurls its splendor
Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender
Hearing is believing, music is deceiving
Hard as lightning, soft as candle light
Dare you trust the music of the night

Close your eyes for your eyes will only tell the truth
And the truth isn't what you want to see
In the dark it is easy to pretend
That the truth is what it ought to be

Softly
Deafening
Music shall caress you
Hear it
Feel it
Secretly posses you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness which you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night

Close your eyes, start a journey through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before
Close your eyes and let music set you free
Only then can you belong to me

Floating, falling
Sweet intoxication
Touch me
Touch me
Trust me
Trust me
Savor each sensation

Let the dream begin
Let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night

You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the
Help me make the music of the night
",Music of the Night [As used in the film The Phantom of the Opera]
Katherine Jenkins,"Away in a manger,
No crib for His bed,
The little Lord Jesus
Laid down His sweet head;
The stars in the heavens
Looked down where He lay,
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay.

The cattle are lowing,
The poor Baby wakes,
But little Lord Jesus,
No crying He makes.
I love Thee, Lord Jesus;
Look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle
Till morning is nigh.

Be near me, Lord Jesus;
I ask Thee to stay
Close by me forever
And love me I pray!
Bless all the dear children
In Thy tender care,
And fit us for Heaven
To live with Thee there.

Like I've never seen the sky before

Seasons may change, winter to spring
But I love you until the end of time

Come what may
Come what may
I will love you until my dying day

Suddenly the world seems such a perfect place
Suddenly it moves with such a perfect grace
Suddenly my life doesn't seem such a waste
It all revolves around you
And there's no mountain too high
No river too wide
Sing out this song and I'll be there by your side
Storm clouds may gather
And stars may collide
But I love you until the end of time

Come what may
Come what may
I will love you until my dying day

Kathie Baillie,"There's no king when love is the thing
We play the same rules
In a heartbeat a wiseman can be a fool
There's no guarantee that love will be

A stranger or a friend
A prayer that's answered 
Or a heartache that never ends
Through the darkest hours 
When all is said and done
It has the power
You go from lonely to the lucky one

Love's funny that way
Now matter who you are
It can shake your faith
Or it can break your heart
Once in a while the mountains move
We all long for those days
You live, you laugh, you say
Love's funny that way

Not long ago I got to know the lonely side
Just me and my pain and nowhere to hide
It amazes me
How my world turned around
If it's meant to be
That's all that matters to me anyhow

Love's funny that way
No matter who you are
It can shake your faith
Or it can break your heart
Once in a while the mountains move
We all long for those days
You live, you laugh, you say
Love's funny that way

Once in a while the mountains move
We all long for those days

On Mary's lap is sleeping? 
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet, 
While shepherds watch are keeping? 
This, this is Christ the King, 
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing: 
Haste, haste to bring him laud, 
The babe, the son of Mary. 

Why lies he in such mean estate 
Where ox and ass are feeding? 
Good Christian, fear: for sinners here 
The silent Word is pleading. 
Nails, spear shall pierce Him through, 
The Cross be borne for me, for you; 
Hail, hail, the Word made flesh, 
The Babe, the Son of Mary. 

So bring him incense, gold, and myrrh, 
Come, peasant, king, to own him.

You talked me through the hard times
And held me through goodbyes

But never realized

Of how it would be
Say that you feel it too
Tell me now

Kathleen Battle,"Away in a manger, no crib for his bed,
the little Lord Jesus laid down his Sweet head.
The stars in the bright sky looked down where he lay,
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.

The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes,
But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.
I love thee, Lord Jesus! Look down from the sky,
And stay by my side until morning is nigh.

Be near me, Lord Jesus; I ask thee to stay
Close by me forever, and love me, I pray.
Bless all the dear children in thy tender care,
And fit us for heaven, to live with thee there.",Away in a Manger

A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

For something she once had and never could be found
Time was on her side but she never kept track
All the hunters came and took her memories back

Once they met inside a dirty curtained room
And the rain fell down hard that day onto the tin roof
She said ""I've seen you before, I've been looking for you
Better keep your heart close hunters are coming for you""
He said ""I've seen them a hundred times and I always get away
'Cuz you will never stop looking and I will never stay""

You always blame it on the cheapest key
You always play me in the cheapest key

But don't get me wrong
Here comes my softer side and there it goes
'Cause I've been on the road too long to sympathize

Kathleen Edwards,"You know what I wish?
It was just you and me,
Sitting in this corner bar
You could tell me how your are
But I'm not gonna lie,
Or anything...
You don't even have to speak,
If you keep looking at me

Well I could go all night,
But they're turning up the lights
It would be so easy,
(To) do or say anything
And I'm not gonna lie
I'm not looking for love...
I won't let you in my heart
But you were always on my mind","Goodnight, California"
Kathleen Edwards,"Blazing a trail to the southern cities from the streets of our hometown
Basement bars, we played from the heart in the company of our friends
If I write down these memories that I have saved away
Photographs of the years that have passed inside my little brain

[Chorus]
You're cool and cred like Fogerty,
I'm Elvis Presley in the 70ths
You're Chateau Neuf,
I'm Yellow Label
You're the buffet,
I'm just the table
I'm a Ford Temple,
You're a Maserati
You're The Great One,
I'm Marty McSorley
You're the Concord,
I'm economy
I make the dough,
But you get the glory

Big fish, small pond and some cover songs that we sang along the way
We used to midnight run to The Vesta Lounge,cheese burgers and chocolate shakes
And once I got drunk with Jeb, I told him I was in love with you
But I love you like a brother so I guess that half of it was true

[Chorus]

If I write down these memories that I have saved away
Photographs of the years that have passed inside my little brain.

Kathleen Edwards,"Oh Canada
I stand on guard for a lot
But just last week a white girl was shot
Outside a shopping mall
Yea, it's written in the press
That your sweet little town
Has lost it's innocence

It's not the year of the gun
We don't say it out loud
There are no headlines
When a black girl dies
It's not the lack of a sense
It's called ambivalence

All still in their lanes
Under rush hour lights
There's one head to a car
But you act so surprised
When the snow don't come
You can't swim in the lakes
Now it's hotter than hell
In a bed you won't make

It's not the lack of a sense
It's called ambivalence

Up on the hill
Is the best real estate
Just to get in
You have to sell off your faith
'Cuz in the valley below
There is crack and young girls
But you don't have to believe
What stays out of your world",Oh Canada

He said those cars they used to drive were the best

From his neighbor bought round toe shoes

Kathleen Edwards,"Oh, my child thirty years today
You came into my life
And everything changed
If there's one thing I tried to teach you
Girl, don't you waste your time
Come this September
You'll be somebody's wife

I won't paint a picture
Of what you want to see
Love is the harder times
Take it from me

I would run down the lane
And into the night
Run so fast I swear my feet would fly
Run from my babies asleep in their beds
Run from my lover and my best friend
And back again

All of this courage
I've tried so hard to hold on to
Ever since that day
You and your brother left for school
They say just over that hill
The fog rolled in
Come quick doctor
We think somebody's been killed

I have been a healer
Of other people's pain
I know sometimes you don't like
The ways I've changed

But the smell of the world came into my lungs
The sound of the gravel when my legs went numb
And my heart nearly burst right out of my chest
And it felt so good to know I wasn't dead",Run
Kathleen Edwards,"As a child I would wake at night
I was scared but I kept real quiet
Shadows on the walls moving in on me...
And underneath my sheets I could barely breathe
And your room was only just across the hall
All it would have taken was a single call
But maybe sometimes we've got to trust ourselves not to scream out loud, and run like hell...

[Chorus]
Believe me, all our days here are unsure
Believe in me, I don't want to anymore
And in the dark, picture me in your mind
And I'll lay with you
You don't have to be scared at night

As a young man you were shooting rats
By accident you hit the farmyard cat
He ran for the fields and came back the next day
You'd blown out his eye and you could see his brain
That's it boy, there is some things in life, you don't want to do, but you know is right
So take him out back and finish him off
Got your gun off the shelf, it only took one shot

[Chorus]

And I flew away and I paid on your final day
They said that you waited 'til I came
We sang your favorite hymns and we held your hand
You took your final breath and that was that
But I'd never seen a person die before
I tried so hard not to cry and all...
'Cause maybe sometimes we've got to trust ourselves, that when you die you go some place else

You don't have to be scared at night",Scared at Night

Has never been my strength
I've been known to be vague
And often pointless
But you sure as shit know me
Better than anybody else
And for that in my heart I am hopeful

So I helped you pack your bags
And I folded up your snap shirts
When you come back
It will already be the winter
If you look at other girls
Working out in the nighttime
I don't mind but I don't want to know it

And these years that I have known you
It's gone and blurred my sense of time
Now I can hardly even recall
What came before this
Letters left on pillows
Messages left on phones
Postcards in the mail
When we sent them
Cobwebs all collected
Paintings on the walls
Lounging around all day
In a hot pink chenille housecoat
And the secrets that I whispered
In your ear while you were sleeping
You can call to mind when you're
Out in the world without me

Oh the denim king
I sure as shit do love you
And I cuss because I mean it
And for that in my heart I am hopeful
And these words that I chose
I was so careful",Sure as Shit

Going home
And we're never going to feel the same

I still see her dark eyes glowing
She was twenty one, when I left Galveston

I still see her standing by the water
Standing there looking out to sea

Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two

Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you

Kathleen Holeman,"When autumn sings her lullaby
And green leaves turn to gold
Then I remember last September
You and I said goodbye
Whispering that we would be returning
When autumn comes again

Now autumn roams the hills once more
But you forgot your vow
Now here am I with, alone with only memories
Only lonely memories, autumn memories of you

Love, when the leaves are turning
I get a hungry yearning for your arms
Love, when a heart is so blue
It shadows bright October's golden charm

The flaming moon reminds me of
The night of love that we once knew
Each tiny star is but a prayer
That when it's fall again, love will call again
And you'll be beside me to make
My autumn dreams come true

As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be

Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

Like the kicker in a julep or two

And she said there was no music

And I made the beatles appear

You lit every dark corner
Made the air feel like it was dancing
Your eyes like an old coloured vinyl
Were hiding in grooves a smile
Like a sweet aria

I was searching for something divine
And ended up making the mundane into my shrine
And we all know
A little but we're tricked by the same sense of wanting
Like silence mistaken for knowing
Like a desert's mistaken for sea
Like a tongue has a mother
We belong to each other
We belong to each other

Is so overrated
Complete darkness
Is so embracive
And as we travelled north
There were crows and seagulls
Stood on either side
Like angels and demons
And we knew what we wanted to hear
The wind singing like your sweet aria

And the clouds blew at shadows
Tricked by the same sense of wanting
Like silence mistaken for knowing
Like a desert's mistaken for sea
Like a tongue has a mother

Good people are in bed before nine o'clock.

On the pad before my eyes, paper cries, telling lies,
The promises you gave from the grave of a broken heartâ?¦
Hmmmâ?¦

Every day I spend my time drinking wine, feeling fineâ?¦
Waiting here to find the sign that I can understand, yes, I am.
Oooooh!

I sit here in my lonely roomâ?¦

Don't push your love too far.
You know your wounds won't even leave a scar.
Right now is where you areâ?¦
In a broken dream!
And don't forget what I said?

Hoooooo!

Ivory towersâ?¦
Bloody flowers



",In a Broken Dream
Kathryn Williams,"(Pavement)

However you feel, whatever it takes
Whenever it's real, whatever awaits
Whatever you need, however so slight
Whenever it's real, whenever it's right

I'll be thinking long and hard
About the things you said to me
Like a bitter stranger
Now I see the long and short
And never ever what's in between

I could spit on a stranger
You're a bitter stranger

Whatever you feel, whatever it takes
Whenever it's real, whatever awaits me
Whatever you need, however so slight
Wherever it leads, whenever it's right

Honey, I'm a prize and you're a catch
And we're a perfect match
Like two bitter strangers
And now I see the long and short of it
And I could make it last

I could spit on a stranger
You're a bitter stranger
Well, I could spit on a stranger
You're a bitter stranger

I see the sunshine in your eyes
I'll try the things you'll never try
I'll be the one that leaves you high

Kathryn Williams,"Won't you let me walk you home from school?
Won't you let me meet you at the pool?
Maybe Friday I can get tickets for the dance
And I'll take you

Won't you tell your dad, ""Get off my back""?
Tell him what we said about 'Paint it black'
Rock 'n' roll is here to stay
Come inside where it's okay and I'll shake you

Won't you tell me what you're thinking of?
Would you be an outlaw for my love?
If it's so, well, let me know
If it's no, well, I can go, I won't make you

Kathryn Williams,"Have you been crying to yourself
Is your imagination ever going to stop
Dressed in brown to match the seine
Your eyes like dark windows
Your brain's working faster than the cars

Let it happen relax
Don't try to fight it
It's slipped away and it's never
Coming back

The sky open and blue
Like the letters that came from Africa
We look at drawings of lions
And imagine them sat by gas fires
Sat by gas fires

Let it happen relax
Don't try to fight it
It's slipped away and it's never
Coming back

I want to cry but I can't
Like when it's too cold to snow
The day I left the wind blew shut
Velvet curtains
I became older

Kathryn Williams,"Nights have fallen down on you
Because of him
Claustrophobic, sleeping hot
Law can't keep the power
That you want within

But who is your future resting its head upon?
Will you love in the same way?
Or will it come back unopened?

Change came unexpected
Like it always does
You either move with it
Or run away from it's clutches
But it will come back

Where is you future going to settle down?
Will you move pushing boundaries?
Or leave them unopened?

Is this your future holding back your heart?
Keeping it at a distance
To never be unopened
To never be opened

Kathryn Williams,"My name is sandy L sandy L
I named myself after myself
I watch people and people watch me
The best time is when they sleep

I'm going to dream of dreaming

My name is sandy L sandy L
Sometimes I end up talking to myself
I can see them and they can see me
Laid flat like a closed book
Closed to you closed to me

I'm going to dream of dreaming

Streets aren't so easy for me
You need a place to go and a place you've been
My hardware is humming with me
That and you on the screen keeps me company

You don't need to know people to love them,
As long as you don't want to own them

I'm going to dream of dreaming

My name is sandy L sandy L
It's my password, my logo, my business, my shadow
I've switched off and I've shut down
I can see the lights from the town going out going out

Kathryn Williams,"When all the nights have come
When all the day time goes
When all the work is done what then

When your lovers come
When your love has gone
When a touch comes down on who it's meant to rest on

We've saved for a time
That may not come
Working for names above doors
To get everything done
We're flapping about for a week in the sun

Is there someone there?
A click on the line
Are you playing a game?
For a call I'll be waiting

When you sat at your table
When you drank yourself silly
Just to forget that in the week they own your energies

We've saved for a time
That may not come
Working for names above doors
To get everything done
We're flapping around for a week in the sun

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

 That saved a wretch like me. 
 I once was lost but now I'm found, 
 Was blind but now I see. 
 T'was grace that taught my heart to fear 
 And grace my fear relieved 
 How precious did that grace appear, 
 The hour I first believed. 
 Through many dangers, toils and snares 
 We have already come 
 T'was grace that brought us safe thus far 
 And grace will lead us home.

 We've no less days to sing God's praise 
 Than when we first begun",Amazing Grace

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

I know this room, I've walked this floor

There was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show it to me, do you?
And remember when I moved in you
The holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe there’s a God above
But all I’ve ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
It’s not a cry you can hear at night
It’s not somebody who has seen the light
It’s a cold and it’s a broken Hallelujah

Up and down the road home is letting me down

I thought you said the thorns had been pulled from the rose

To me that was the message in the quake of eighty-nine

CHORUS:
The earth went bang, there were two big waves
That earthquake made a lot of things shake
Everyone was saved, had time to thank --- why didn't you take the time ---
To thank God, why didn't you

Kathy Kallick,"I recall those thrilling nights
Transistor lying under my pillow
I harbor still the secret vice
Knowing something that nobody knows

When did the magic steal your soul
Fill your senses and rock your bones
Your steadfast lover through the night
When did you fall for the radio

CHORUS:

I miss your laughter, I miss your voice
I miss your whisper soft and low
I'd trade all this empty noise
Wish I could hear you on the radio
If I could hear you on the radio



We trace our stories through the time
This song's yours and this one's mine
No one thing can recall a moment
Quite like a song from the radio

I remember and you do too
Where you heard all the fateful news
Our heroes died on the radio
Where were you when we walked on the moon

CHORUS

It's dark, it's late, I'm all alone
Driving down some unknown road
Foot on the dashboard, hair blowin'
I got the window rolled down low
Straining for familiar tones
Here comes your voice on the radio

CHORUS

",Radio
Kathy Kallick,"I was workin' overtime in the town of Lorraine
Right between Odessa and Abeline
Feelin' like somethin' that the cat dragged in
The whole place looked a little worse than me

I left work and walked straight through town
With the wind at my back and the sun goin' down
I got home and turned right around
My TV chair was no place for me

CHORUS:

There was a two-bit moon in a ten-cent sky
On a west Texas night with the clouds rollin' by
All lit up just like the fourth of July
I'll feel a little better as the hours go by


I left home with the screen door slammin'
And I went to a club where the band was jammin'
You know what they say about feast or famine
They were all linin' up just to dance with me

I had my red shirt on, I was hot I can tell ya
I was just warmin' up at a quarter to eleven
Thought I might have died and gone to heaven
How did this happen to a girl like me

CHORUS

I'm gonna take that moon like a big yellow quarter
Gonna put it in the juke box and place my order
Dance 'til my feet hurt and kick up my heels
Sing y'all a song 'bout the way that it feels

CHORUS
",Red Shirt
Kathy Kallick,"Questions remain unanswered, there's so much left unsaid
So many conversations I've had with you inside my head
What did you do with the letters, do they lie somewhere still unread
What do you do with the pictures still runnin' around inside your head

CHORUS:

I'm gonna save everything
'Cause I've started to think
When I'm old and grey
There might come a day
I'm gonna need love letters like that


Some of the gifts you gave still travel around with me
They're tiny precious tokens of a love that used to be
What did you do with the gifts I gave, are they somewhere inside a box
And how would it be if you and I ever had the time to talk

CHORUS

I guess most of what we said was always somewhere between the lines
Most of what you gave me is still somewhere inside my own mind
Now it's too bad about a new love because there's still a place inside
Where you and I are rockin' and talkin' late into the night

CHORUS:
I'm gonna save everything
'Cause I've started to think
There might come a day
Before I'm old and grey
I'm gonna need love letters like that
Yeah, I'm gonna need love letters like that

Kathy Kallick,"A darkened sky with gorgeous light
From the west through the middle of the night
The moon is always golden when it's clearing
The cascades tousled, tumbling down
To a prism patchwork on the ground
The sky is clear, blue-grey just like your eyes
While tiny boat masts sway beneath those skies

CHORUS:

Love you, yes, I always will
Think of you and time stands still
I will always see you in Seattle
The many places we have been
Times and faces we have seen
In my mind I see you in Seattle


I see you hitch-hiking in the rain
Sleeping on the sand off the coast of Spain
Laughing up your sleeve in some cafe in Vienna
Me a painter, you a poet
Through the years though we don't show it
We're both afraid we've lost track of these talents
Yet in each other we find a sense of balance

CHORUS

Now you say that place is full of ghosts
You think you'd like to travel to the other coast
I wonder will the distance really maker a difference
'Cause wherever you go, well, there you are
And a well of sadness can reach so far
If only you could see yourself the way that I do
Wherever you go, my heart will be beside you

CHORUS

",See You in Seattle
Kathy Kallick,"I took a minute to think of you before I sailed upon a silent sea
I took the time to review the careful kinds of things you always said to me
You never said you were in love
You only told me just enough
You never said you were in love
You only said that it was circumstance
You didn't think it wise to take that kind of chance
We didn't have to fly, we only wanted one slow dance
Let's dance

It doesn't always take a fool to ask a simple question give an answer yes or no
A fool ain't gonna see the writing on the wall, hit you on the head, you know-it-all
You never said you were in love
You talked about a lot of stuff
You never said you were in love
Did you think you were the only one to ever think of that
The man with all the facts
Was it a cautious act or was it ceremonial chat
Chit-chat

If we had never had a single kiss, we wouldn't find ourselves in a fix like this
But when you think of all the empty faces in a single day, too bad you didn't say
You were in love, you never said
You only acted so stuck up
I should have known
You were in love
It took the distance of a thousand nights
And all the time of space
To finally see the brightest light

Heart on my sleeve, out on a limb
I'm lost at sea, no help in sight
I should have known
You were in love

[Darlin', you send me ... ]

Girls, I'm about to tell you something You may wanna know
You know things they're not always
What they appear to be
And I don't want to happen to you
What happened to me

Listen, There are no words that can describe, what I felt inside
When I found out the man I loved loved another guy
We were at a party, Ohh to have a little fun
But when I looked around my-my man was missing
I walked outside, I couldn't believe my eyes
He was in Bill's arms breathin hard and french kissin

I was ready for Mary, Susan, Helen and Jane
When all the time it was Bill who was sleeping with my man

Bill has been to my house a thousand times
He and my man would go camping and fishing
Oh I tell you it never crossed my mind
Bill was a friend and he was God Uncle to my only son
Now it looks Uncle Billy wants to be his step-mom

Now you see I was ready for Mary, I was ready for Jane
How do a woman compete with a man for another man

I asked my man why didnt you tell me that you were gay
when you knew, knew I build my world around you
I knew I had those feelings and I didn't want it to be
I thought by being with you, Girl I thought it would change
As tears came to my eyes, hesays I'm sorry I hurt you so
I got to pack Bill is waiting for me and I got to go

I was ready for Mary, I was ready for Jane
When all the time it was Bill who was sleeping with my man
Thank you for using Top40db.com.

I don't feel ashame and I don't take the blame
My man was just a queen, he was a Queen that thought he was a King
He told before he left he said
I know you're hurt and oh I know you're mad
But if that's not asking too much,
could you tell my son I love him and I'm still his dad

I was ready for Mary, Susan, Helen and Jane
When all the time it was Bill who was sleeping with my man

I was ready for Mary, Susan, Helen and Jane
When all the time it was Bill who was sleeping with my man
Bill used to come over to my house, I used to fix him my food
I used to loan Bill my money, all the time he was in there tryin' to get

I love my mister man,
And I can't tell yo' why,
There ain't no reason
Why I should love that man.
It must be something that the angels done plan.

I got to love one man till I die.

Tell me he's lazy, tell me he's slow,
Tell me I'm crazy (maybe I know).

But when he comes back that day is fine,

Well, I'm leaving West Virginia in the morning
And I'm headin' out that California way
I don't know what I'll find but baby it's my time
And I'll surely leave my heart below the Mason-Dixon line
I've seen a lot of folks 'round the street tonight
Can't seem to find the words to say goodbye
We're close enough to touch but speaking is too much
And goodbyes are heard without a word
And they're much more than enough
My mama and my daddy they don't know what to say
They just can't bring themselves to understand
They think I run away, but to run would be to stay
Cause the things you want are only worth the price you have to pay
What is home but a place you keep within your heart
And call on when you need to feel assured
A place where all you need to be is what you are-
A past that in the present somehow makes you feel secure
Well, I'm leavin' West Virginia in the morning
And I'm headin' out that California way
I don't know what I'll find but baby it's my time
And I'll surely leave my heart below the Mason-Dixon line
Yes I'll surely leave my heart below the Mason-Dixon line
",Leaving West Virginia
Kathy Mattea,"(Rodney Crowell)
I don't drink as much as I used to
Lately it just ain't my style
And the hard times don't hurt like they used to
They pass quicker like when I was a child
Somehow I learned how to listen
To a sound like the sun goin' down
In the magic that morning is bringin'
There's a song for the life I have found
It keeps my feet on the ground
The midsummer days ain't so heavy
They just flow like the breeze through your mind
And nothing appears in a hurry
To make up for some old lost time
Somehow I learned how to listen
To a sound like the sun goin' down
In the magic that morning is bringin'
There's a song for the life I have found
It keeps my feet on the ground
Somehow I learned how to listen
To a sound like the sun goin' down
In the magic that morning is bringin'
There's a song for the life I have found
It keeps my feet on the ground

Kathy Mattea,"Every time you come around
I hear that lonesome sound
Ooh, train of memories

Boxcars go flyin' by
With all my dreams inside
Ooh, train of memories

I see you wavin'
Hear you say goodbye
Rollin' down the tracks
Of the tears you made me cry
Ooh, train of memories

This locomotion runs on pain
So it's a never ending thing
Ooh, train of memories

Rumblin' through my mind
Pullin' the past behind
Ooh, train of memories

I see you wavin'
Hear you say goodbye
Rollin' down the tracks
Of the tears you made me cry
Ooh, train of memories

Ooh, here it comes again
Ooh, it's more than I can stand
No matter what I do
It brings me back to you

Kathy Mattea,"My father said some things you learn
Only by doing, when it comes your turn
Everything comes around, so be ready if you can
Prepare your heart like the farmer turns the land
You plant your fields
When the spring is tender
When the summer beats down
You pray for rain
You hope for the harvest
And the long cold winter
And then you plant your fields again
He spoke right to my restless soul
Still wild, and hungry, and beyond control
For all that you dream, there's a time and a place
But you won't know it till it comes your turn
You plant your fields
When the spring is tender
When the summer beats down
You pray for rain
You hope for the harvest
And the long cold winter
And then you plant your fields again",You Plant Your Fields

You're the only light that leads me home
Home is where the fire burns so warm and bright
'Long as I have you, I'll never roam
Our paths may wander on this walk of life
But I won't walk alone
Like a blaze of gold
At the break of dawn
You're the power that heals my soul
When the wind grows cold
And I'm halfway gone
You're the power that keeps me whole
Running like a river to the rolling sea
The waters of your love are deep and strong
My harbor and my shelter, you will always be
Even when the storm blows hard and long
While your spirit is a part of me
It gives life to this song",You're the Power

To the love we share
Through the good and the bad times too
I'll forsake my rest
For your happiness

To have and to hold you

For rich or for poor
Under skies grey or blue

There are wars and there are rumors
Of wars yet to come
Temptations we'll have to walk through
Though others may tremble
I will not run
'Til my death I will stand by you

I will put on the armor of faithfulness
To fight for a heart that is true
'Til the battle is won, I will not rest

Every love's the same
Every love has memories
Every love has pain

I knew love at nine

Is the sweetest love I'll ever find
Every town's familar
Every town is strange
When you're feeling lonely
Every town's the same

And I have dreamed of Rome
But the dream we're in right now
Is the sweetest dream I've ever known

In the silent
Shelter of the night
Hide me
Safely wrapped in your arms
Till morning light

Every love forgets

But I have no regrets

Love is made of gold

On my backdoor and up and down this alleyway
I think back on the times with your hand in mine
We sat talking low...late in the day
It seems you never know a good thing till it goes
Slippin' through your fingers...that's just the price I pay
For being on my own and doin' the best I can
Now I'm alone without a plan...late in the day
Now I pour whiskey, break the ice
Put my feet up and close my eyes
I try hard to listen to what my heart might say
Try to find the rhyme to take me back in time
And be with you here...late in the day
Now, I look out over tops of houses and the shops
As the sun sets, another day does wind down
And my life is still the same, my lips still call your name
And my heart can't hide the pain...late in the day

We control it no more than the flight of the sparrow

And though you may hide it, love knows how you feel 
And though you may trespass on the laws of the land 
Your heart has to follow when love takes your hand 

And it seems we're two people within the same circle 
It's drawn tighter and tighter till you're all that I see 
I'm full and I'm empty and you're pouring through me

And no one is in need. 

And there are no guns, no bombs, and no disease, 
No hungry mouths to feed. 
From a distance we are instruments 
Marching in a common band. 

Playing songs of hope, playing songs of peace. 
They're the songs of every man. 
God is watching us. God is watching us. 
God is watching us from a distance. 

From a distance you look like my friend, 
Even though we are at war. 
From a distance I just cannot comprehend 
What all this fighting is for. 
From a distance there is harmony, 
And it echoes through the land. 

And it's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves, 
It's the heart of every man. 
It's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves. 
This is the song of every man. 

And God is watching us, God is watching us, 
God is watching us from a distance. 
Oh, God is watching us, God is watching.

Kathy Mattea,"There was a motorcycle mama and her man
With a wind-burnt tan and a Harley
Roarin' through Bakersfield when her water broke
They pulled into a hospital and for a little joke

They named him Harley
They bought a sidecar
And a small bandanna band
And they loved their Harley

Slidin' sideways, up the coast
Cruisin' highway one
The sidecar came undone
No one noticed

Thrashing through a golden meadow
It came to rest right where
A farmer's wife cried
""Jesus Christ has answered all our prayers""

And they named him Harley
Because of a tattoo
That claimed his name was true
And they loved their Harley

He was raised upon a farm, cradled in the arms
Of Beulah and Barney
But then at a restless age they unlocked his cage
And he became a carny

There was a motorcycle daredevil deluxe
Jumping fifty trucks at the fairgrounds
A middle aged hippie couple way up in the stands
Heard the crowd chanting 'loud, the name of this young man

And they called him Harley
And that hippie couple smiled
Could this be their long lost child?
So they met Harley

Convinced him of the news
When they compared tattoos
And they loved their Harley",Harley

The clutter that fills up my rooms.
I can lock up and leave it, never retrieve it.
Leave nothing but my love for you. 

Let the storm winds blow.
I will not be cold.
I wear your love.
Thrown over my shoulders like a blanket of down.
I wear your love,
Like a bright suit of armor reflecting the sun.
On the chilliest night, though I travel light,
It is always enough, for I wear your love. 

You watched without knowing where I was going.
Trusting the vision I'd found.
For if dreams were a fire, I had desire,
That could burn this old house to the ground.  

So I walk quite free,
For surrounding me,
I wear your love.
Like a scarf that I borrowed that still holds your perfume.
I wear your love,
Pulled tight as I'm sleeping under a cold lovers's moon.
On the chilliest night, though I travel light,
It is always enough, for I wear your love. 

Don't you know? Can't you see?
Head to toe it is covering me.
Like a stone, the ocean's tide,
Nothing can hurt me or turn me aside.

Thrown over my shoulders like a blanket of down.

Kathy Mattea,"In the shade of this old tree,
In the summer of my dreams.
By the tall grass, by the wild rose,
Where the trees dance, as the wind blows:
As the days go, oh, so slowly,
As the sun shines, oh, so holy,
On the good and gracious green.
In the summer of my dreams. 

By the banks of this old stream,
In the summer of my dreams.
By the deep pool, where the fish wait,
For the old fool, with the wrong bait.
There's a field of purple clover;
There's a small cloud passing over.
And the rain comes washing clean,
On the summer of my dreams. 

See the raindrops on the grass now,
Just like diamonds lying there.
By the old road where I pass now,
There's a twilight in the air. 

And as the sun sets down before me,
I see my true love waiting for me,
Standing by the back porch screen,
In the summer of my dreams. 

In the shade of this old tree,
In the summer of my dreams.
By the tall grass, by the wild rose,

They roll down the river and slip out of sight

Put off 'til tomorrow what we'd really rather do tonight

And love while we're here before time passes by

Giving him a flutter and a sigh

But outside Amarillo, he found his thrill I tell you
Oh, I lost him to a jukebox and a pinball machine

If someone hadn't played the window of the bug
He'd still be mine today but he heard those fiddles play
One look and then I knew this must be love

Oh, that pinball machine was in the corner
Well, he saw the lights and he had to hear 'em ring
And he never was the same after he won his first big game

Your skin so soft, your eyes so blue.

They shine so high, so far away:
I die for you each passing day. 

It cannot be, it cannot be:
I cannot live in misery.
When will I hold you in my arms,
And lay by you beneath the stars?

Kathy Mattea,"I heard a voice last night in my sleep
I dreamed it was you callin' to me
It echoed sweet and low like every song I've known
Callin' me home

Swift as an arrow and true to it's mark
Right from your lips straight to my heart
Moves me like thunder, soothes me like rain
It's the sound of your voice callin' my name

Above all the noise and over the crowd
Softly your voice calls me out loud
No one else can hear but to me it sounds so clear
Drawin' me near

Swift as an arrow and true to it's mark
Right from your lips straight to my heart
Moves me like thunder, soothes me like rain
It's the sound of your voice callin' my name

Deep in my heart, down in my soul
Callin' me home like a whisper on the wind
You find me once again
And I can hear you callin'

Swift as an arrow and true to it's mark
Right from your lips straight to my heart
Moves me like thunder, soothes me like rain
It's the sound of your voice callin' my name

Kathy Mattea,"I need to go down and wash my face
Deep in the river of my old home place
I need to walk in the waters, that once gave me life
Go over and walk the old railroad tracks
See if I can follow it all the way back
Back to where my vision is clear
Back to the days of the innocent years

Though I'd trade it all back in
For just one day like it was back then
Back before just living my life got in the way
To see my face at sixteen again
When the boy down the street was my best friend
When his smile took away my tears
Back in the days of the innocent years

You might grow wiser every day
But there's a price you have to pay
The girl I was just disappeared
I left her behind in the innocent years

Now and then when the sun goes down
I can see the moon over my hometown
I can almost hear the train rushing by
I close my eyes and say a prayer
To the wide eyed girl that I lost somewhere
Maybe someday she'll find me here
And lead me back to the innocent years

You might grow wiser every day
But there's a price you have to pay
Girl I was just disappeared
Left her behind in the innocent years

When I get lost along the way
And I can't see the light of day
I can almost feel her near

A stroke held his wife fast asleep

The vigil he would daily keep
I asked would he rather be free ?

That's the vow that two hearts take
That if better turns to worse you will abide
That's the deal, if it were not for God's grace
I might be there in her place and she'd be right by my side

Kathy Mattea,"Well the night is as thick as silence
You can't cut it with a knife
A man lies in the hospital
Draining out his life
The trucks are on the back road
And in the dark the headlights shine
'Cause there's one man dead
On that Harlan County line

Oh anger, like poison
Is eating at your soul
Your thoughts are as loud as gunfire
Your face as hard as coal
Bitterness, like buckshot explodes inside your mind
And there's one man dead
On that Harlan County line

Oh a miner's life is fragile
It could shatter just like ice
But those who bear the struggle
Have always pay the price
There's blood upon the contact
Like vinegar in wine
And there's one man dead
On that Harlan County line

From the river bridge at Highsplint
To the Brookside railroad track
You can feel the long streak building 
That can never be turned back
The dead go forward with us
Not one is left behind
'Cause there's one man dead
On that Harlan County line

Where the night is as cold as iron
You can feel it in your bones
It settles like a shroud on the grave of Lawrence Jones
The graveyard shift is walking from the bathhouse into the mine
And there's one man dead
On that Harlan County line
One man dead 
On that Harlan County line
One miner dead 
On that Harlan County line",Lawrence Jones
Kathy Mattea,"[Chorus: ]
Oh can't you see that pretty little bird
Sing with all his heart and soul
He's got a blood red spot on his wing
And all the rest of him is black, as coal

Of all the colors I ever did see
Red and black are the ones I dread
For when a man spills blood on the coal
They carry him down form the coal mine, dead

Oh fly away you red winged bird
Leave behind the miner's wife
She'll dream about you when you're gone
She'll dream about you all her life

[Chorus: ]",Red-Winged Blackbird
Kathy Mattea,"In the deep dark hills of Eastern Kentucky
That's the place where I trace my bloodline
And it's there I read on a hillside gravestone
""You'll never leave Harlan alive""

Oh, my granddad's dad crossed the Cumberland Mountains
Where he took a pretty girl to be his bride
Said, ""Won't you walk with me out of the mouth of this holler
Or we'll never leave Harlan alive?""

[Chorus]
Where the sun comes up about ten in the mornin'
The sun goes down about three in the day
And you'll fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you're drinkin'
And you spend your life just thinkin' of how to get away

No one ever knew there was coal in them mountains
Till a man from the northeast arrived
He was waving hundred dollar bills said, ""I'll pay you for your minerals""
But he never left Harlan alive

Grandma sold out cheap and they moved out west of Pikeville
To a farm where big Richland river winds
Oh, I bet they danced them a jig and they laughed and sang a new song
""Who said we'd never leave Harlan alive""

But the times got hard and tobacco wasn't selling
And old granddad knew what he'd do to survive
So he went and dug Harlan coal, sent the money back to granny
But he never left Harlan alive

[Chorus]

Where the sun comes up aboud ten in the mornin'
The sun goes down about three in the day
And you'll fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you're drinkin'
And you spend your life diggin' coal from the bottom of your grave",You'll Never Leave Harlan Alive

I've questioned God enough

It's gonna be His time

Snow will fall but I'll recall your warmth
Summer wind breathing in your memory
I'll miss you

But I'll say goodbye for now

I can't imagine my life without you
You've held a place all your own
Just knowing you were beneath the same sky
Oh, what a joy I have known

On starry nights I'll glimpse the light of your smile
Never far from my heart you'll stay with me

""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings

Days of fun
Had many hours in the sun
Been to many mountains
Walked along the ocean shores

Counted stars on summer nights

That have filled my soul with joy

But, it's been the rain
I'ts been the storms
It's been the days
When I've been worn
That I have found You, Lord
That I have found You, Father
It's in the pain
That I have grown
Through all the sorrow
I have known
But, if that's what it takes
For You to lead me this far
Go ahead and break my heart

I have felt the winter snow
Seen the beauty of a rose
Sat by many fires
And enjoyed the warmth of friends
I've known love 
And it's embrace
Have felt the wind
Against my face
Watched the moon at midnight
Shine upon a sleeping world

Katie Armiger,"Sometimes I can be difficult
Hard to please, unpredictable, yeah
Sometimes I am a nervous wreck
A constant worrier, pain in the neck
But you just laugh and say it's typical me
And love me back to sanity

You love me through all my darkest days
It's just the way I've heard that love should be
I'm amazed at how you never change
It's like you only see the beautiful in me

When it feels like it's gonna rain
I roll the windows up and push you away
And when I'm sure that you're gonna leave
You stand there in the storm and you cover me
And all those clouds, they start to disappear
All because you were here

You love me through all my darkest days
It's just the way I've heard that love should be
I'm amazed at how you never change
It's like you only see the beautiful in me

When the world is a scary place
Not what you thought it would be
I wanna be here for you
Just like you've been for me, yeah

You love me through all my darkest days
It's just the way I've heard that love should be

Katie Armiger,"I guess the time was right for us to say
We'd take our time and live our lives
Together day by day
We'll make a wish and send it on a prayer
We know our dreams can all come true
With love that we can share

With you I never wonder
Will you be there for me
With you I never wonder
You're the right one for me

I finally found the love of a lifetime
A love to last my whole life through
I finally found the love of a lifetime
Forever in my heart
I finally found the love of a lifetime

With every kiss, our love is like brand new
And every star up in the sky
Was made for me and you
Still we both know that the road is long
We know that we will be together
Because our love is strong

I finally found the love of a lifetime

And suddenly there's nothing left for me to hide
I used to be so scared of this
And now you've gone and changed it all with just a kiss

I held back but you held on
Now we have everything we'll ever want

A love without fences, a love without walls
A love where we're taking and giving it all
A love without limits where we can be free
To follow our hearts wherever they lead
Baby, that's why we're here to love without fear

I lose myself in your touch
And finally I find that I am strong enough
To listen to this voice within
Telling me to throw all caution to the wind

My heart beats like thunder and I am not afraid
'Cause baby you showed me the way

Standing in clear view
I had so much to show
I was like an open book
You never even looked
So much I wanted you to know
The deepest part of me
You never tried to reach
It would have been so easy

All you had to do was pay some attention
All you had to do was look past the surface
But you never noticed much of anything
All you had to do was just try to listen
All you ever did was just catch a glimpse
And the tragedy is that you left so much unseen
You left so much unseen

You know my favorite color's blue
When I wear something new
And my favorite song
You didn't know my biggest fear
Was that you didn't care
That this ain't the life I want
To be right by your side
And have this great divide
We were close but so far

All you had to do was pay some attention
All you had to do was look past the surface
But you never noticed much of anything
All you had to do was just try to listen
All you ever did was just catch a glimpse
And the tragedy is that you left so much unseen

I didn't know how to deal with and so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself and never talk about it
And did not go and shout it when you walked into the room

I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of

I just need a place
I can call and name my own
My anywhere place, my anywhere place

Now that the trees are gone
And the waters cool
I'll go back where I can find what's true
Where it isn't gray
And where I can stay
And anywhere place

Tell me a story that consists of more
Then once upon a time
Starring that same same familiar friend

I just need a place

Katie Eagleson,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You
Katie Eagleson,"I wish I knew someone like you could love me
I wish I knew you place no one above me
Did I mistake this for a real romance?
I wish I knew, but only you can answer.

If you don't care, why let me hop[e and pray so
Don't lead me on, if I'm a fool just say so,
Should I keep dreaming on, or just forget you?
What shall I do, I wish I knew",I Wish I Knew
Katie Eagleson,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young
Katie Eagleson,"Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I intend to be independently blue
I want your love but I don't want to borrow
I have it today and give back tomorrow
For my love is your love but there's no love for nobody else",Love Me or Leave Me

Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon

Nice teacher, teach me something.

For when my chin is on the ground,

And pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,

Till the battle of the day is won.
You may be sick and tired,
But you'll be a man, my son!

Will you remember the famous men,
Who had to fall to rise again?
So take a deep breath,
Pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

I'll get some self assurance
If your endurance is great.
I'll learn by easy stages
If you're courageous and wait.

I must hang on to your hand,

How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last
With bits of memories scattered here and there
I look around and don't know where to start

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again

A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you",Where Do You Start

What our good God for us has done
In sending His beloved Son

There was a blessed Messiah born

Near Bethlehem did shepherds keep
Their flocks of lambs and feeding sheep
To whom God's angel did appear
Which put the shepherds in great fear
""Prepare and go,"" the angel said
""To Bethlehem, be not afraid
For there you'll find this happy morn
A princely babe, sweet Jesus born""

With thankful heart and joyful mind
The shepherds went the babe to find
And as God's angel hath foretold
They did our Savior Christ behold

And by His side the virgin maid
Attending on the Lord of Life

What's it like to be heard?

To hear that voice
What's it like to breathe?

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Can rust away and fall apart?

Katie Melua,"Broken people get recycled 
And I hope that I will. 
Sometimes we're thrown off our pathways 
What I thought was my way home 
Wasn't the place I know 
I'm certain nothing's certain 
What we own becomes our prison 
My possessions will be gone 
Back to where they came from 

Blame, no one is to blame 
As natural as the rain that falls 
Here comes the Flood again 

See the rock that you hold onto 
Is it gonna save you 
When the earth begins to crumble? 
Why do you feel you have to hold on? 
Imagine if you let go 

Blame, no one is to blame 
As natural as the rain that falls 
Here comes the Flood again 

Wash away the weight that pulls you down 
Ride the waves that free you from the dusk? 

Don't trust your eyes 
It's easy to believe them 
Know in your heart 
That you can leave your prison 

Don't trust your mind 
It's not always listening 
Turn on the lights 
And feel the ancient rhythm 

Don't trust your eyes 
It's easy to believe them 
Know in your heart 
That you can leave your prison

Marching home and no one’s touching
Army of the city workers
Secretaries, lawyers, brokers
Heading for a London station
Heading for a quick salvation
Oblivious to cherry cola
Trying to sell to every stranger

Stuck here it’s cold I’m standing
Hoping for some understanding
Only way to go is inside

Let my sense of time unravel
Trapped feelings are never ending
Send those weaknesses descending
Towards the earth’s red center
Let the fire rise and enter
Tap into the primal power
Rising like a giant tower

Cut a hole right through the ceiling

An elevator of light taking you somewhere

Puts me in zone of avoidance

Pulling like a super cluster

You really shouldn’t see
Why did you climb that last stair
You found me unaware

And I don’t want it to be known

Are insane, feed my brain

To lead us all to Wonderland

Remember, I'll always care
Wherever you may be
Remember I will be there""

She has a smile so bright and sweet
And hair as white as driven snow
Though life is never easy day to day
She has a very special way
To make us smile when we are low

We picked a flower and climbed the hill
Above the lake
And secret thoughts were said aloud
We watched the faces in the clouds
Until the clouds had blown away

Were we ever somewhere else
You know, it's hard to say

I never saw blue like that before
Across the sky, around the world
You've given me all you have and more
And no one else has ever shown me how
To see the world the way I see it now
Oh, I, I never saw blue like that

I can't believe a month ago
I was alone, I didn't know you
I hadn't seen you or heard you're name
And even now, I'm so amazed
It's like a dream, it's like a rainbow
It's like the rain

Somethings are the way they are
And words just can't explain

I never saw blue like that before
Across the sky, around the world
You've given me all you have and more
And no one else has ever shown me how
To see the world the way I see it now
Oh, I, I never saw blue like that before

And it feels like now
And it feels always
And it feels like coming home

I never saw blue like that before
Across the sky, around the world
You've given me all you have and more
And no one else has ever shown me how
To see the world the way I see it now

Que siga contento y nada más
Déjenlo que cante alegre
No quiero que tenga algún pesar

De fiesta en fiesta andará
Hermano será del carnaval
Con un grito bien salvaje
Que tiemble en los montes el supay

Que vea salir el sol
Maduro y caliente en el tunal
Y a los pájaros que trinan
Dan ganas de echar un achalay

Alegrate corazón
Esto te lo puedo asegurar
Mientras quede un santiagueño
La chacarera no morirá

Todo es fiesta para mí
Después de la lluvia contemplar
El color del horizonte
No sé qué pintor podrá pintar

La primavera traerá
La flor amarilla del chañar
Y el zumbar de las abejas
Que van trabajando su panal

Sombra del algarrobal
Comienza la tierra a florecer
Tata Dios ha de regarla
Cerquita ya del amanecer

Wie die Rolle es verlangt.
An das Theater haben sie ihr Herz verkauft
Sie stehn oben und die unten schaun sie an.

Himmel und Hölle zugleich.
Und der Clown
Der muß lachen
Auch wenn ihm zum weinen ist
Und das Publikum sieht nicht
Daß eine Träne fließt
Und der Held
Der muß stark sein
Und kämpfen für das Recht
Doch oft ist ihm vor Lampenfieber schlecht.
Alles ist nur Theater
Und ist doch auch Wirklichkeit

Und fing ein Gespräch an
Undsetzte sich ganz einfach her
Als wenn I'm Lokal rings umher

Nur hier bei mir
Am Finger die Stelle
Die war etwas heller
Wo er sonst den Ehering trug
Er hielt sich für unheimlich klug
Und hat geglaubt
Daß ich ihn nicht durchschau.

Und dir nicht zu traun ist
Ich mag dich - was ist dein Problem ?
Er wollt mir gefallen
Und war wie fast alle.
Nicht fähig für ein echtes Gefühl
Er trank und er trank viel
Zuviel
Und mit der Zeit tat er mir leid
Doch Mitleid und Liebe sind leider verschieden
Und irgendwann hab ich gesagt
Zuhaus sitzt die Frau
Die dich mag
Und gehst do zu ihr
Dann bring ihr Blumen mit.

Ohne Ziel und Sinn
Gehst do deinen Weg
Und do weißt nicht
Wo führt er hin.

Doch was morgen kommt
Liegt in deiner Hand
Denk' daran.
Und wenn ein neuer Tag erwacht
Aus den Träumen einer Nacht.
Fühlst do dich mit einem Mal wieder frei.
Und wenn einer neuer Tag erwacht
Und die Sonne wieder lacht
Ist die große Einsamkeit längst vorbei
Längst vorbei längst vorbei.
Hoffnungslos siehst do deine Welt
Und do fragst
Warum

Hoffnungslos solltest do nicht sein

Da bist do auch nicht mehr allein!

And you want her, and she wants you
We want everyone
And you want her and she wants you
No one, no one, no one ever is to blame

You can see the summit but you can't reach it
It's the last piece of the puzzle but you just can't make it fit
Doctor says you're cured but you still feel the pain
Aspirations in the clouds but your hopes go down the drain

And you want her, and she wants you
We want everyone
And you want her and she wants you
No one, no one, no one ever is to blame

No one ever is to blame
No one ever is to blame",No One Is to Blame
Katrina Elam,"Years go by, the singers change
Same old story but the words get rearranged
Somebody loves someone, somebody left someone
Somebody swears it wasn't supposed to end this way

[Chorus]
People dance to summertime
Happy songs with happy rhymes
The melodies make you want to drive and sing along
And singers talk about growing up
The first kiss and being in love
But nothing hits as close to home as the break up song
Violins and I love you
If the slightly miss their mark they ring untrue
But something 'bout goodbye making someone cry
Sounds to me more like what real people do

We need to talk, this ain't working out
Can we still be friends, I found someone else
I need some space, this just feels wrong

Katrina Elam,"Well, I hate to admit
When you dropped your hook I bit it
One look and you swept me away
When I dug a little deeper
It was obvious to see you're nothing more than just another pretty face
Beauty, only skin deep
That's all you think you need
So typical

[Chorus]
Nobody loves you like you do
You don't need me to make your dreams come true
You're your one and only so I'm leaving you to you
Get a live, get a clue, get a grip, get it through your head
Drop dead gorgeous
Well you really had me going
But your colors started showing
What I saw wasn't really my shade
Now the picture's getting clearer
Maybe if I was a mirror then you couldn't tear yourself away
Baby your looks could kill
Someday I hope they will
So pitiful

Katrina Elam,"Her mama cussed
She was out of film
As her baby came down those stairs
Lookin' right at him
His hands, they shook
As he pinned on that corsage
And she almost cried
'Cause she'd liked this guy
From the very start

Should've been just another first
Not the last
A beautiful moment in two lives
When they looked back

Now they're flowers by the side of the road
Yeah, that's all that's left
Of the hopes and dreams
Of two seventeen year olds
Some dreams live on
And some they don't
All that's left to know
All that's left to show
Are flowers by the side of the road

Coulda been me
Coulda been you
How many times have I said
I've just had one or two
It's a soberin' thought
It's a soberin' sight
Like a bad, bad dream
You can lose everything
One careless night

Be the one who lives
Be the one whose gone
Be the mother whose heart
Has to somehow go on

She'll be flowers by the side of the road
Yeah, that's all that's left

Blue water, white sand at her feet

In day out, predictable routine
That's why she stays home running away
To the place in her mind where he'll take her someday
When he gets the time, until then she's home

Dinner plans with her husband start at eight
But the dream ends with supper on the stove
The kitchen's about as far as she can go

Picture perfect like he'd stepped right off the silver screen
Said that he would sweep me off of my feet
I'm still standin', no, he didn't do it for me
'Cause I don't go for for all that wine and dine
With the Ray Ban, fake tan, half a mind

I want a down home, up-with-the-sunrise man
A pick-up truck driving, bull-riding, strong, steady hand
I want the Wrangler, Stetson and all that stuff
I want the real McCoy
I want a cowboy

I'm tired of talking ‘bout it, wasting my time
On all the cheap talkers – needing me, feeding me lines
Give me somebody who's tender but tough
Simple and honest, knows a thing or two about love
I've seen enough to know I know what I like
It's the hard working, head turning, rugged type

I want a down home, up-with-the-sunrise man
A pick-up truck driving, bull-riding, strong, steady hand
I want the Wrangler, Stetson and all that stuff
I want the real McCoy
I want a cowboy

I've seen enough to know, ya know what I mean

I won't draw it out
I won't stop to cry
He may be caught off guard
But he won't be surprised
This is where I usually let him

But I won't say goodbye

And what I can't resist
And how to make me second guess

I'm the pinks and you're the reds
Just like this sunset, we belong

With you is how I'm spending mine

And if you're still a virgin by the time that you're a junior
Then the rumor going 'round is you ain't right
Maybe I'm hard headed or a little bit old fashioned
But I always had a hard time fitting in
So when they rolled their eyes at me and told me I ain't normal
I always took it as a compliment

[Chorus]
Where I'm from normal is high school girls having kids
Marrying the boys that you grew up with
They say girl get your head on straight
You sit around and dream all day
That far away look in your eye ain't normal
Somebody's got to wear the roller skates down at the Sonic
But it never really fit into my plans
So when I up and moved 1000 miles from Oklahoma
Nobody in that town could understand

Where I'm from normal is doing what your mama did

But you're holding every breath I take
Feeling this is more than fate
So please don't let me go my baby

I try my best to get away from you so badly
Knowing that I'd give my heart to you so gladly
But then it came reality,
Every word of when she came to me
But now I gave myself to you
I'm so scared of what you're gonna do

And I know though we make our mistakes
But you're holding every breath I take
Feeling this is more than fate
So please don't let me go my baby

Katy B,"So sad that we have lost all our innocence
Something that was pure is now covered in red
Tainted by the role to become a woman
I thought that it'll cure
So why am I still walking towards you?
Right, left, my feet are full prepared
But how can I change direction
When you smile at me, I'm infected

Now should we lie to keep each other here
Or tell the truth and burn
Are you the man I thought you were
Or is there more to learn
And this would be unfair to tell you that
The whole of me is here
'Cause I woke up one day to find that I have disappeared
Oh-oh-oh, I have disappeared
Oh-oh-oh, I have disappeared
Oh-oh-oh, I have disappeared
Oh-oh-oh

The way that we would lie
I look into your eye
I wouldn't get a dime
Now I don't see the fire
Tainted by the role to become the man
You let me where you can
Like you didn't give a damn

It's mad
How something so real
Could be so conditional
But how can I change direction
When you smile at me, I'm infected

Now should we lie to keep each other here
Or tell the truth and burn
Am I the girl you thought I was
Or is there more to learn?
And this would be unfair to tell you that

Oh-oh-oh, I have disappeared
Oh-oh-oh, I have disappeared
Oh-oh-oh, I have disappeared
Oh-oh-oh

Now today we have then spoke and I'm still fine
But I'm scared about tomorrow
Where I must store in my sorrow
If it's not here to taste the pride
To live, to feel
Is it real?
Is it real?
Oh-oh-oh, I woke up one day to find that I was gone
Oh-oh-oh, where is the fun?
Oh-oh-oh, where did our hearts go?

Katy B,"Standing at the bar with my friend, Olivia
We were trying our best to catch up
That's when he walked over, said, ""I'd like to get to know you""
But all I could say was, ""Look, I'm sorry, love""

""You see I've had difficulties too many times before
And right now it's not really my thing""
He said, ""Just give me two minutes of your time
And tell me what you like me to be offering""

It's not that easy, it's not that easy
These days, can't find a man to please me
Their lines are far too cheesy
No boy is on the level, believe me

No boy is on the level, believe me
These days, can't find a man to please me
No boy is on the level, believe me
These days, can't find a man to please me

You don't have to have a lot of money
All you've got to have is fire burning deep in your soul
If you have a dream for something that you love
I'll support you, yeah, I'll play my role

Now I won't call you twenty times a day
'Cause I've got my own shit to do
When you see my name flashing on your phone
I want you to feel butterflies coming on through

It's not that easy, it's not that easy
These days, can't find a man to please me

No boy is on the level, believe me

No boy is on the level, believe me
These days, can't find a man to please me
No boy is on the level, believe me
These days, can't find a man to please me

Now one thing I can't stand is arrogance
There's no way that we would ever get along
But one thing I love is confidence
And humility to know when you've been wrong

Now I love a bad boy mentality
But I don't want to be visiting no jail
Just know if there's someone out there mocking me
Be my gangster when it's time to get real

It's not that easy, it's not that easy
These days, can't find a man to please me
Their lines are far too cheesy
No boy is on the level, believe me

No boy is on the level, believe me
And these days, can't find a man to please me, no
Oh, these days I can't find my, my easy please me",Easy Please Me

Then they surface in my dreams, they come alive
I sweep all my issues to somewhere I can't find
In hope that I'll forget but there's just so many times

Why can't I be strong and just confront all my fears?
When my fear is hurting you by being sincere
But how many more days can I run? How many years?
Emotions flooding and now it's all seeming so clear

Crying for no reason, feel the tears roll down
I felt strong but am I breaking now?
Crying for no reason 'cause I buried it deep
I made promises I could not keep
'Cause I never faced all the pain I caused
Now the pain is hitting me full force

I push all my problems to the back of my brain
A darkness deep inside where I just can't find my way
How can I walk with a smile? Get on with my day
When I deceived myself pretending it's all okay

I tried my best to hold it all together, I know
The strings have worn away and now I'm all exposed
I try to hide it all away on top of the shelf
I can lie to everyone but not to myself

Crying for no reason feel the tears roll down
I felt strong but am I breaking down?
Crying for no reason 'cause I buried it deep
I made promises I could not keep
'Cause I never faced all the pain I caused

'Cause there were things I couldn't say to you
Say to you
I'm breaking now

I burned some bridges down
There must be some way out
The voices speak so loud
Will you forgive me now?

I burned some bridges down
There must be some way out
The voices speak so loud
Will you forgive me now?

Crying for no reason, feel the tears roll down
I felt strong but am I breaking now?
Crying for no reason 'cause I buried it deep
I made promises I could not keep
But I never faced all the pain I caused
Now the pain is hitting me full force",Crying For No Reason
Katy B,"Standing outside your door
I had to come here
It’s never been like this before
You give me something
I’m addicted to the way
You got me lifted
All my senses pushed so high
My heart beats loud and strong
Thumping in my chest
Every second is a lifetime long
As I hear your footsteps
There’s no stopping this
I’m craving what you give
Your love that takes me to the sky

So come on fill me, with emotion
Come on fill me, with emotion
Come on, kiss me
And I’m floatin'
I wanna feel this, feel this emotion with you
I wanna feel this, feel this emotion with you

Warm when I see your face
You pull me closer
I say your love won’t ever go to waste
As I rest on your shoulder
I can’t comprehend
The way you pull me in the way
You never leave my mind
Have you really any idea
Of how you could hurt me
For you I make my soul clear
So don’t desert me
Grab me up in your love
When these times get tough
And say you’ll never leave my sight

So come on fill me, with emotion
Come on fill me, with emotion
Come on, kiss me
And I’m floatin'
I wanna feel this, feel this emotion with you
I wanna feel this, feel this emotion with you

Give me the feeling that I need
Let it wash over me
From my head down to my toes
You make me feel like I’m afloat
If I got you then I’m okay
I won’t hurt you, I won’t stray
So let me in and close the door
Nothing really matters anymore

Katy B,"You chose the simple life
My love was way too much for you to bear
And left our world to end right there
But I still hear you whispering my name
Surely there's a part unchanged
How could you be so far away
When I still see your face like it was only yesterday
And although you're out of sight
Would you still be the same if I was next to you tonight?

Still
Still on my mind now, still
You still know how to make me feel
How come these wounds won't heal
You're still on my mind now, still

Now how could I compete
With something bigger than the both of us
Why were we not good enough
We gave it all and watched it burn away
But the ashes still remain
I wonder what it is you say
When you close your eyes, what do you ask for when you pray
What do you need to sooth your soul
Why can't I find something else to make sense of it all

Still
Still on my mind now, still
You still know how to make me feel
How come these wounds won't heal
You're still on my mind now,

I can't let go, don't wanna let go
I can't let go, don't wanna let go

Still
Still on my mind now, still
You still know how to make me feel
How come these wounds won't heal?
You still have the power
Still, when we walked away
I thought we'd fade to gray
Thinking if you feel the same
If I don't want to heal
Why won't this heart beat still?
You're still on my mind now, still
You're still on my mind now, still",Still

Katy Garbi,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

I've been alone, and lonely, 
and I know the difference now. 
I know you can hold someone tight in your arms, 
and still be alone, somehow. 

I've been in love, and I've made love, 
and I know the difference now. 
I've touched and I've felt someone touch me inside, 
now that you've shown me how. 

I've watched the distance between us 
fading into the night. 
And I've felt love grow in the darkness 
til it was brighter than the morning light. 

I've had my share of lovers, 
but lovin's so different now. 
You touch me and suddenly I'm not alone, 
I feel like a lost child who's finally come home,

Katy Moffatt,"The lights of the town were just shutting down
The sun was fresh on the rise
I met momma at the door, she'd been walking the floor
She said, ""Boy, you've got stars in your eyes""

And momma, I was walking on the moon last night
And two loving arms held me tight
As the stars danced around so bright
I was walking on the moon last night

Now momma she did weep
""Boy you've been walking in your sleep
You can't keep your feet on the ground
It's not always what it seems
Young love may be a dream
And some angels fly high just to fall down""

And two loving arms held me tight
As the stars danced around so bright

Now the lights of the town are glowing yellow brown

I said, ""Don't worry any more
I've seen daddy put those same stars in your eyes""

I used to take comfort from long before I met you
And I caught a spark from her eyes of forgotten desire
With a word or a touch, lord, I could have rekindled that fire

No-one can light up the night like you do
Flickering embers of love - I've known one or two
But old flames can't hold a candle to you
Sometimes at night I think of old lovers I've known
I remember how holding them helped me not feeling so alone
Then I feel you beside me and even their memories are gone
Like stars in the night, lost in the sweet light of dawn
Old flames can't hold a candle to you

Caught in the eye of a hurricane
Slowly waving goodbye like a pageant parade
So sick of this town pulling me down
My mother says I should come back home but
Can't find the way cause the way is gone
So if I pray am I just sending words into outer space

I don't wanna lose your love tonight

They all split when I'm in trouble
But I'll tell you all my secrets if you stick around

Now that our love affair is over
You're exactly what I was looking for
We'll go find a shoulder to cry upon

Katy Perry,"Voted most likely to end up on the back OK a milk box drink
Looks like I'm letting them down
'Cause seven, seventy-five isn't worth and hour of my hard work and time
When you cant afford half the shit they advertise
Oh I'm worth more then they ask more then the two-tag generation full of regret
Oh I won't settle no, oh I can't settle

I wanna break the mold, I wanna break the stereotype
Fist in the air I'm not going down with out a fight
It's my life
And I'm sitting on the sidelines watching

It pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark
I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints on you

Representing you and me
Don't you wanna go down in history?
Rather then end up begging on the streets
Trading under table favors for a place to sleep
'Cause I'm worth more then this so stop writing prescriptions for my Ritalin
I can't focus my attention

I wanna break the mold, I wanna break the stereotype
Fist in the air I'm not going down with out a fight
It's my life
And I'm sitting on the sidelines watching

It pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy
I gotta make my mark
I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me

Don't give up
Don't give in
Because your arms on the rock
Oh I'm not innocent, innocent, innocent, innocent

Walk the allies in the dark
Sleep with candles burning
I leave the door unlocked
I'm weaving a rope and
Running all the red lights
Did I get your attention
'Cause I'm sending all the signs and
The clock is ticking
And I'll be giving my two weeks

Pick your favorite shade of black
You'd best prepare a speech
Say something funny
Say something sweet
But don't say that you loved me

'Cause I'm still breathing
But we've been dead for awhile
This sickness has no cure
We're goin' down for sure
Already lost a grip
Best abandon ship

Maybe I was too pale
Maybe I was too fat
Maybe you wanted better, better luck in the sack
No formal education
I swear way too much
I swear you didn't care
'Cause we were in love

So as I write this letter and shed my last tear
No, it's all for the better
That we end this here
Let's close this chapter
Say one last prayer
But don't say that you loved me

If you want me, it takes more than a wink,
And more than a drink and more than you think.
If you want me you're gonna' have to break the bank, tonight.
Cause some don't have the patience, some call me high-maintenance
But you pay the bill, cause, that's the deal.

If you wanna ride, just name your price don't play cheap, with your heart
Don't make a bet if you can't write the check, for me, for me.
Cause I can be bought, but you'll pay the cost

If you want me, I'm not a piece of ass, a one night stand, a storage ship
I think you better walk by, tonight
Oh, no.
If you want me, then stop begging I don't put out for charity
If you want me there's no discount price tonight
But I don't need your dollar bills I just want something real
Cause, nothings free, except a lovin' me

If you wanna ride, just name your price don't play cheap, with your heart
Don't make a bet if you can't write the check, for me, for me.

When you keep it all on mute
How will I know the right way to love you

Breaking down a man is no work out
But I have no clue
How to get through to you

I wanna hit you just to see if you cry
I keep knockin' on wood, hopin' there's a real boy inside

But you're not a man
You're just a Mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
But you're not a man

I wish I could just turn you on
Put a battery in and make you talk
Even pull a string for you to say anything

But with you there is no guarantee
Only expired warranty
A bunch of broken parts
And I can't seem to find your heart

I'm such a fool
I'm such a fool
I'm such a fool
This one's outta my hands
I can't put you back together again

Cause you're not a man

I wish you could feel that my love is real
But you're not a man
You're just a, a toy
Could you ever be a real, real boy
And understand
But you're not a man

If the past is the problem
Our future can solve them baby
I could bring you life if you let me inside baby
It'll hurt but in the end you'll be a man

Is kinda like a little sister

I just wanna be one of the girls

I started reading Seventeen
And shaving my legs
And I studied Lolita religiously
And I walked right in school
And caught you
Staring at me

What you know
But now your gonna' have to take a number
Its OK
Maybe one day
But not until I get my
Diamond ring

'Cause I don't want to be one of the boys

I just wanna be your homecoming queen

Baby you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you

That tells a story

An airplane riding a tidal
Wave on an ocean of emotion

Can't get off this ride

You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes

[Chorus: x2]

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really want to stay, no
(But you) But you don't really want to go-o

You're yes then you're no

Just wanna try you on

Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey

Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist so touchable
Too good to deny it

Katy Perry,"The weight of my words
Are like feathers from a bird
My mouth, it moves but you won't hear a thing
Cause I've dug myself deep 
I managed to fit both my hands and feet
All my little white lies
Smell like a big old bucket of bleach

In one ear
And out your other
So lock and key
You won't open up for me

So brick by brick
I am breaking through these walls
Oh between you and me
I'm not giving up
I'm not giving giving up

I guess 
And it feels like you're in China
And I am in Peru
When ever I am sleeping next to you
We can hear the crickets singing
Oh all throughout the night
OH boy can we just get used 
To something so right'

And sure I confess
I'm a mess
I'm a mess of mistakes
But please count to ten
Before you go and throw it all away 

So brick by brick
I am breaking through these walls
Oh between you and me
I'm not giving up
I'm not giving giving up
On on on us

Cause if you give up
Then what am I supposed to do
All these dreams 
Never will come true
Without you

Brick by brick 
I am breaking through these walls

Don't give up

Katy Perry,"I used to know you when we were young
You were in all my dreams
We sat together in period one
Fridays at 8:15
Now I see face in the strangest places
Movies and magazines
I saw you talkin' to Christopher Walken
On my TV screen

But I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you

I used to work in a record store
Now I work for my dad
Scraping the paint off of hard wood floors
The hours are pretty bad
Sometimes I wonder where you are
Probably in L.A.
That seems to be where everybody else ends up these days

But I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you

And I will wait for you

Katy Perry,"The fish swam
Out of the ocean
And grew legs
And they started walking
And the apes climbed down
From the trees
And grew tall
And they started talking

And the stars
Fell out of the sky
And my tears
Rolled into the ocean
Now I'm looking
For a reason why
You even set my world
Into motion

Cause if you're not
Really here
Then the stars
Don't even matter
Now I'm filled
To the top with fear
That it's all
Just a bunch of matter
Cause if you're not
Really here
Then I don't want
To be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold
Black and gold
Black and gold

I looked up
Into the grey sky
And see a thousand eyes
Staring back
And all around
These golden beacons
I see nothing but black

I feel the weight of something
Beyond them
I don't see
What I can feel
If vision
Is the only validation
Then most of my life
Isn't real

Cause if you're not
Really here
Then the stars
Don't even matter
Now I'm filled
To the top with fear
That it's all
Just a bunch of matter

People line up to receive.
She got the power in her hand
To shock you like you won't believe.
Saw her in the amazon
With the voltage running through her skin
Standing there with nothing on

I said ooh girl
Shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl
Turn me on with your electric feel

I said ooh girl
Shock me like an electric eel

Turn me on with your electric feel

Put your circuits in the sea

Making electricity

Oh you can do it all the time
Plug it in and change the world

Katy Perry,"I'm used to opening my own doors and splitting the checks
He introduced me, was always just a friend
I bought a new dress, he never noticed
Always falling for these bad boys, such a challenge
I'm getting tired, of cleaning up after them
I think I'm ready, to be a woman

Oh love, I think I'm ready
Ready for it

You were such a surprise
An unexpected gift
Said I was pretty, and I believed it
Not really used to all this attention
Told myself I don't deserve you
And this is just a phase
Could I get used to, being loved the right way?
I wanna argue, but there is nothing to say

Oh love, I think I'm ready
Ready for it
Ready for it
Oh love, I think I'm ready

Cause you send me flowers, when there's no occasion
Yeah we talk for hours, you still wanna listen
Won't hold it against me if I just need you to hold me tonight
My mother always told me that you'd show up one day
So scared to feel this way but love, I think I'm ready

Once you've had a taste of perfection
Like an apple hanging from a tree
I picked the ripest one
I still got the seed

You said move on
Where do I go
I guess second best
Is all I will know

Cause when I'm with him
I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one
Who was spending the night
Oh I wish that I
Was looking into your eyes

You're like an Indian summer
In the middle of winter
Like a hard candy
With a surprise center
How do I get better
Once I've had the best
You said there's
Tons of fish in the water
So the waters I will test

He kissed my lips
I taste your mouth
He pulled me in
I was disgusted with myself

Cause when I'm with him
I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one
Who was spending the night
Oh I wish that I
Was looking into your eyes

You're the best
And yes I do regret
How I could let myself
Let you go
Now the lesson's learned
I touched it I was burned
Oh I think you should know

Cause when I'm with him
I am thinking of you
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one
Who was spending the night
Oh I wish that I
Was looking into your eyes

Looking into your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Oh won't you walk through
And bust in the door
And take me away
Oh no more mistakes
Cause in your eyes I'd like to stay",Thinking of You [Live Acoustic Version][Live]

Katy Perry,"This is the last time you say
After the last line you break
It's not even a holiday
Nothing to celebrate

You give a hundred reasons why
And you say you're really gonna try
If I had a nickel for every time
I'd own the bank

Thought that I was the exception
I could reroute your addiction
You could've been the greatest
But you'd rather get wasted

You fall asleep during foreplay
Cause the pills you take are more your forte
I'm not sticking around to watch you go down
Wanna be your lover, not your fucking mother
Can't be your savior; I don't have the power
I'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain

You say you have to write your rhymes
Whatever helps you sleep at night
You've become what you despise
A stereotype

You think you're so rock and roll
But you're really just a joke
Had the world in the palm of your hands
But you fucking choked

Should've been my team mate
Could've changed your fate
You say that you love me
You won't remember in the morning

You fall asleep during foreplay
Cause the pills you take are more your forte
I'm not sticking around to watch you go down
Wanna be your lover, not your fucking mother
Can't be your savior; I don't have the power
I'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain

I'm not sticking around to watch you go down
Wanna be your lover, not your fucking mother
Can't be your savior; I don't have the power

Could you be the devil, could you be an angel

Feels like I'm floating, leaves my body glowing

You're not like the others, futuristic lovers
Different DNA, they don't understand you

You're from a whole other world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

Kiss me, k-k-kiss me
Infect me with your love and fill me with your poison
Take me, t-t-take me
Wanna be a victim, ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign
Its supernatural, extraterrestrial

You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers, stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic, every move is magic

You're from a whole other world

And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

Boy, you're my lucky star
I wanna walk on your wave length
And be there when you vibrate
For you I risk it all, all

Kiss me, k-k-kiss me
Infect me with your love and fill me with your poison

Six feet under screams
But no one seems to hear a thing

Do you know that there's still a chance for you

You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow

Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

She used to set the sails of a thousand ships
Was a force to be reckoned with

I can feel a phoenix inside of me,
As I march alone to a different beat,
Slowly slowing down my fear,
Yeah, yeah

I am ready for the road less traveled,
Suiting up for my crowning battle,
This test is my own cross to bare,
But I will get there

It's never easy to be chosen,
Never easy to be called,
Standing on the front line when the bombs start to fall,
I can see the Heavens,
But I still hear the flames calling out my name

I can see the writing on the wall,
I can't ignore this war,
At the end of it all,
Who am I living for?

I can feel this light that's inside of me,
Growing fast into a bolt of lightning,
I know one spark will shock the world,
Yeah, yeah

So I pray for favor like Esther,
I need Your strength to handle the pressure,
I know there will be sacrifice,
But that's the price

Katy Perry,"Summer after high school, when we first met
We make-out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos

Used to steal your parents liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you

In another life, I would be your girl
We keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

I was June and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa

Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

In another life, I would be your girl
We keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

The one, the one, the one
The one that got away

All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should'a told you what you meant to me, whoa
Cause now I pay the price

In another life, I would be your girl
We keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay

Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacktop blur
But I'm pretty sure it ruled
Last Friday night
Yeah we danced on table tops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a menage a trois

Infect me with your lovin

Drifting through the wind

Already buried deep
Six feet under screams
But no one seems to hear a thing

Cause there's a spark in you
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine

Choose your battles, babe

A life of lux, I swallowed up the keys
I was petrified, only knew how to hide

So camouflage was my own worst enemy

Dancing on a wire

I'm disheartened

Do I start over, rediscover?
Submit to the sweet surrender

It's a mind maze
All these head games
Caught in a cage
A complex cage
Am I a car on fire?
Will I be devoured?
I gotta free myself and get out of my own way

I used to be so sparkling, but now it's not so charming
What used to stimulate me now can barely wake me
I'm unresponsive
Will I find salvation, some kind of moderation?
Spinning all these plates is gonna be a challenge

Lady Grey, when I see you now
Sick in your bed, but still you smile
When you hear the music play
Wonder how it would be if you could

Take me, take me away
Way back to the days when you were
Crazy, crazy for living
Oh, sweet twenty-nine
And you looked fine

Move around like a king without a crown
System breakdown
With a chum doing long nights on the town
No happy ending is near
So it's time to face the fear
It's time to move, move along
And make music on my own

I like to walk, walk ahead
And eat up my dirty shred
I wish the strings that are played were connected with a thread

Du kan ikke sitte å sutre hvis du bare sier nei

Du trenger enkel symbolikk
Og lite tilbakemelding på at skal hjula begynne å gå

Dreaming of his heroes and in love with a girl
But on a thunderous night along a ragged coast
A mysterious red car came to him
Its power lighting his eyes blood-red

Kay Adams,"Big Mack was a driver of a semi rig from Denver to the coast of Maine
And every truck driver and highwayman well they all knew big Mack's name
He stepped into a diner by the scales where he stopped to weigh
He looked at me I'm the waitress there and we all heard him say
Pour me a piece of coffee pass me a cup of bread
Why you're the sweetest things that I've ever seen and there's a ringin' in my head
Make my eggs a medium rare over easy now with my steak
I'm gonna buy you a farm in Texas gal if it takes everything I make

Well I stood there a starin' at Big Mack kind of in a state of shock
I told him when she set his orange juice down be careful Mack it's kinda hot
I've already buttered your coffee the toast is in your cup
Your french fried soup and scrambled prunes will soon be coming up
Well I took her apron off grabbed her coat down off the rack
Took Big Mack's arm and told my boss I'm a quittin' and I won't be back
I climbed up in my diesel both pipes were a spoutin' smoke
I heard someone say Big Mack just fell and this time it ain't no joke
Yeah pour me a piece of coffee
I'm gonna buy you a farm in Texas if it takes every doggone thing I make",Big Mack
Kay Adams,"I'll play second fiddle to your new love while it lasts
Just like all the others I played for in the past
Why can't I be a leader and play a leading part
Why must I always have to play second fiddle in your heart
So play fiddle play will there never come a day
When I won't have to play the part of second fiddle in your heart

Each time you find a new love you leave me here to cry
The teardrops tell a story of a love that just won't die
Like an early mornin' paper the news you get just part
Why must I always have to play second fiddle in your heart
So play fiddle play",Second Fiddle
Kay Adams,"Promises promises that's all I ever get
You said you'd quit that trucking but you ain't quit it yet
Each time you come dragging in you say I'll have my way
You'll find a joke right here at home but that'll be the day

A little Danny boy was born in Amarrillo while you was somewhere on the road
You said you were snowbind in Idaho haulin' some heavy load
And when you lost that rig and done her pass honey you said you'd quit that day
You swore that run would be your last but ha that'll be the day
Promises promises...

You know Judy's gonna marry the boy next door the one that you've never even met
You told me that you'd get the drive away but well I know that you'll forget
And when they ask me where you are each night I don't know what to say
We're lonesome and wantin' you home with us but that'll be the day

Only God knows what I'm going through walk the floor and worry over you
Haven't slept a wink since you've been gone don't know how I'll stand this very long
Only God knows what I'm going through walk the floor and worry over you

Maybe someday you'll return to me then things will be the way they used to be
Only you can make my dreams come true walk the floor and worry over you
Haven't slept a wink",Walk the Floor
Kay Adams,"I'm with my little girl the only friend left in the world
So I gave her a book to color on
Just to pass the time away this had been her longest day
Everything is lonely with him gone
I laughed when I first looked at the pictures in her book
The way she colored everything all wrong
But this chill came over me as I realized that she
Had colored things as she felt baby long
She colored mommy blue with brown eyes crying
She made our house as grey as the dawn
She made the sun as black as night as if to say it had no light
But she didn't color daddy cause he's gone
Oh yes I'm so blue and I've been crying and our home is as grey as the dawn
And the sun it gives no light every day is black as night
And she didn't color daddy cause he's gone
Oh no she didn't color daddy cause he's gone",She Didn't Color Daddy
Kay Adams,"You've got me trapped by two lips that keep begging me to stay
Trapped by two arms that won't let me walk away
You don't love me but you don't want me to go
You've got me trapped with a hopeless love I know

I keep saying that I'm gonna leave someday that you're not gonna hurt me anymore
But I'd be back before my footsteps fade away
And I'd be under your spell just like before
You've got me trapped

And so foolishly I keep hanging on to you
Even though I know you hurt me just once more
But what the use to go I couldn't stay I'd be back to you before you close the door
You've got me trapped",Trapped
Kay Cee,"When the routine bites hard 
And ambitions are low
And the resentment rides high
But emotions won't grow
And we're changing our ways
Taking different roads
Then love, love will tear us apart again

Why is the bedroom so cold?
Turned away on your side
Is my timing that flawed?
Our respect run so dry

Wet, there's still this appeal
That we've kept through our lives
Love, love will tear us apart again

Do you cry out in your sleep?
All my failings exposed
Get a taste in my mouth
As desperation takes hold

Is it something so good
Just can't function no more?
When love, love will tear us apart again",Love Will Tear Us Apart
Kay Hanley,"I got up early on Monday 
And it suited me fine 
That the leaves had started 
Turning and it was cold outside 
Because the sun surely shined 
The autumn ought to come 
You used to say you liked it 
Well I still like it 
I never got your message 
I didn't think 
That you cared anymore 
Now that you're out in Los Angeles 
You kind of closed that door 
But soon I'll need some warm air 
I'm coming out in November 
Will you be there? 
Will you be there? 
In the fall 
Tell me could the reddest tree 
Definitely give you something 
To figure out? 
Or is that impossible now? 
I wore that red fuzzy sweater 
Through the frosty grass today 
And it made me feel so safe and warm
Like cherry marmalade 
So it looks like I might 
Plant myself where I am 
And just travel light 
It looks like I might 
Fall",Fall
Kay Hanley,"Walk out the door 
Turn around 
Pick up the phone 
Put it down 

Your voice gets so disappointed 
And I don't want to hear that sound 
Said the queen bee 
Get thee back 

And trampoline me to the right track 
I said I'm sorry 
And I can't say it any better than that 
Every moment gets replayed 

And recreated in my head 
I go back to all the perfect things 
I wish I would have said 
I'd be made in the shade 

Fantastical sweet surprise 
Maniacal was my demise 
It left me standing 
With a solar landing in my eyes 

Said the queen bee 
Everything's wrong 
So go ahead 
And get along 

But first do your worst 
I got my best happy ending face on 
Every moment gets replayed...

What I've been meaning to say 
Is we've got to call our own armistice day 
And if it's all a circle 
Everything to me's a circle 

I'll just cover my eyes 
And when I cover my eyes 
I miss the parade

Take it back 
Every moment gets replayed...",Made in the Shade

And all the fellows knew,
She wouldn't bill and coo:
Ev'ry single night some smart fellow would try 
o cuddle up to her, but she would cry:
 
""Ma, he's making eyes at me!
Ma he's awful nice to me!
Ma he's almost breaking my heart,
I'm beside him, Mercy!
Let his conscience guide him!
Ma, he wants to marry me,
Be my honey bee.
Ev'ry minute he gets bolder,
Now he's leaning on my shoulder,
Ma, he's kissing me!""
 
Lilly was so good, ev'ry body could tell.
You'd never see her roam,
She'd always stay at home;
All the neighbors knew little Lilly too well.
For when the boys would call, They'd hear her yell:
 
Ma, he's making eyes at me!
Ma he's awful nice to me!
Ma he's almost breaking my heart,
If you peek in, Can't you see I'm goin' to weaken?
Ma, he wants to marry me,
Be my honey bee.
Ma, I'm meeting with resistance, 
I shall holler for assistance,
Ma, he's kissing me!""

- words and music by Saxie Dowell
Down in the meadow in a little bitty pool
Swam three little fishies and a mama fishie too
""Swim"" said the mama fishie, ""Swim if you can""
And they swam and they swam all over the dam
Boop boop dit-tem dat-tem what-tem Chu!
Boop boop dit-tem dat-tem what-tem Chu!
Boop boop dit-tem dat-tem what-tem Chu!
And they swam and they swam all over the dam
""Stop"" said the mama fishie, ""or you will get lost""
The three little fishies didn't want to be bossed
The three little fishies went off on a spree
And they swam and they swam right out to the sea
Boop boop dit-tem dat-tem what-tem Chu!
Boop boop dit-tem dat-tem what-tem Chu!
Boop boop dit-tem dat-tem what-tem Chu!
And they swam and they swam right out to the sea
""Whee!"" yelled the little fishies, ""Here's a lot of fun
We'll swim in the sea till the day is done""

Deine Futt ist wie ein Schlagring, 4 Finger passen rein
Ey, ich will die Fotze deiner Hurenschwester
Und habe die Griffe drauf wie ein Judokämpfer
Du bist Gangster, kommst raus, willst dich wichsen
Doch ich ficke dich mit einer Faust wie beim Fisten
Ich komme mit Kay One, eowa, wer ist Jay Khan
10 Stunden lang ficken ist, was ich auf Jay kann
Nachdem ich den Bastard KO schlag
Ist der Fisch in der Zeitung wie 'ne Mafia-Botschaft
Klatsch ihn in Ohnmacht, dann wacht er wieder auf
Sieht die Zähne auf dem Tisch und sagt, hatt ich die nicht im Maul?

Blonde Haare, knappes T-Shirt
Ihre Haut goldbraun, ja, ich steh auf

Alles edel, ihre Nägel
Orgasmus, wenn sie ei'm die Hand gibt
Augen wie Bambi, Candy Parfum
Yves Saint Laurent
Ihre Art, wie sie redet
Du merkst, ihr Daddy hat Knete

Heut' ist es mir egal was auch immer du machst
Klar tut's weh mit anzusehen wie du dein Ding machst
Letztes Jahr noch überlegt welcher Ring passt
Letztes Jahr noch im Urlaub
Und ich vermiss' es  was interessieren mich die Bitches
All dieser Luxus scheiß auf Champagner,
Scheiß' auf die Partys, dass Geld ich war dankbar,
Dass ich dich traf das war Schicksal auf der Miss Wahl
Als ich dich sah und ich dachte echt das mit uns passt
Wir sind Erwachsen also 'nen mir den Grund Schatz,
Deine Augen haben gelogen du bist schön doch vergleichbar mit Rosen
Niemals anfassen es könnte weh tun
Ich hab ein Herz aus Stein doch ich geb's zu.

Schatz ich wünscht' du könntest dich durch meine Augen sehn'
Wie du's geniest zu wissen dass die Jungs so auf dich stehn'
Du wolltest frei sein und so wurd' ich eingetauscht
Du bist Schuld daran dass ich nich' mehr vertrau'

Ich hass' es dich zu lieben
Außer diesem Schmerz ist mir nichts geblieben
Wir waren zu verschieden Streitereien und irgendwie
Genieß' diese Einsamkeit, ich höre oft
Man hat dich hier und dort gesehen mit ihm gesehen
Du konntest nicht Wiederstehen
Auf dem Tisch rumgeknutscht warst nicht zu retten
Dom Pérignon Schlacht mit Servietten
Drei vier Typen Kontakt ausgetauscht eine Frage
Sag wie krass bist du drauf?
Ich erkenn' dich nicht mehr das bist du nicht
Erzähl mir nicht dass du glücklich bist erzähl mir nicht
Dass es sich gelohnt hat, lüg' nich'
Wer macht dir jetzt Frühstück
Wer ist jetzt da wenn du krank bist
Wenn's dir schlecht geht
Du bist weg und es tut echt weh, ich hasse dich.

Mach deine Schule fertig, gib mir das Gras
Gib mir die Playsi, ja, bla bla
Mann, ich war damals gern erst um 8 Uhr da
Deshalb gab's für mich keine Abschlussfahrt
Egal, was war, ich bekam
Immer die Schuld, die Geduld war nicht mehr da
Jeden Mittag saß ich meine Strafe ab für nichts
Was, Frau Meier, warte ab, du Bitch
Kenneth, wieder kam da ein Brief
Hör, du bist gar nicht beliebt
Voll unsympathischer Typ und so hart zu erzieh'n
Viele Lehrer sind stark depressiv
Du musst geh'n, also verließ
Ich meine Schule, fickt euch, Peace
Viel Glück euch Freaks, ich komm nie wieder zurück
Doch hab ich irgendwann Erfolg, dann trifft's euch tief
Ich hab ein Plan, ja, ich werd einfach Rapper ist klar
Ihr wisst jede Scheiße besser
Irgendwann ausschlafen, keine Wecker
Und ohne Grund in meinen Scheinen blättern
Und dann in 'nem Maybach wegfahr'n
Währenddessen fahren Neider S-Bahn
Ich dreh mich um und seh die Vollidioten grade weiterlästern

Ich werde es schaffen,
Und ja, sie könn' lachen und denken, es wird niemals klappen
Dann komm ich im schwarz-matten Lambo vor ihre Tür

Kay One,"Hey ich bin's
Ich weiß nicht ob deine Nummer noch aktuell is' umm
Ich wollt mich bei dir melden und dir sagen
Dass es mir gut geht und
Ich hier halt glücklich bin und umm
Drum schick ich auch meine Nummer nicht auch nicht mit
Ich glaub es is'besser so
Aber tu mir bitte ein Gefallen und pass auf dich auf
Bis dann tchau

Ich denk an uns und schreib diesen Text jetzt
Ich vermiss dich immernoch und es stresst echt
Mein Pech wächst seit dem Tag
Als du mich verlassen hast, komm allein nicht klar, immer
Partys hier, Partys da, du bist gegangen
My first love, ja, ich hatt' kein Geld
Ich hatt' kein Fame, damals hieß ich noch Kenneth
Es gab kein Kay doch du hast mich geliebt
Geliebt wie ich bin, vielleicht war ich ein Arsch
Doch Liebe macht blind, aber du warst da, mein Superstar
Ich hatt' kein Problem mit dem Zug zu fahren
Egal wo du warst, ich bin gekomm'n
In der Zeit kannt' ich kein Dom Perignon
Ich war broke und ich konnt dich nirgends einladen
Aber trotzdem sprachen wir vom Heiraten
Lass mich dir eins sagen
Ich vermiss diese Zeit
Wär so gern wieder glücklich vereint, aber nein

Dieses Leben ist kein Wunschkonzert
Ich hab ein' wunden Punkt im Herz

(My first love) Ich will die Zeit zurückdrehn'
Und mit dir ein kleines Stück gehn'
(My first love) Noch einmal nach Paris
Kein Geld, doch wir warn' verliebt
(My first love) Schatz, ich sag Dankeschön
Für die Zeit, es tut mir Leid
(My first love) Wo du auch bist und was du grad tust
Ich hoff' dir geht's gut
(My first love)

Bis jetzt hat's noch keine geschafft
Mein Herz zu bekommen, ich vergleich dich, mein Schatz
Mit jeder Frau die ich kennenlern' und es nervt echt
Keine hier ist perfekt
Manche sind sehr nett, hey und manche nur hübsch
In manchen steckt auch 'ne Bitch
Es ist wie es ist, es kommt wie es kommt, Schicksal
Als die Quittung kam war klar, ich zahl
Ich sah bei uns Zukunft, doch vielleicht waren wir zu jung
„geh mit ihr gut um!“, drohte dein Daddy
Ich hatt' kein Geld doch kaufte dein Blackberry
Denn mir war's egal, ich hab dich geliebt
Und ohne dich leben, macht depressiv
In der Nacht so aktiv, du raubst mein Schlaf, kein Scheiß
Und da hilft kein Geld, da hilft kein Hype
Denn wahre Liebe kannst du nicht kaufen
Die eine unter 100.000

Dieses Leben ist kein Wunschkonzert
Ich hab ein' wunden Punkt im Herz

(My first love) Ich will die Zeit zurückdrehn'
Und mit dir ein kleines Stück gehn'
(My first love) Noch einmal nach Paris
Kein Geld, doch wir warn' verliebt

Kay One,"Es war 'ne Wahnsinnsnacht, ich erinner mich
Hab dir gezeigt, was ein Candlelight-Dinner ist
Wir tranken Weißwein und schon allein dein
Sommerkleid bleibt mein Highlight, ich lieb dein Style
Dein Outfit war heiß, ich mag dein
Auftreten, du könntest echt ein Star sein
So viel gelacht und diskutiert
Danach hab ich gesagt, woll'n wir nicht zu mir?
Ich könnt dich massier'n, dich studier'n
Ich hab noch ein Geschenk und es ist kariert
Doch es liegt bei mir, jetzt liegt's an dir
Ob wir bald losgeh'n, es wird nichts passier'n
Außer Kuscheln, und du grinst selbst
Wir müssen los, Baby, es wird um 5 hell
Und was in Stuttgart passiert, bleibt auch in Stuttgart
Psch, ich seh doch, dass du Lust hast

Es ist okay
Du musst dich nicht schäm'n

Es war doch nur ein One Night Stand
Auch wenn wir uns nicht richtig kenn'
Nehm ich, dich ins Bett
Ich wusst von Anfang an
Das war ein One Night Stand

Ich wurd' schnell wach und du lagst da
Immer noch halbnackt, Schatz, es war klar
Wir hatten so guten Sex, ich lieb es so
Wenn sich 'ne Frau fallen lässt, zügellos
Meine Kratzer am Rücken, am Hals die Bissspur'n
Und dein Haar duftete nach Gliss-Kur
Leidenschaftlich gezeigt, was 'ne heiße Nacht ist
Und nein, es war nicht meine Absicht
Ich wollt dir nicht wehtun, du hast noch geschlafen
Ich bin gegang'n, ohne etwas zu sagen
Keine Nummer, kein Zettel, hart, ich weiß
Das war nicht nice
Das war nicht cool und ich bin auch nicht stolz drauf
Ich schieb's bestimmt nicht auf den Vollrausch
Aber das mit uns zweien würde niemals gut geh'n
Verdammt, ich geb's zu, ich wollte dir nicht weh tun

Ich würd echt alles tun, dass du wieder hier bist,

Sogar meine aller erste Freundin,
Meine Eltern, Brüder, Onkels, die Tanten,
Und keiner hat's verstanden,

Doch mir geht's gut, hier bin ich geborgen,
Ihr müsst jetzt wieder leben, ich möchte dass ihr lacht,
Und keine Angst, ich bin da, ich seh was ihr macht,

Lieber Gott,
Als aller erstes wollt ich dir mal Danke sagen.
Du hast meinen weg geebnet in diesen ganzen Jahren.
Ich hab viel Mist gebaut und jetz hab ich die Angst,
Es steht auf meinem Arm dass nur du mich richten kannst,
Es war dein Wille, dass ich ein ganz großer werd,
Doch momentan bin ich dumm ich muss noch soviel lernen
Ich bin auf Party hier, ich bin auf Partys da
Mach krumme Dinge weil ich grad auf mein Ferarri spar
Und ich genieß' mein Leben und zwar in vollen Zügen
Sitz im Privatjet, ich fahre nicht in vollen Zügen.
Verschleuder mein Erspartes in den Automaten.
Wir bleiben arm und die andern hab Haus und Garten
Heute König, morgen Penner.
Scheiß drauf wir hatten Spaß
Und deswegen leb ich weiter in den Tag, aber wenigstens
Kann ich mein Kindern was erzählen ich habs gesehen.

Damit Bushido auf der Bühne vor 10.000 Fans,
Ich hatte dich hübschesten Frauen,
Viele waren Prominent,
Ihr kennt die Namen selber, wen hab ich schon alles gebangt?
Hand aufs Herz, ich bereu' nichts,
Ich halte ewig diesen Kurs,
Versuch zu lachen, dieses Leben is zu kurz.
Wenn du Traurig bist und sterben willst
Denk an die Leute die so traurig sind weil Sie sterben müssen.
Inzwischen Lach ich wieder.
Ich komme wieder klar,
Alles wunderbar, mir scheint die Sonne aus dem Arsch.
Ein wundervoller Tag,
Ja heute Lad ich alle meine Freunde ein,
Und schenke jedem Straßenpenner heute teuren Wein.
Ich lebe jeden Tag als wär's mein letzter
Jeden Tag Geburtstag, Weihnachten, Silvester
Aber wenigstens kann ich mein Kindern was erzählen,

Denn dieses Leben es ist viel zu kurz und Kostbar,
Ich hab schon immer gern getan was falsch war
Vielleicht lag es an meiner Reife und dem Alter

Kay One,"Ich sprech' einen Trost aus
Auf mich und meine Hits und auf all mein Geld
Warum mich alle lieben? Ich bin halt ich selbst
Ein Playboy ein Badboy so unerreicht
Ich untertreib wenn ich sag ich bin die Nummer 1
Ich trink auf meinen Erfolg und auf all mein Geld
Warum mich alle lieben? Ich bin halt ich selbst
Ein Playboy ein Badboy so unerreicht
Champus auf Eis dazu Hummerfleisch

Ich erinner mich an damals an die ersten Rhymes
Die ersten Lines
Verdammt, das war die schwerste Zeit
Kein Deal, mein Ziel wars berühmt zu sein
Sechs Liter Veuve Clicquot, und ich gieß' ihn ein
Ich zünd' die Kippe an und erzähle euch jetzt
Wie das damals war mit dem Deutschrap
Ich hatte keine, keine Perspektiven
Aufstehen? Nein! Ich bleibe lieber liegen
Die Lehrer waren mit mir keineswegs zufrieden
Der Coole von der Schule, die Weiber, die mich liebten
Ich wollte freestylen, Text schreiben keine Lust
Ich fuhr wie B-Rabbit rum, ganz allein im Bus
12:30 Schluss, ich schwänz den Nachmittagsunterricht
Jugendhaus, paar Rapper unter sich
Keiner konnte damals ahnen was aus Kenneth wird
Ein Star, der sich in die Menge stürzt

Ich komm aus Ravensburg, 'ner Kleinstadt im Süden
Und dachte schon als Kind, es wird Zeit dass die Typen
Aus den Großstädten sehen was die Provinzler so können
Doch sie wollten es dem Prinz noch nicht gönnen
Tapes abgegeben, CDs abgegeben
Heute lass' ich es aus der Moët Flasche regnen
Es war ein steinharter Weg nach oben
Wie oft lag ich auf dem Boden
Ja ich sage danke meiner Mutter, meinem Vater
Meinen beiden Brüdern, der ganzen Abou Chakers
Ari und Bushido ich trage euch im Herzen
Es wurde wahr dieses Märchen
Heute steh ich hier, stoße auf mich an
Und wenn du willst, signier' ich dir das Poster an der Wand
Das hier geht an alle Leute, die nie an mich geglaubt haben
Was ich jetzt verdiene könnt ihr euch ja ausmalen

Mich wieder zu verlieben, doch es geht nicht mehr
Wie gern hätte ich wieder dieses Glücksgefühl
Häng ab mit den Bitches, doch es bringt nicht viel
Ich red mir ein, es geht vorbei
Ich entschuldige mich hier für mein Herz aus Stein
Ich wollt das hier alles nicht und ich bin's Leid
Sie geht nicht vorbei, sie geht nicht vorbei, die Zeit

Du regst dich auf, dass ich ein Playboy bin, doch ich versteh's
Verdammt mein Herz wurde gebrochen von ner Bitch,
Erzähl mir nix von Liebe und glücklich zusammen sein
Ich saufe den Moët auf Ex und fick' die Vergangenheit
Shoppen geh'n in München, Handtasche von MS
Und wenn ich mal kein Geld hatte, war ich ihr zu schlecht
Hab' ihr jeden Wunsch erfüllt, doch was bekam ich? Nichts
Außer Streitereien und Rumgeschreie, dismissed
Ich wurde ersetzt, kein Problem, und der Respekt ist seit diesem Tag
Weg, seitdem die Liebe, krass Pech
Scheiß auf die Ex, ich musste mich jetzt ablenken
Von dem Tag an zählt Kay One zu den Nachtmenschen
Jeden Tag nur Partys, Frauen die dein Geld wollen
Models, die bei Koks den 500er so schnell rollen
Ich hab sie längst verloren, die Hoffnung an die Wahre Liebe
Guck wie ich den Champagner in mein Glas eingieße

Ich wollt das hier alles nicht und ich bin's Leid
Sie geht nicht vorbei, sie geht nicht vorbei, die Zeit

Ich behandle eine Schlampe wie 'ne Schlampe
Doch 'ne Prinzessin wie 'ne Königin
Doch momentan bin ich womöglich blind
Ich seh' in jeder Frau 'nen Teufel, ich weiß
Deswegen schaff ich's nicht freundlich zu sein, oh nein
Es heißt ich wär' kein Beziehungstyp, ich hab mein' Spaß
Ich muss raus, ich find' nachts kein' Schlaf
Danke Baby, man verliebt sich nur einmal
Um diesen Stress zu vergessen
Ich würde jeden Preis zahlen
Nur einmal wieder wunschlos glücklich sein
Sag, warum bloß ich, es bleibt
Nur eine tiefe Narbe, Bitch, darauf trink ich
Und, dass du eine weiße Weste hast, stimmt nicht
Obwohl's mir gut geht, muss ich in Sorgen schwimmen
Und glaub mir, ich scheiß' drauf was der nächste Morgen bringt
Vielleicht kommt irgendwann die Wahre Liebe
Guck wie ich den Champagner in mein Glas eingieße

Kay One,"Ich erzähl' euch 'ne Geschichte von 'ner ganz coolen Sau
Eines Tages tauchte ich vor so 'ner Tanzschule auf
Ich war betrunken grade auf dem Heimweg von 'ner Disco
Heißhunger und zwar auf zwei Hummer
Da stand ein großer Baum neben so ‘nem großen Haus
Und alles sah so nobel aus
Ich wollte reingehen und fragen ob sie Essen haben
Nur Senioren, die tanzten, schlechte Karten
Nur Omas, die mich anstarrten als wollten sie ein Autogramm haben
Ey Kleiner, das ist ein Tanzabend,
Ü-40, tschüsch, wirklich?
Hier kommt Frischfleisch Madame, ich bin wie'n Pfirsich, ah
Auf einmal kommt so 'ne operierte Dame
Die meint Ihr Mann ist schon seit Wochen auf Montage
Sie sagt mir, dass sie Renate heißt
Und ich denk mir, die ficke ich nur wenn ich 'ne Viagra schmeiß'
Sie fragt wie ich eigentlich heiß'
Ich lenk ab ich weiß Bescheid du bist verzweifelt allein
Das ist egal woher ich komm und egal wie ich heiß'
Wir verbringen diesen Abend zu zweit
Und sie schenkt mir ein Lächeln mit ihren gelben Raucherzähnen
Und ich muss der alten Frau helfen aufzustehen
Und ihre wässrigen Augen fragen
Kannst du mich nach Hause fahren?

Ich weiß nur, dass sie Renate heißt ho-oh
Sie trug das schönste Abendkleid uh-whoa
Sie war schon Anfang fünfzig
Der Apfelkorn war günstig
Sie nahm mich mit nach Haus
Ich kam auf ihrem Bauch

Die Tür geht auf ich sehe nur so einen Fettsack
Mit knallrotem Kopf geschockt, was für ein Pechtag!
„Drecksack, wer bist du? Nagelst meine Frau?“
Ja, dann fahr mich doch nach Haus
„Nein! Ich schlage dich jetzt blau“
Ha, komm versuch's Opa ich hab keine Angst
Auf einmal holt er seine Flinte aus dem Kleiderschrank
Und der Weihnachtsmann rennt auf mich zu
Schlägt mich boxt und ertränkt mich ihm Pool
„Du denkst du bist cool mit deiner roten Cappy""
Naja deine Frau fand mich heute obersexy
„Schnauze du Köter, Kind aus der Gosse“
„Warum schlagen Sie nicht die behinderte Fotze?
Ich wurde von ihr gezwungen, ich war doch noch Jungfrau“
Dumm gelaufen, auf einmal taucht sein Hund auf
Er sagte „Fass, auf Rex fass!
Mal schauen ob du mit meiner Frau Sex hast“
Auf einmal geht die Tür zur Wohnung auf
Ein Italiener mit langem Haar und Rosenstrauß
Und er schreit „Schatz, wer sind diese Männer?“
Und ich antworte „Wir sind die Klemptner wir haben nichts getan
Hier war ein Rohrbruch und außerdem wer bist du?
Mach mal nicht auf George Bush, wir können nix dafür
Wenn sie's nicht mehr bringen“
Ich fall auf die Knie und ich sing'

Ich weiß nur, dass sie Renate heißt ho-oh
Sie trug das schönste Abendkleid uh-whoa
Sie war schon Anfang fünfzig
Der Apfelkorn war günstig
Sie nahm uns mit nach Haus
Und da flog alles auf

Kay One,"Uh, ich seh' dich leiden und du weinst viel
Was ich mein, die Streitereien zum Beispiel
Wie er dich ausnutzt, deine Gutmütigkeit
Und ehrlich, mir tut's für dich Leid
Was du alles für Ihn tust
Die Wünsche von den Lippen liest
Ein Tipp von mir, geh und vergiss den Typ
Er hat dich nicht verdient, du hast es mitgespielt
Ich guck in dein Augen, dein Blick genügt
Ich würd' dir gern diese Entscheidung nehmen
Versuch dir beizustehen
Verdammt ich kann dich nicht mehr weinen sehen
Der Glanz in deinen Augen ist längst nicht mehr da
Ich hoff' dass du dich trennst von dem Arsch
Denk doch mal nach, es wird nicht wie früher
Einmal ein Lügner, für immer ein Lügner, Betrüger
Er wird es nie verstehen
Bei dir fließen Tränen
Es ist zu viel geschehen

Das Spiel, dass er mit dir spielt
Ist falsch weil er nichts mehr fühlt
Ja, du siehst nicht richtig hin
Und vor lauter Liebe bist du blind
Sag, wie oft willst du ihm noch verzeihen?
Verschwende nicht deine kostbare Zeit
Du siehst nicht richtig hin
Und vor lauter Liebe bist du blind (bist du blind)

Du bist blind, bist geblendet, bist verliebt
Dieser Typ hat die Geschenke nicht verdient
Du glaubst mir nicht, kein Ding, frag nach eurem Jahrestag
Und weißt du was die Antwort sein wird „Warte mal“
Du hast ihn deinen Eltern vorgestellt
Jetzt bereust du es, hast du's dir so vorgestellt?
Du warst für ihn da, als es ihm so scheiße ging
Eine Woche später, 'ne andere begleitet ihn
Du hast ihm gleich verziehn', obwohl's geschmerzt hat
Obwohl du wusstest, dass dieser Mann kein Herz hat
Ich hoff' du lernst was daraus
Denn die meisten Typen erkennen
Einfach nicht den Wert einer Frau
Es ist schwer zu vertrauen
Doch du hast es nicht kommen sehen
Merk dir eins, schlechte Menschen kommen und gehen
Er wird es nie verstehen
Bei dir fließen Tränen
Es ist zu viel geschehen

Das Spiel, dass er mit dir spielt
Ist falsch weil er nichts mehr fühlt
Ja, du siehst nicht richtig hin
Und vor lauter Liebe bist du blind
Sag, wie oft willst du ihm noch verzeihen?
Verschwende nicht deine kostbare Zeit
Du siehst nicht richtig hin
Und vor lauter Liebe bist du blind

Und ich frage mich bloß
Warum du noch bleibst
Du glaubst seiner Show, ich seh' doch wie du weinst
Doch es gibt kein Happy-End
Und glaub mir du verdienst einen besseren

Und ich frage mich bloß
Warum du noch bleibst

Residier' nur noch in den besten Hotels
Hier kommt ein Märchenprinz
Und ich schmeck untenrum wie ein Erdbeerdrink

Sportsfreund, ich bin nicht wie du
Egal was ich mach es sieht alles so leicht aus
Ich hab heut wieder nichts zu tun
Also geb ich Geld für irgendeinen Scheiß aus
Die Einkaufstüten sind so schwer
Verdammt dieses Leben ist nicht fair
Sportsfreund, ich bin nicht wie du

Hauttyp 4
Ich tauche auf wie Pierce
Brosnan und sauf' jetzt hier
Den ganzen Kaufmann, yeah
Ich fick' die Trainerin beim Tennisunterricht
Und mein Manager bin ich
Bange Jennifer, danach Elena, schneller als das Licht
Tellerwäscher bis Millionär, ich will so sehr reich sein
Du bleibst mein Feind, ich schreib eine Line, bye bye
Du Einstein, steig ein, nimm' teil an meinem Nightlife
Zwei, drei Mai Tai, und Bitches geben High Five
Ich weiß mein Style scheint unberechenbar
Bin ich auf der Bühne, liegt die Damen in Unterwäsche da
Über 100 Mädchen starren auf mich, weil ich ein Player bin
Und Kay der Prinz fickt die ganzen Wichser weil sie Hater sind
Kay One und Shindy, yippie Yippie Yo!
Das hier ist mein Schickie Mickie Flow

Kay One,"Herr, mir fehlt grad die Kraft
Mein ganzes Leben lang wart' ich dass
Alles gut wird, ich versink
In Selbstmitleid, weil das Geld nicht reicht
Ich bet' tags und bete nachts
Wieder halten mich Tränen wach
Papa ist nicht stolz auf mich
Doch ich wollt' das nicht, verzeih mir Mama
Seit ich geboren bin,
Bereit' ich nur Probleme und selbst wenn ich gehe,
Weiß ich, dass ich keinem von euch fehle
Eine Träne, läuft über meine Wange bis zum Kinn
Nein, ihr habt noch nie verstanden, was ich bin
Mein Handeln war so blind, denn ich denk nur mit dem Herz
Hatte keine gute Zeit, es tut mir Leid
Ich ertränke diesen Schmerz
Alkohol war nie mein Freund
Er hat mich zu Fall gebracht, mich beinah so oft kaltgemacht
Durch ihn fühl ich mich alt und schwach

An Tagen wie diesen
Würd' ich gerne eine Knarre nehmen
Und mir in den Kopf schießen
Warum tut ihr mir nur alle weh?
Ich suche nach dem Sinn, verfluche, was ich bin
Das Leben bleibt 'ne abgefuckte Hure, die dich lähmt
An Tagen wie diesen
Würd' ich gerne eine Knarre nehmen!

Mann, ich hab meine letzte Kugel
Aufbewahrt für diesen Tag
Und ein letztes Mal blick' ich in diesen Spiegel hier am Bad
Habe so viel falsch gemacht, den Typen
Den ich seh' das bin nicht ich
Und ich press' meine Augen zu und ich näher mich dem Licht
Lieber Gott verzeih mir meine Taten
Ich will bei dir sein und schlafen
Lass mich rein in deinen Garten
Ich bin es leid hier drauf zu warten
Warum flüstert dieser Teufel schlimme Dinge in mein Ohr?
Irgendwas muss an mir gut sein, denn ich bin nicht so geboren
Leb' in den Tag hinein und kenn' keine Moral, es tut mir Leid
Doch ich steh grade und bezahle diesen Preis
Ich sag' es tut mir Leid
Selbst wenn ich in der Hölle in der Glut verbrenn'
Weiß ich für mich selbst ich war ein guter Mensch

An Tagen wie diesen
Würd' ich gerne eine Knarre nehmen
Und mir in den Kopf schießen
Warum tut ihr mir nur alle weh?
Ich suche nach dem Sinn, verfluche, was ich bin
Das Leben bleibt 'ne abgefuckte Hure, die dich lähmt
An Tagen wie diesen
Würd' ich gerne eine Knarre nehmen!

Neureiche Wichser ohne Tischmanieren
Es ist ein Lamborghini, alles easy

Die Felgen sind verchromt, zweiundzwanzig Zoll
Haben die Taschen voll und machen, was wir wollen

Ich werde reich, sterbe jung, Bitches nehmen gern in Mund
Willst lieber AMG statt Fahrrad fahren, tja, dann lern' von uns
Ich wusste schon als Kind, dass ich irgendwann in Kohle bade
Aus dem S-Coupé hängen jetzt tättowierte Oberarme
Rauch' 'ne Zigarre, Bitch im Wert deiner Monatskarte
Al-Gear ist der Grund, warum ich keinen mehr nach Cola frage
Was „Promophase?“ Labert keinen Scheiß
Diggah, fast ganz Deutschrap arbeitet im Snipes
Aber will mir einen auf Promi machen, Kinder, macht doch Party
Die einzige Frau, auf die ich hör', ist nur die Stimme aus dem Navi
Mann, ich kling' wie ein Bugatti, wenn ich aus dem Tunnel fahr'
Du bist wie Katzenberger, weil deine Mutter aus dem Dschungel kam
Mach' auf unerfahren und werd' später Christian Grey

Nicht mal bei Fifa kommst du in meine Liga, du Amateur
Scheiß mal auf Straßenrap, Mann, ich brauch' keinen harten Text
Und trotzdem hat mein letzter Feind jetzt Hepatitis A bis Z
Vertick' auf Partys Pepp, knack' deinen Ferrari jetzt
Warum ich seine Mutter fick? (Keine Ahnung, ADS?)
Du machst auf G, doch kriegst von jedem hier auf's Maul
Bei deiner letzten Schlägerei war dein Gegner deine Frau
Und ich leg' noch einen drauf, Haribos sind out
Rap macht Spaß, solang man nicht wie Animus verkauft
Du bist raus, hast keinen Cent und prollst bei jeder Schlampe
Obwohl deine Taschen leerer sind wie Beamte
Kein Feature für Spastis, hau ab mit deinem Billig-Flow

Sie kommen nicht klar, denn keiner macht die Fresse auf wie Kay
Letztes Jahr noch auf dem Titelblatt der BILD
„Was sucht Kay bei RTL?“ Dieser Typ macht, was er will
Ich bin wieder krass am chillen, Kippe in der Fresse
Nationalspieler kommen und ficken meine Reste
Mittelfinger für die Presse, ich schätze, ihr habt mich unterschätzt
Was für Angst vor den Berlinern? Ich kack' auf Sonny Black
Diggah, Feuer frei, ich schieß', euer Style, mies
Lauf' in die Shishabar und deine Freundin schreit „Cüs!“
Bad Boy, Playboy, nichts hat sich geändert
Yeah, ihr disst euch alle, doch müsst abdrücken an die Gangster
Deine Rolex, ein Blender, ich merk's an dem Gewicht, Bitch
Ich merk' es an den Farben, dieses scheiß Modell gibt's nicht
Fick dich und fick den alten Kay und auch den ganz Alten
Kleiner, könntest du das Autogramm falten?
Sehr schön und jetzt steck's dir in den Arsch, Diggah

Ausschlafen und Geld zählen, darf ich vorstellen: Mein Leben

Und in mein Leben könnt ihr mir nicht reinreden
Battle gegen mich das kann ich einfädeln
Freestyle bedeutet, es wird Blei regnen
Wenn ich über Fake-Gangster rappe, ich mein' jeden
Sitzen nur im Studio, doch drohen sich im Netz
Posen wie Homos oben ohne, doch ihr Photoshop ist schlecht
Worum es geht? Das übliche: Kohle, Koka oder Crack
Den oberkrassen Benz, die Rolex und verlogenes Geschäft
Ich rappe jeden hier in Grund und Boden, ungelogen
Die Kripo fand in Bushidos Bett Spuren von Hundepfoten
Seid ihr Jungs auf Drogen? Guckt, wie euch der Mut verlässt
Warum ich wieder diss? Haha, ich hab Blut geleckt
Zuviel Cash, zuviel Zeit, Langeweile macht sich breit
Der krasse Hype bringt euch nichts, ihr seid beide angeleint
Und wieder werd' ich angezeigt, danke dir, Habibi
Danke, Herr Ferchichi, hast du mich verstanden? Mein Ya Zippy
Deutschlands P. Diddy, komme nicht klar mit dem Rapgeschäft
Kille meine Feinde mit dem besten Rap
Ab jetzt nennt ihr mich „Eure Exzellenz“

Und fick Chicks, während du die Decke vollwichst
More money, more problems, Kickdown und weg
Schlaf' bis mittags, mich kriegt man nicht aus dem Bett
Denn ich lebe, verdammt, ich lebe, Nutte, bei mir läuft
Weil sich im Tresor immer mehr Wertpapier häuft
Bad boy, tätowiert, Mittelfinger
Während deiner Sendung: ich ruf an ohne Kennung
Meine Weiber bleiben scheiß Stalker, tune mal dein' Corsa
Lamborghini schwarzweiß wie ein Orka

Ich park direkt vor'm Club und jede Bitch macht Druck
Zehn Blunts zu dem Grey Goose, nehm dir'n Schluck
Wir sind V.I.P.s, ich benehme mich, wie ich will
Wir sind V.I.P.s, ich benehme mich, wie ich will
Füll mein Glas auf, Bitch,?
Was für Fernsehen, Nigga, ich bin wirklich so
Wir sind V.I.P.s, ich benehme mich, wie ich will
Wir sind V.I.P.s, also bitte schieb keinen Film

Benehme mich, wie ich will, der größte Player, den du kennst
Ich kill jetzt jeden hier im Game und aus Hater wurden Fans
Fans, sie wollen jetzt ein Foto vor dem Benz
Drück' auf's Gas und ich fick jetzt diesen Opa im Cayenne
Macht, Ruhm und die Kohle wird zur Droge
Wie viel Kanonen zielen auf meine Krone?
Über dem Haus fliegt 'ne Drohne!
Das hier ist mein Fuhrpark, du Missgestalt
Deine Blaselippen auf dem Lauf und du frisst Metall
Ich hab meinen Traum wahr gemacht
Und dreh ich auf im Auto, fliegt dein ganzes Haus weg vom Bass
Du schiebst Ausländerhass, wenn du uns siehst
Denn wir haben Charme, schöne Frauen, Diggah, und Stil
Raus aus dem Block und rein in die 5-Sterne-Suiten
Hate APMC nicht, weil die Jungs mehr verdienen
Als deine Dreckscrew, Junge, du fährst jetzt Zug
Und ich sitze in 'nem S-Cou-pé!

Hier steht Belvedaire auf dem Tisch
Halt die Fresse du Verkehrspolizist!

Ich parke direkt vor dem Club yeah, 22 Zoll auf dem AMG
Und werf' euch meinen „Fickt euch alle!“-Blick sowie Kanye
Aktien statt Frauen Goldketten baumeln
Und als Trinkgeld gibt's Ohrfeigen weil ich wieder drauf bin
Haha, meine Clique ist hier im Club
Ich will den grössten Tisch für meine Jungs
Ich betrink' mich ohne Grund
Drei Liter, jeder Schein lila, zwei Shisha
Oversize T-Shirt wie ein Priester
Hör den Beat fast nicht weil die Frauen kreischen
Besoffen Handy rausholen und meine Autos zeigen
Du schaust die Geissens? Ich chille mit den Geissens
So tiefe Felgen du siehst kaum noch Reifen
Bad Boy, Check, Fick Nutten weg
Bei deiner Bitch war ich unterm Bett, yeah lass dir schmecken

Dein scheiß A6 im Handgelenk, Koka im Privatjet
Zocken, Chillen, Bitches, Base
Meine Feinde sind am kotzen denn ich bin fame-hey
Kay hör doch bitte auf rumzuprotzen
Ach halt dein Maul du scheiß Fotze, die Welt kostet

Frauen die sich immer zukoksen
Lamborghini Logo auf dem Swimmingpool Boden
Ich klatsch' den Piloten
Denn wenn ich fliegen will geht's nach oben
Diggah für mich gibt's kein Verboten
Bitches am posten
Chillen, wir grillen, rote Doublecups
Das Ober-Assi-Pack was soviel Money macht
Kickdown Fullspeed, der Wolf of Wallstreet
Ich überroll' sie, zweiundzwanzig Zoll fliegt
Pechschwarze Brille, weißer Hoodie
Und weil du prominent bist, film ich deine Pussy
Muschis hier, Muschis da

Leb dieses Leben so intensiv
Als hätte dein Herz noch einen Schlag
Zeig deinen Respekt, verneig dich tief
Denn dies ist vielleicht dein letzter Tag

Das, was ich heute besitz' schätze ich, ich hat' nichts
Nur meine Mucke, ich hab gehofft es klappt mit
Rap, ich wollte bloß auf Bühnen stehen
Mit meinem von Gott gegebenen Talent das Land übernehmen
Wollt's ihnen Zeigen, Menschen, die nicht dran geglaubt haben
Ich wollt ein Haus und meinen Traumwagen
Ohne Abi, ohne ihre Hilfe
Aber manchmal bist du alleine und schiebst Filme
Du fühlst dich wie Dreck, jeder andere macht cash
Arbeitsamt? Nein, sie behandeln dich Schlecht
Das letzte Wort, an alle meine Lehrer war:
""Ich werde reicher als all diese scheiß Streber""
10 Jahre später, ich blick nicht zurück
Manche meinen bloß, ich hatte Glück
Aber ich weiß, es war Gottes Wille
Und ich danke ihm

Ich kam von ganz unten, und wollte nach ganz oben
Papa hat mir gesagt, bleib immer auf dem Boden
Spar deine Kohlen, sei immer dankbar
Leg was zur Seite, das Leben ist verdammt hart
Lass dich nicht stressen, glaub mir alles wird gut
Damals fuhr ich im Zug, heute buch ich nen Flug
Aber ich weiß, woher ich komme
Und wo ich hin will, denn dort gibt es mehr davon
Mehr von dem Glück, mehr von der Ruhe
Was ich weiß wird man niemals lernen in der Schule
Familie ist alles, der Glaube mein Reichtum
Und Gesundheit kann man nicht kaufen, das weißt du
Ich bin dankbar für alles, für alles was ich gesehen hab
Erlebt, hab , mit dabei war, und es war nicht immer einfach

Irgendwie scheinen die Tage gezählt
Manchmal eine Million, manchmal zehn
Aber deine wurden noch nicht erwähnt
Du bist am Leben, du bist am Leben

Leb dieses Leben so intensiv
Als hätte dein Herz noch einen Schlag
Zeig deinen Respekt, verneig dich tief

Vieles nicht schön, mit so viel falschen Freunden
Gestritten und nie mehr versöhnt, life is a Bitch und ich ficke sie
Wenn ich an der Kippe zieh, denk ich nach
An früher mit meinen beiden Brüdern, die Sonne am Strand
Komm' nicht klar, heute fickt mich das Business
Und falsche Bitches lieben mich wegen Blitzlicht
Fühlen sich wichtig, das gibt's nicht, Bitch, ein Herz aus Stein bleibt

Die Mädels haben Spaß denn wir chillen auf 'ner Yacht
Und weil ich so viel Geld hab trag ich Sonnenbrillen Nachts
Mutterficker ich bin Kay
Wer von euch hat den selben hype
Wäre ich kein Rapper wär ich lange schon bei Calvin Klein
Du kannst putzen ich stell dich ein
Bring mir den Schampus sonst schlag ich auf den Kellner ein

Ich vermiss' meine Fam und das Essen
Fick jedes scheiß Restaurant, Mama kocht echt am besten

Ich hoff nur, dass ich meinen Flug heute schaffe
Termin in Berlin und dann direkt nach Wien
Wieder vor Tausenden spielen, mein Handy am klingeln
Meine Anwälte stressen, schon wieder nervt mich die Presse
Wieder Probleme, die Medien ficken meinen Schädel
Ich hoff, dass die Jungs alles regeln, es ist am Regnen
Und wir fahren schon echt lange
Um mich abzulenken schreib ich Autogramme
Les ein paar Briefe von meinen Fans
Wie oft hat mir das schon ein Lächeln geschenkt

Es geht vom Montag bis hin zum Freitag
Es geht vom Januar bis zum Dezember
Vom Urlaub keine Spur, ich bin bloß auf Tour
Blicke durch mein Hotelfenster
Und wenn ich nachts nach der Show dann einschlaf'
Merk ich mein Leben hat sich verändert
Von Freizeit keine Spur, sie tickt, die scheiß Uhr
Ich blick' aus meinem Hotelfenster

Ich steig' aus dem Bus, werd' sofort erkannt
Teens kommen angerannt mein Bekanntheitsgrad
In Deutschland ist echt krass
Ich hätt's niemals gedacht
Dass sich all meine Massenhysterie entfacht
Schuhklassen, an jedem Flughafen
Jugendliche die auf ihren Zug warten machen Selfies
Und stellen die Fotos online
Kids ziehen sich die Songs rein
Ich mach das hier gern, und ich will ihnen zeigen
Egal wer du bist du kannst alles erreichen
Du musst nur drauf scheißen
Wenn Neider meinen du wirst es niemals reißen
Klar dieser Job macht mich müde
Und sehr oft ist es hart
Doch es ist das was ich wollte
Der Junge ohne Abschluss ist heute ein Star

I'm tryin to remember
Did I get in a fight?
Why are my pocket's empty?
I feel like im dyin'
Fuck, what happened last night?
Fuck what happened last night
Fuck what happened last night

Bitte sag mir was ist nur passiert
Wie kam ich von der Disco zu mir?
Warum ist von dem Cash alles weg?
Wiedermal im Suff 10 SMS an die Ex!
Kopffick, keiner Stopt mich!
Sechs Liter Wodka, das bockt und es lockt, aber Knockt dich aus
Dikka was fürn Rausch?
Und der Türsteher gab mir so krass auf's Maul!
Was ich brauch?! Aspirin!
Ein Verbandskasten, mann Ich hass Jim Beam
Hass Grey Goose, man Ich hass' Tequila
Und schwör jedes mal „Ja Ich mach's nicht wieder!“
Wodka Kirsches auf meinem Shirt
Jacky Coke auf den Schuhen
Die Polizei wieder vor dem Hotel
Ich Verpiss mich hier Schnell
Tja ich werd schon wieder gesucht
Mit den Bitches im Pool!
Ich dacht, ich bin einfach der Boss
Und vor dem Sex, hab ich Depp einfach drei-mal gekotzt!
Und bin dann betrunken ins Taxi gestiegen
Erzählte dem Fahrer dann was über Kriesen!
Über Liebe, über das Leben
Ich mein da Vorne hat sich der Typ übergeben
Ja man, ich konnt' nicht mehr Stehen und Gehen
Und wollt so 'ne Grotte von Mädel mitnehmen
Alk ist der Teufel
Ich erinner' mich an kaum was
Hab ihre Titten angefasst und dann gesagt Baby Chill
Bevor dem Rap-Ding war ich Hausarzt!
Sauf' was, mit mir
Im Kühlschrank ist Bier!
Baby greif zu, heut bin ich echt Blau!
Was für ein Blackout!

Wo ist mein Auto? Ich seh' bloß ein Taxi!
In mei'm Vorgarten, ich benehm' mich so assi!
Blau schlag ich auch Paparazis
Und sag zu dem Bullen kauf meine Maxi!
Versuch vom Dach in den Pool zu springen
Mama weiß, ich war nie ein gutes Kind!
Denn der Badboy schmiss seine Schule hin
Zu viel Gin das sind meine Jugendsün-
-Den zurück zur Story!
In meinem Flur steht ein verficktes Pony!
Man wie krass, man mein versnoppter Nachbar
Liegt in der Badewanne wie ein Bastard!
Zahnarzt ich mach schnell ein Selfie
Beweisfoto muss sein!
Ich habe meine Kohle leider wiedermal verballert
Bis zum Monatsende keinen großen Schein!
Mein Gehirn wie Brei!
Wodka, Energy raub den Schlaf!
Ich wach auf und blick auf 'nen Arsch
Doch als ich dann ihr Gesicht sah
Erinnerte mich ihre Fresse an eine Pizza!
Und sie sagt „Guten Morgen“
Ich sag, Bitch Gute Nacht!
Wie konnt ich das tun ja mir kommen schon die Tränen vom Lachen
Und sie meint nur fick dich du Spast!
Und ich zünd' mir 'ne Kippe an und dann
Denk ich wo ist eigentlich Uhr und die Klunker?
Ich lauf' runter noch Blau, und es geht schlecht
Schlüssel und das scheiß Portmonee weg!
Jeden Sonntag nehm' ich mir vor, nie wieder zu trinken
So oft schon geschworen aber dann kommt wieder der Freitag

Kay One,"Ich hab gedacht, dass es leicht wär
Es wird mir klar, ich muss eins lern'
Schmerz geht, doch die Narben sind für immer
Die Hoffnung scheint unauffindbar
War ich zu jung oder nur zu dumm?
Das mit dir hatte Zukunft
Schatz, ich wollte was festes
Es war'n deine Worte, entweder so oder man lässt es
Ich gab dir mein Wort, hab noch geschwor'n
War noch im Studio, machte 'nen Song
Jeden Tag draußen, Kino, spazier'n
All diese Bilder, sie sind noch hier
Verdammt, ich vermiss dich
Komm zurück, ich werd' anders nicht glücklich
Und ja, ich versteh, was du meinst
All meine Fehler, ich seh sie jetzt ein, dass ich
Nicht da war, das tut mir so Leid
Du hast noch versucht, nicht zu wein'
Auch wenn du jetzt glücklich bist
Bitte vergiss mich nicht, Gott beschütze dich

Zusammen mit dir aufsteh'n, ich sehn' mich so sehr
Die Zeit will nicht vergeh'n, jetzt erkenn' ich dein Wert
Und manchmal tut es weh, wenn man etwas verliert
Die Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt, deshalb blick ich zur Tür

Doch es gibt kein Wiederseh'n, Wiederseh'n, Wiederseh'n
Denn es ist so viel gescheh'n, viel gescheh'n, viel gescheh'n
Allein geh ich jetzt diesen Weg, diesen Weg, diesen Weg
Hast du nicht gesagt „Ich begleit dich ins Grab?“

Wenn ich aufsteh und am Frühstücken bin
Schatz, glaub mir, ich fühl mich so schlimm
Kein Chill'n, kein Kuscheln, kein Sex
Ich sitz nur zuhause und schreib Tracks
Doch jeder Track ist über dich
Ich will, dass es wieder wie früher ist
Weißt du noch, unser erster Kuss
Unser erstes Date, brachte dich zum Bus
Alles war zu schön, doch was ist jetzt?
Das passiert, wenn man jemanden nicht schätzt
Ja, du bist weg, aber wohin?
Sag, warum war ich so blind?
Nein, Geld macht nicht glücklich
Was bringt ein 5-Sterne-Koch, wenn du nichts isst?
Was bringt dir Urlaub allein, Champagner und Wein?
Nein, es bringt dir nichts, wenn du kein' hast zum Teil'n
Jetzt bist du frei, also genieß diese Zeit
Baby, nie wieder Streit und ich will, dass du weißt
Dass ich immer da bin
Bitte pass auf sie auf, amen

Zusammen mit dir aufsteh'n, ich sehn' mich so sehr
Die Zeit will nicht vergeh'n, jetzt erkenn' ich dein Wert
Und manchmal tut es weh, wenn man etwas verliert
Die Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt, deshalb blick ich zur Tür

Doch es gibt kein Wiederseh'n, Wiederseh'n, Wiederseh'n
Denn es ist so viel gescheh'n, viel gescheh'n, viel gescheh'n
Allein geh ich jetzt diesen Weg, diesen Weg, diesen Weg
Hast du nicht gesagt „Ich begleit dich ins Grab?“

Wenn wir zwei allein
Jetzt uns're Wege geh'n
Ich hoff, du weißt
Egal, was auch passiert
Ich bin für dich da
Ich hoff, es gibt ein Wiederseh'n

Doch es gibt kein Wiederseh'n, Wiederseh'n, Wiederseh'n
Denn es ist so viel gescheh'n, viel gescheh'n, viel gescheh'n
Allein geh ich jetzt diesen Weg, diesen Weg, diesen Weg

Kay One,"Irgendwann sehen wir uns wieder
Irgendwann bin ich bereit
Irgendwann merk ich dass du, all die Lieder für mich schreibst

Und wir beide schau'n zurück
Gott wird helfen, doch wir zwei
Wir verschenkten unser Glück
Irgendwann bin ich allein und dann fällt´s mir wieder ein
All die Jahre war ich dein

Mir fällt es schwer, doch ich kann es nicht mehr
Du bist heut anders, ich hab es schon lange gemerkt
Du bist nicht mehr diese Frau die mich geliebt hat, nein, Schatz
In deiner Welt gibt es für einen wie mich kein' Platz
Sag wie lang hab ich um dich gekämpft
Nichts mehr gegessen und nicht gepennt
Wie lange hab ich auf mein Handy gestarrt
Obwohl ich wusste, du bist längst nicht mehr da
Hab mir eingeredet, dass die Hoffnung zuletzt stirbt
Und gesehen, dass in den Medien gehetzt wird
Heute weiß ich, sie wollten uns trenn', denn
Leider ist nicht alles Gold, was hier glänzt
Wir waren zu jung, für den Schritt nicht bereit
Vielleicht war es auch nicht die richtige Zeit
Eifersucht und Streit durch den Druck
Sekunde, ich gönne mir noch kurz 'nen Schluck
Denk jeden Tag an dich, wenn ich aufsteh, raus geh
Wie viele Songs muss ich noch aufnehm'n?
Kein', denn das war mein Letzter
Was mach's gut? Ok, mach's besser
Doch denk dran, ich wünsch dir das Beste
Zeig deinen Kindern meine 10000 Texte und lächle
Denn wir hatten eine gute Zeit

Gott wird helfen, doch wir zwei
Wir verschenkten unser Glück
Irgendwann bin ich allein und dann fällt´s mir wieder ein
All die Jahre war ich dein

Schlaflose Nächte, eiskaltes Herz
Und jede Scheiß-Party war's einfach nicht wert
So oft war ich von den Weibern genervt
Blick in mein Inneres, ich zeig dir den Herbst
Ich leide nicht mehr, wenn ich uns're Bilder seh
Wie oft hast du mir gesagt, du willst nicht geh'n?
Wie oft hast du mir gesagt, bleib für immer?
Ein Foto von dir? Ich hab gar keins im Zimmer
Baby, ich hab abgeschlossen
Wie viele Jahre war ich nachts besoffen?
Wie viele Male hab ich mich geschlagen?
Ich schwör, ich konnt diesen Kopfschmerz nicht ertragen
Meine Wut raus gelassen, hab mich nicht im Griff
Doch scheiß drauf, egal, es ist, wie es ist
Bleib wie du bist, du gehst dein' Weg
Das sind Geschichten, die das Leben erzählt
Ich wünsch dir das Beste, ein Haus mit 'nem Garten
Ein' Mann, der dich liebt, mit 'nem fetten Sportwagen
Zwei Mädchen und zwei Jungs, wie du's wolltest
Auf dass sie gut in der Schule sind und du stolz bist
Viel Geld, doch am meisten Gesundheit
Dass du noch die nächsten 50 Jahre jung bleibst
Und dass Gott dich beschützt
Vergiss mich nicht

Kay One,"I´m trying hard to understand
How the world keeps spinning around while you´re not here with me
Didn´t had the chance to make it there
Couldn´t even say good bye, thought it last forever
Keep on praying, keep keep on praying, say we keep on praying for now
Say we keep on praying, keep keep on praying, say we keep on praying for now
And we will see each other again
One day we´re gonna understand it´s plans
Remember all the good times that we had and I promise, I´ll never forget you

Ich blick in den Himmel und rede mit dir
Ich würd‘ es dir geben das Leben von mir
Ich kann‘s nicht verstehen und ich möcht es auch nicht
Dreh dich nicht um, lauf direkt in das Licht
Wir alle waren da, an deinem schneeweißen Sarg
Und trugen dich wirklich zu zehnt an dein Grab
Jeder war da, glaub mir jeder war da
So viele Fotos von dir und die Tränen sie kamen
Ich zählte nicht nach, so viele Kerzen am brennen
Du warst so ein herzlicher Mensch
Egal wo du warst, du hast Freude bereitet
Wolltest dich nie mit den Freunden drum streiten
Ich schreib hier die Zeilen, mit meinem Blut
Wer will mich trösten, nichts mehr ist gut
Nichts mehr wird so sein, wie es einmal war
Bitte bleib doch da

And we will see each other again
One day we´re gonna understand it´s plans
Remember all the good times that we had and I promise, I´ll never forget you

And we will see each other again
One day we´re gonna understand it´s plans
Remember all the good times that we had and I promise, I´ll never forget you

Ich sitz am PC und seh diese Videos von uns
Und all unsere Songs hab‘ ich nie mehr gepumpt
Es zieht mich so runter es bringt mich nur um
Ich würd‘ gern weiterleben, doch find keinen Grund
Mir läuft´s eiskalt gerade den Rücken hinunter
Bald mach ich mir dein Tattoo auf die Schulter
Mit deinem Todestag
Man ich bete millionen Mal für dich, ich sterbe grad ohne Spaß
Wie oft hab‘ ich Gott gefragt und gehofft, dass er antwortet
Schmeiß mir ein Seil in das Loch, ich will raus
Alles erinnert an dich
Denk ich an gute Zeiten, verschlimmert es sich
Es tut weh, ich war für den Scheiß nicht bereit
Ich fahr durch die Nacht, verkneif mir das weinen
Vorbei ist die Zeit, als wir das Leben noch liebten
Ruhe in Frieden

And we will see each other again
One day we´re gonna understand it´s plans
Remember all the good times that we had and I promise, I´ll never forget you

Why you have to go and leave me on my own
In my heart I know, the angels ?

And we will see each other again
One day we´re gonna understand it´s plans
Remember all the good times that we had and I promise, I´ll never forget you

No I never forget you
No I never forget you",One Day [Instrumental]

Everybody's somebody's plaything
And there are no exceptions to the rule
Yes, everybody's somebody's fool

Yet, darling, I'd be twice as blue without you
It hurts but I come running back for more

You'll know how much this heart of mine is breaking

Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,

A-ploughin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw.

Yippy-I-Ay, yippy-I-oh!
A ghost herd in the sky!

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel,
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel.

On horses snortin' fire, as they ride on hear them cry;

As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name,

Is her delight, they say,

There was Hannah pouring water on a drownding man!

Nevermore to call your name
When you left you broke my heart 
That will never make us part
Every hour in the day 
You will hear me say 
Baby, won't you please come home
I mean, baby, won't you please come home

Baby, won't you please come home
'Cause your mama's all alone
I have tried in vain 
Nevermore to call your name 
When you left you broke my heart 
That will never make us part
Landlord's gettin' worse
I gotta move May the first 
Baby, won't you please come home
I need money

Kay Starr,"You leave me alone, you don't even phone
You're carefree as a bird in the sky
But what goes up must come down
And, Baby, you've been flying too high

It's all over town, you're chasing around
But I'm not gonna sit home and cry
Remember what goes up must come down
And, Baby, you've been flying too high

You ought to get your walkin' papers
But now it's too late
Because I know you too well
When you're through cuttin' capers
You break down my gate
To ring my front door bell

So go have your fling, and don't miss a thing
I'll see you down to earth by and by
Remember what goes up must come down
And, Baby, you've been flying too high",Flyin' Too High (What Goes up Must Come Down)
Kay Starr,"I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me",I Cried for You
Kay Starr,"I'm confessin' that I love you,
Tell me, do you love me too?
I'm confessin' that I need you,
Honest I do, need you every moment.
In your eyes I read such strange things,
But your lips deny they're true,
Will your answer really change things
Making me blue?

I'm afraid some day you'll leave me,
Saying ""can't we still be friends""
If you go, you know you'll grieve me,
All in life on you depends.
Am I guessin' that you love me,
Dreaming dreams of you in vain,
I'm confessin' that I love you, over again.",I'm Confessin' (That I Love You)
Kay Starr,"Into each life some rain must fall
But too much is falling in mine
Into each heart some tears must fall
But some day the sun will shine

Some folks can lose the blues in their hearts
But when I think of you another shower starts
Into each life some rain must fall
But too much is falling in mine

Into each and every life some rain has got to fall
But too much of that stuff is fallin' into mine
And into each heart some tears gotta fall
And I know that someday that sun is bound to shine

Some folks can lose the blues in their heart
But when I think of you another shower starts
Into each life some rain must fall
But too much is fallin' in mine",Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall
Kay Starr,"You may spell love with capital ""L"" 
But I spell love with a capital ""You"" 
Through the day you're away 
And I'm mopin, mopin mope 
And you do too, I hope, I hope, I hope 
All life through, love with a capital ""You"" 
Would just suit me to a capital ""T"" 
I can spell just as well as the dictionaries do, 
But I spell love with a capital ""You""!","Love With a Capital ""You"""
Kay Starr,"I hate to see that evening sun go down, 
I hate to see that evening sun go down, 
'Cause my lovin' baby done left this town. 

If I feel tomorrow, like I feel today, 
If I feel tomorrow, like I feel today, 
I'm gonna pack my trunk and make my getaway. 

Oh, that St. Louis woman, with her diamond rings, 
She pulls my man around by her apron strings. 
And if it wasn't for powder and her store-bought hair, 
Oh, that man of mine wouldn't go nowhere. 

I got those St. Louis blues, just as blue as I can be, 
Oh, my man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea, 
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me. 

I love my man like a schoolboy loves his pie, 
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his rocker and rye 
I'll love my man until the day I die, Lord, Lord. 

I got the St. Louis blues, just as blue as I can be, Lord, Lord! 
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea, 
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me. 

I got those St. Louis blues, I got the blues, I got the blues, I got the blues, 
My man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea, 
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me, Lord, Lord!",St. Louis Blues
Kay Starr,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Kay Starr,"Don't know why
There's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time 

Life is bare
Gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather
Just can't get my poor old self together
I'm weary all the time, the time
So weary all of the time 

When he went away
The blues walked in and met me
If he stays away, old rocking chair will get me
All I do is pray
The lord above will let me
Walk in the sun once more 

Can't go on
Everything I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time
Keeps raining all of the time 

I walk around,
Heavy-hearted and sad
Night comes around
And I'm still feeling bad
Rain pourin' down
Blinding every hope I had
This pitter 'n patter 'n beatin' 'n spatterin' drivin' me mad 

Love, love, love, love
This misery will be the end of me 

When he went away
The blues walked in and met me
If he stays away, old rocking chair will get me
All I do is pray
The lord above will let me
Walk in the sun once more 

Can't go on
Everything I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time, the time
Keeps raining all the time",Stormy Weather
Kay Starr,"It seems we stood and talked like this before.
We looked at each other in the same way then,
But I can't remember where or when.

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore.
The smile you were smiling you were smiling then,
But I can't remember where or when.

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again.

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before and loved before,
But who knows where or when?",Where or When
