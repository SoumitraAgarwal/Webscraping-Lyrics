Jive Bunny & the Mastermixers,"Baby, baby, baby don't leave me
Ooh, please don't leave me all by myself
I've got this burning, burning, yearning feelin' inside me
Ooh, deep inside me and it hurts so bad

You came into my heart (baby, baby) so tenderly
With a burning love (baby, baby)
That stings like a bee (baby, baby)
Now that I surrender (baby, baby) so helplessly
You now want to leave (baby, baby)
Ooh, you wanna leave me (baby, baby)
Ooh (baby, baby)

Baby, baby, where did our love go?
Ooh, don't you want me?
Don't you want me no more (baby, baby)?
Ooh, baby

Baby, baby, where did our love go?
And all your promises of a love forevermore!
I've got this burning, burning, yearning feelin' inside me
Ooh, deep inside me, and it hurts so bad

Before you won my heart (baby, baby)
You were a perfect guy
But now that you got me
You wanna leave me behind (baby, baby)
Ooh, baby

Baby, baby, baby don't leave me
Ooh, please don't leave me all by myself (baby, baby)
Ooh baby, baby, baby",Where Did Our Love Go
Jive Bunny & the Mastermixers,"I need love, love to ease my mind,
I need to find, find someone to call mine,
But mama said you can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy,
It's a game of give and take.
You can't hurry love,
No, you just have to wait,
You gotta trust, give it time,
No matter how long it takes;
But how many heartaches must I stand
Before I find a love to let me live again.
Right now the only thing that keeps me hanging on,
When I feel my strength, yeah, it's almost gone,
I remember mama said,

You can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy,
It's a game of give and take.
How long must I wait how much more can I take,
Before loneliness will 'cause my heart, heart to break?
No, I can't bear to live my life alone.
I grow impatient for a love to call my own,
But when I feel that I, I can't go on,
These precious words keeps me hanging on,
I remember mama said,

Can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy,
it's a game of give and take.

You can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy,
It's a game of give and take
No matter how long it takes.

No love, love don't come easy,
But I keep on waiting, anticipating for that
Soft voice to talk to me at night,
For some tender arms to hold me tight.
I keep waiting; I keep on waiting,
But it ain't easy, it ain't easy when mama said

You can't hurry love no,
You just have to wait,
She said trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes.

You can't hurry love
You just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take.",You Can't Hurry Love

Why can't I learn to let go?
Why can't I live and let live

Where I bang my head on the sky?
Why can't I just forgive?

Matte-black like melanin on melanin
Of course the butter soft, black leather trim, set of rims
Let 'er purr, not a scratch on it
Spin it back to the garage and put a latch on it
I need a handful of melanin
Feelin' like the lambswool beard on your tender skin
It might give you a shock initially
As we reconnect up the flow, electricity
The phenomenal melanin bio-polymer
Follow with a glass a Merlot, I could swallow her
Eat 'er up like a SnackWell
We could live forever like Henrietta Lacks cells

Holdin' hands, feet in the sand, grounded
Starin' in them pretty brown eyes, astounded
I'll share some solar power

And then again in the shower
Left her leg tremblin', recharged the melanin

Infinity of space
It destroys this special place
Of momentary bliss
It's the thorn in a kiss

Sadness and you have become my perfect two
In a world I divide what is good and what I do

But these feelings are feelings only god knows
As the figures fade into the distance
You're at home now, need for resistance

Marble exterior so cold
But like magic your soul puts things on hold
The truth is you've heard it all before
Oh these feelings, the sea just brings you more

And you sink further into yourself
And you think only of yourself
And you sink further into yourself
When you sink wanting to be someone else

If this body is but a grain of sand
Then friend I need to take your hand
But these feelings have too many windows
But these windows are guarded by the angels

And you sink further into yourself
And you think only of yourself
And you sink further into yourself
And you sink wanting to be someone else

And you sink further into yourself
And you sink wanting to be someone else",Sinking

I haven't loved you in a long, long time
so why do I feel this way?

Can you hear my heartbeat?
Please don't stand so close to me
Can you hear my heartbeat still beating strong?

Maybe I'm ashamed to want you back
Maybe I'm afraid you'll never stay
Thought I hated you a long, long time
There was my mistake

I just can't pretend that nothing's changed
Can you comprehend just what to say?
If you break my heart a second time
I might never be the same

Can you hear my heartbeat?
Please don't stand so close to me
Can you hear my heartbeat still beating strong?

I haven't loved you in a long, long time
Thought I hated you a long, long time
If you break my heart one more time
I won't ever be the same.

He venido a confesarle
He cometido un delito
Ud debe encarcelarme

(de verdad no entiendo nada)
Bueno sin contar detalles
A la mujer de mi vida
Le rompí el corazon

Entonces buscala buscala ya!
Que no se te haga muy tarde
Y no pueda perdonarte
Ni dar marcha atras..
Entonces buscala buscala ya!
Que no se te haga muy tarde
Mira que yo por cobarde
Perdi a mi amor

Ooh uohh ouoh
Perdi a mi amor
Ooh uohh ouoh
Perdi a mi amor

Yo tampoco me atrevi a buscarla en el momento
Aunque nunca pude dejarla de amar
Poco a poco se convierte en mi enemigo el tiempo
Se la llevo sin vuelta atras

Ay yo le pido a mi pana que no se ponga terco
Por ella pongase a luchar
Mas vale amor seguro que cuatrocientas corriendo
(he dicho!) pongase a pensar

No se si mi condena será seguir solo
O sentenciarme a no volverla a ver
Yo solo estoy seguro
De que me arrepiento de su sufrimiento

Entonces buscala buscala ya!
Que no se te haga muy tarde
Y no pueda perdonarte
Ni dar marcha atras..
Entonces buscala buscala ya!
Que no se te haga muy tarde
Mira que yo por cobarde
Perdi a mi amor

Ooh uohh ouoh
Perdi a mi amor
Ooh uohh ouoh
Perdi a mi amor

Y a pesar de los fracasos he encontrado el tiempo
Voy buscando su rastro detras de su aliento
Yo se que he fallado y aqui me arrepiento
En fin
Sin ella a mi la vida se me va perdiendo
Si no la tengo a mi lado sintiendo su cuerpo
Un corazon desolado que se esta muriendo
Y vuela y vuelve ma'
Que tu iluminas mi sendero
Y vuela y vuelve ma'
Que nada es igual sin ti

Entonces buscala buscala ya!
Que no se te haga muy tarde
Y no pueda perdonarte
Ni dar marcha atras
Entonces buscala buscala ya!
Que no se te haga muy tarde
Mira que yo por cobarde
Perdi a mi amor

No hagas como hicieron j-king y el maximan

Laughing, joking, everything's blessed
The right-hand lane's uncharted territory
Everyone's on the left
But man's in a four wheel drive
So I get brave and I stay on the right
The snow gets thick and the car slips
To the left, I smashed the windscreens in bits

Filled up the tank and came straight to my yard

Came back, him and Dan went inside
I thought why not? The weather's fine
Fuck it, let me go for a ride
I was riding slow but the weather turned quick
I turned too low in the rain and slipped
I broke the gear shift, got it fixed
But for that whole week I know Dan was pissed
But he didn't say a thing, real bredrin

Jo Dee Messina,"I remember when I was a little girl
Growin' up livin' in my own little world
So it seemed
I had my dolls and dreams

Mama was always there to comfort me
And her love
Wasn't nothin' quite like it
In the world that I knew of

Before I knew it, I was standing in my teens
Sweet little boy with his strong young arm holdin' me

I remember the first time I felt his kiss
Oh, it like to drove me crazy
And I remember sayin' I never felt nothin' like this

So I went and asked mama
Can you tell me what it means
And she said, you're in love
And that's every little girls dream

Baby, what you've found
Is every little girls dream

So I said, mama does love ever last
She says, where by now let the future come to pass
Just understand and enjoy what you've found
And listen to it just as long as your heart is sound

And love, there ain't nothin' quite like it
In the world anybody knows of
There are worlds all through my teens
Same little boy with his strong young arm lovin' me

I remember the first time I felt his kiss
Oh, it like to drove me crazy
And I remember sayin' I never felt nothin' like this

I remember sayin' to mama
I know just what you mean
I'm in love, and that's every little girl's dream

Woah, what I found
Is every little girl's dream

And I found mine, and mama says, me too baby
Once upon a time
It lifts you up, but it lets you down

There'll be another dream to bring it back around
There's something about the first time
That keeps you rememberin'
When you've found every little girl's dream

Every little girl's dream
I found
Every little girl's dream

Jo Dee Messina,"His heart was tougher than a piece of leather
Had a will carved out of stone
He was stallion who had thrown every rider
No woman could seem to hang on
He had always been a fortress
With walls to high to climb
But then again he'd never seen Julie cry

He wasn't lookin' for a woman
He was racin' with the wind
But he kinda took to Julie
Cause she kept up with him
Thought he'd out run her like the others
Leave her somewhere down the line
But then again he'd never seen Julie cry

He never thought that love would hit him
Like a train comin' out of the dark
He never thought a friend would hand him the keys to his own heart
He was like a ragin' river
One that's just to rough to ride
But then again he'd never seen Julie cry

But then again he'd never seen Julie cry

Oh how he wanted just to hold her
And wipe away the tears
But she turned him a cold shoulder
Said I've tried lovin' you for years
He didn't know that it was over
He thought he could make it right
But then again he'd never seen Julie cry

Jo Dee Messina,"Baby what do you say we just get lost
Leave this one horse town like two rebels without a cause
I've got people in Boston, ain't your daddy still in Des Moines
We can pack tomorrow, tonight let's flip a coin

Heads Carolina, tails California
Somewhere greener, somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains, down by the ocean
Where don't matter long as we're goin'
Somewhere together, I got a quarter
Heads Carolina, tails California

We can load what we own in the back of a U-Haul van
Couple modern day Moses' searchin' for the promised land
We can go four hundred miles before we stop for gas
Hey, we'll drive for a day and then we'll take a look at the map

Heads Carolina, tails California
Somewhere greener, somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains, down by the ocean
Where don't matter long as we're goin'
Somewhere together, I got a quarter

Boy, we're bound to outrun the bad luck that's tailin' us

Quietly cursing him and this love
While she's rehearsing every line
She's gonna say when she walks away
On a wing and a prayer

Looking back at her in the mirror is a stranger
Years that have passed, how they seemed to change her
A woman once able to stand on her own
Searches for strength to stand on her own
On a wing and a prayer

On a wing and a prayer
She's leaving tonight
Holding her heart in her hands
Somewhere out there she knows that she'll find a love that understands
Why she left there on a wing and a prayer

She held on to maybe as long as she could, knowing he wouldn't
Believing he would, give her a single reason to stay
To keep her from breaking away on a wing and a prayer

Jo Dee Messina,"I've never been one to believe much in ghosts,
But to tell you the truth now, my mind is not closed.
I've heard there are souls that are lost in between
Somewhere they're goin', and the places they've been.
That sounds a lot like a woman I know,
Her love is long gone, but she will not let go.
Somebody ought a take her by the hand and tell her,

""Don't be afraid, just walk to the light.
Let go of the past and get on with your life.""
Somebody's waiting out in the night,
Ashes to ashes, walk to the light.

Now I understand that some things can take time,
Especially those of the heart grievin' kind.
But there comes a point you've got to move on ahead,
Read the last rites and bury the dead.
Said she can't make the journey to get past the pain.
She moans in the night and she rattles her chains.
Somebody ought a take her in their arms and tell her,

""Don't be afraid, just walk to the light.
Let go of the past and get on with your life.""
Somebody's waitin' out in the night,
Ashes to ashes, walk to the light.

Oh, don't be afraid of the choices that you made,
The choices are behind you.
When you give in, the healin' can begin,
Love is gonna find you.

Don't be afraid, just walk to the light.
Let go of the past and get on with your life.
Somebody's waitin' out in the night,
Ashes to ashes,
Oh, oh, don't be afraid just walk to the light,
Let go of the past and get on with your life.

Jo Dee Messina,"He said ""I grew up in Wichita
In a Mayberry kind of town""
He never liked overalls
Or haulin' hay 'til sundown
He said he dreamed about L.A.
As he plowed away the day on an old John Deere
I said ""Boy let me warn you
In southern California there's some fast trains here""

So we drove up to Malibu
Cruisin' down Sunset Strip
I let him steal a kiss or two
Under the Hollywood sign

Here we say Rodeo, not rodeo

Well it's been long enough

Bye bye love I'll catch you later
Got a left foot down on my accelerator and the rear view mirror torn off

I've got pride I'm takin' it for a ride

Don't think all those tears are gonna hold me here like they've done before
You'll find what's left of us in a cloud of dust on highway 4
Baby what did you expect me to do
Just sit around and wait on you
Well I'm through watchin' you just skate around the truth
And I know it sounds trite
I've seen the light

Got a left foot down on my accelerator and the rear view mirror torn off

I'd lost the game I guess
I did my best to win the part
Now I'm leavin' here with what's left of my heart

His life gone like it was nothin' to lose
And for the shoes there on his feet
Yes even God must get the blues

When the rain falls down from heaven, it must be the angels cryin'
For all the sorrow in the world tonight

So they can't see it's been battered and bruised
Like she's the one to blame

I knew we'd meet again another time, another place
Can't believe it's been so many years
We better grab a chair and a couple of beers
You're lookin' good in your three piece suit
You know I always knew you'd take the business route
You were always the one who followed the light and
You look like you're doing alright

I've been singing for my rent and singing for my supper
I'm above the below and below the upper
I'm stuck in the middle where the money gets tight

Well we raised a lot of hell when we were younger
They thought we were crazy but we had the hunger
We kept a lot of friends and skipped a lot of class
Been on top of the world and knocked on our ass
Lost touch, we lost in love
And lost our minds when things got tough
But beating time is a losing fight
But I guess I'm doing alright

So I guess I'm doing alright

Well I hate to see this evening end
God only knows when I'll see you again
Send a fax or send me a letter
Or give me a call that will even be better
Give the wife a kiss for me
And say hello to the family
Tell them all my future's looking bright and I miss them

So I worked two jobs 
And I moved three times 
I ended up south of Memphis, workin' down in Riverside 
I may not be so lucky in love 
But the one thing I'm sure of 

I want a man that stands beside me 
Not in front of or behind me 
Give me two arms that want to hold me, not own me 
And I'll give all the love in my heart 
Stand beside me 
Be true, don't tell lies to me 
I'm not lookin' for a fantasy 
I want a man that who stands beside me 

I didn't expect to see him, one hot July morning 
His hair was longer but his eyes were the same old blue 
He said, ""I've missed you for so long. Oh baby, what can I do?"" 
I said, ""I want a man that stands beside me

It's almost like the hard times circle 'round
A couple drops and they all start coming down
Yeah, I might feel defeated,
And I might hang my head
I might be barely breathing, but I'm not dead

Tomorrow's another day
And I'm thirsty anyway
So bring on the rain

No I'm not gonna let it get me down
I'm not gonna cry
And I'm not gonna lose any sleep tonight

'Cause tomorrow's another day
And I'm not afraid
So bring on the rain

Are you gonna be a doctor and heal
Or go to heaven and touch God's face
Are you gonna be a dreamer who sleeps
Are you gonna be a sinner who weeps
Or an angel under grace

You and me baby, can meet for the weekend
To solidify our plans
We'll follow a jet stream to some place exotic
All in the name of romance...
‘Cause

We're still young and in love
And we just believe
We can be strong and do anything
If we dare to dream

We'll find a place on a cliff by the ocean
And pay a couple months?rent
I'll sell my paintings down by the boardwalk
So we'll have enough money to spend...

His roller coaster never stops

Jo Dee Messina,"Here goes another day
A hug and a kiss, we're on our way
A cup of coffee for the road
Baby I can't wait to get back home
We juggle all our hopes and dreams
With a million responsibilities
And now and then we drop the ball
We lean sometimes but we never fall

Look at me, look at you
Look at all that we've been through
With a lot of love and a little luck
So far it's been so good
Cross your fingers, knock on wood and pray
And if it helps I'll throw a dollar in the wishing well

It ain't always laughs and smiles
But the carousel just ain't our style
The roller coaster suits us fine
Boy the ups and downs livin' up the ride

Look at me, look at you
Look at all that we've been through
With a lot of love and a little luck
So far it's been so good
Cross your fingers, knock on wood and pray
  And if it helps I'll throw a dollar in the wishing well

Jo Dee Messina,"You can spread your wings and fly
You can try to go so High -- in the sky
That you'll never come down
You can follow every dream
But when it seems -- everything you believe
Never works out
Remember I'm right here for you
When everything comes undone
You belong to me
You belong in the sun
(let it shine, let it shine)
You can wander far away--
Everyday I will pray you're safe
Till I see you again
When you feel that no one cares
You're scared I'll be there this I swear
Right To the end
I'll always be right here for you 
No matter what you've done
You belong to me
You belong in the sun

They're gonna be blown away",You Belong in the Sun

I'd dance naked in the street
With a top hat full of money

I'd sip honey from a pickle jar
In the back of my limousine
They'd call me an icon
And I'd be lookin' back at you

And never have to pay the rent

Like an old pair of shoes, like a tattoo, sometimes like a scar

Who I am ain't no mystery
Where I've been has left a mark on me

Every day's a brand new page I can't wait to cut and paste

My smiling face, gives me away, yeah everybody knows

Well, you look around thinking
If they only knew
Well I do

[Chorus:]
I've felt the chill of this world cut down to the bone
I've walked many a mile down this road on my own
I've been through hell on my knees
Come face to face with the devil
And I know that it's hard to believe
But it gets better

Time is a healer, but we can't see how
When you're caught in the moment
And the hurting is now
We don't want to see that maybe somethings
Weren't meant to figure out

But I was wanting to climb in that Chevy when I saw what was sitting behind that 
wheel

[Chorus]
Mornin' sun found a new mustang
Abandoned in a Walmart parking lot
Mud on the seats so don't tell me away
Didn't stop the gossip tongues from waggin'
'Til next day somewhere around three o'clock
No tellin' what they're talkin about
What's going 'round
It's too late to worry about that now
Where do men so big and bad learn all them words so sweet and soft
It made my world spin 'round so fast I thought it was gonna sling me off
Red mud on the finders might have gave a clue as to where we'd been
And no one knows just what went on except the moon, me and him

I used to think that life was all about the joneses
Trying to find a way to just keep up some how
I had to have it, do it, be it, had to own it
A little secret that I finally figured out
We spend so much time climbing up the ladder
And then we're missing all the things that really matter

[Chorus:]
I've got my two feet on the ground
Breathin' in and breathin' out
Oh yeah
Life is good
I'm gonna grab on to today
Live every minute in the way I know I should
Life is good
I like to move, I like to run, I like to get it done
Or I can stay home on the couch and watch tv

Why I wanna scream it's just not fair
Pray to god I didn't care
I wanna turn back time
Turn back time and have you here with me
I want to find someone to blame
But sometimes life gets in the way
And it doesn't care how much we love
Cause sometimes love is just not enough

Oh we took a chance we gave it all we had and couldn't make it
It didn't work for all the times we tried
No matter how we loved, it seemed the odds were stacked against us
Now we have to live our separate lives

More bills to pay than a corporation

An easy day, some appreciation
Hey how 'bout a friend?

I gotta face my reflection and say
Hey, hey

Been stuck under water
Strung up on the wire and still the world goes around

Been tossed like a free throw
Knocked out when the wind blows

Highway that leads 
To a true freedom

I close my eyes and it's all right
The sun will shine on a new horizon
Just around the bend

So I can face my reflection and say

Where were you when the walls started caving in
I was waiting for someone to save me
When I was coming unglued

Jo Hamilton,"When I was a child my family would travel
Down to Western Kentucky where my parents were born
And there's a backwards old town that's often remembered
So many times that my memories are worn


And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away
Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Airdrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill

Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man

When I die let my ashes float down the Green River
Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester dam
I'll be halfway to Heaven with Paradise waitin'

To grant whatever you would crave,
I have both wagered life and land,
Your love and good-will for to have.


[Chorus]


If you intend thus to disdain,
It does the more enrapture me,
And even so, I still remain
A lover in captivity.


[Chorus]


My men were clothed all in green,
And they did ever wait on thee;
All this was gallant to be seen,
And yet thou wouldst not love me.


[Chorus]


Thou couldst desire no earthly thing,
but still thou hadst it readily.
Thy music still to play and sing;
And yet thou wouldst not love me.


[Chorus]


Well, I will pray to God on high,
that thou my constancy mayst see,
And that yet once before I die,
Thou wilt vouchsafe to love me.

Ah, Greensleeves, now farewell, adieu,
To God I pray to prosper thee,
For I am still thy lover true,
Come once again and love me.

For Machine Gun, took the poor boy away.

Jo Stafford,"All in the merry month of May
When the green buds they were swelling,
William Green on his death-bed lay
For the love of Barbara Allen.

He sent his servant to the town
To the place where she was dwelling
Saying ""Love, there is a call for you 
If your name is Barbara Allen.""

She was very slowly getting up
And very slowly going, 
The only words she said to him
Were ""Young man I think you're dying.""

""Don't you remember the other day
When you were in town a-drinking,
You drank a health to the ladies all around
And slighted Barbara Allen?""

""O yes, I remember the other day
When I was in town a-drinking,
I drank a health to the ladies all around,
But my love to Barbara Allen.""

He turned his pale face to the wall
And death was in him dwelling;
""Adieu, adieu, to my friends all,
Be kind to Barbara Allen.""

When she got in two miles of town
She heard the death bells ringing:
They rang so clear, as if to say 
""Hard-hearted Barbara Allen!""

So she looked east and she looked west
And saw the cold corpse coming,
She says ""Come round you nice young man
And let me look upon you.""

The more she looked the more she grieved
Until she burst out crying
""Perhaps I could have saved that young man's life
Who now is here a-lying.""

""O Mother, O Mother, come make my bed
O make it both soft and narrow,
For sweet William died to-day 
And I will die to-morrow.""

""O Father, O Father, come dig my grave
O dig it deep and narrow,
For sweet William died in love
And I will die in sorrow.""

Sweet William was buried in the old church tomb,
Barbara Allen was buried in the yard;
Out of William's heart grew a red rose,
Out of Barbara Allen's grew a brier.

They grew and grew to the old church tower
And they could not grow any higher;
And at the end tied a true lover's knot
And the rose wrapped around the brier.",Barbara Allen
Jo Stafford,"I once had a gown, it was almost new
Oh, the daintiest thing, it was sweet Alice blue
With little forget-me-nots placed here and there
When I had it on, I walked on the air
And it wore, and it wore, and it wore
'Til it went, and it wasn't no more

In my sweet little Alice blue gown
When I first wandered down into town
I was both proud and shy, as I felt every eye
And in every shop window I primped passing by
Then in manner of fashion, I'd frown
And the world seemed to smile all around
'Til it wilted, I wore it, I'll always adore it
My sweet little Alice blue gown

The little silk worms that made silk for that gown
Just made that much silk and then crawled in the ground
For there never was anything like it before
And I don't dare to hope there will be any more
But it's gone, 'cause it just had to be
Still it wears in my memory

In my sweet little Alice blue gown
When I first wandered down into town
I was both proud and so shy, as I felt every eye
And in every shop window I primped passing by

Jo Stafford,"I'll begin the story
Out in West Virginia
Is a little college

Only cared for football
Never mind the knowledge

Never mind the sheepskin
They preferred the pigskin
Seemed to have it in their bones

Couldn't do without it

And he played the clarinet with all his might
He studied night and day, he practiced day and night

Even though his buddies

Always cut their studies
To attend the rallies

While they all were rootin'

You could hear him tootin'
""What's become of Sally""
(Rah, Rah, Rah)
How they used to hate him

Co-eds wouldn't date him
Thought he was an awful bore
Oh, but he liked his rhythm
More than being with `em

So he'd only turn in
For to practice some more
And meanwhile the team marched on to greater fame
Till they were asked to play that famous Rose Bowl game

And on that day of days the students beamed
What did they do when the team marched on the scene
I want to tell you ladies and you gentlemen, they screamed.

They pulled every trick off

But they couldn't win it
(No, no, no)
Instead of goin' forwards
They were goin' backwards

`Bout a mile a minute
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Seein' their position
They called intermission

And they heard the referee say
Hey, seventeen to nothin'
Ain't exactly nothin'
And you've only got about a minute to play

And then from the stand there came a distant wail
And it was Jamboree a-swingin' ""Hold `em Yale""
(Bula, bula, bula)
And then the students all began to yell

The players marched up the field
And down the field, pell mell.
Now on a certain West Virginia hill

There's a story that a padre tells,
Of a gay senor and senorita,
And the serenade of the bells.
Seems they asked the padre for permission
To be married early in the spring,
But their folks had made just one condition
That the mission bells had to ring.
Ev'ry one knew the bells were broken,
And hadn't sounded for a long, long time.
Then one night the village was astounded
For the bells began to chime!
Still the bells are broken, goes the story
But if in your heart a true love dwells
They will ring for you in all their glory,
That's the serenade of the bells.",Serenade of the Bells

Tumbleweeds around me sing their lonely song.
Nights underneath the prairie moon,
I ride along and sing this tune.

See them tumbling down
Pledging their love to the ground
Lonely but free I'll be found
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds.

Cares of the past are behind
Nowhere to go but I'll find
Just where the trail will wind
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds.

I know when night has gone
That a new world's born at dawn.

I'll keep rolling along
Deep in my heart is a song
Here on the range I belong

From out of the past, where forgotten things belong,
You keep coming back like a song.

Jo Stafford,"T'was the night before Christmas and all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care
In the hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there 

The children were nestled all snug in their beds
While visions of sugar plums danced in their heads.
Mom in her kerchief and I in my cap
Had just settled down for a long winter's nap. 

When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter
I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter
Away to the window I flew with a flash
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash 

The moon on the breast of the new fallen snow
Gave a luster of mid-day to objects below.
When what to my wondering eyes should appear
But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer 

With a little old driver so lively and quick
Well I knew in a moment, it must be St. Nick
More rapid than eagles, his coursers they came
And he whistled and he shouted and he called them by name 

""On Dasher, on Dancer, on Prancer and Vixen
On Comet, on Cupid, on Donner and Blitzen!
To the top of the porch, to the top of the wall
Now, dash away, dash away, dash away all!"" 

As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly
When they meet to an obstacle mount to the sky
So up to the rooftop the coursers they flew
With a sleigh full of toys and St. Nicholas too. 

And then in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing, the pawing of each little hoof
As I drew in my head and was turning around
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound 

He was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back
And he looked like a peddler just op'ning his pack 

His eyes, how they twinkled, his dimples, how merry
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry
His droll little mouth was drawn up in a bow
And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow 

The stump of a pipe, he held tight in his teeth
And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath
He had a broad face and a little round belly
That shook when laughed (ho, ho, ho, ho) like a bowl full of jelly 
(ho, ho, ho, ho) 

He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf
And I laughed when I saw him in spite of myself
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread 

He spoke not a word but went straight to his work
And filled all the stockings and turned with a jerk
And laying a finger to the side of his nose
And giving a nod up the chimney he rose 

He sprang to his sleigh, and to his team gave a whistle
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle
But I heard him exclaim as he drove out of sight
""Merry Christmas to all and to all..goodnight 

Goodnight.""",'Twas the Night Before Christmas

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow

For I'm always so alone till the day draws to an end;
But when the sun goes down and the moon comes through,
To the monotone of the evening's drone I'm all alone with you.

All through the night,
I delight in your love,
All through the night you're so close to me!
All through the night,
From a height far above,
You and your love brings me ecstasy!

O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him,

On a one-horse open sleigh,
Over the fields we go,

Bells on bob-tail ring,
making spirits bright,

jingle all the way!

I thought I'd take a ride,
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;

Misfortune seemed his lot;
He got into a drifted bank,
And we, we got upsot.

the story I must tell

And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there
I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

Jo Stafford,"I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be

Jo Stafford,"Once I was young, yesterday, perhaps
Danced with Jim and Paul and kissed some other chaps
Once I was young, but never was naive
I thought I had a trick or two up my imaginary sleeve
And now I know I was naive

I didn't know what time it was
Then I met you
Oh, what a lovely time it was
How sublime it was too!

I didn't know what day it was
Then you held my hand
Warm like the month of May it was
And I'll say it was grand

Grand to be alive, to be young
To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch
Hear your voice say I'm all your own

I didn't know what year it was
Life was no prize
I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes

Once I was old, twenty years or so
Rather well preserved, the wrinkles didn't show
Once I was old, but not too old for fun
I used to hunt for little girls up my imaginary gun
But now I ain't for only one

And yet you're easy on the eyes

You weave a magic spell

For summer is dying,
They know that in my heart
There's no gladness
Because there's no you,

The garden we talked in,
How lonesome they seem in the fall,
The stormy clouds hover,
And falling leaves cover

In spring we'll meet again,
We'll kiss and recapture
The summertime rapture we knew,
And from that day,
Never more will I say there's no you",There's No You

The emblem of suffering and shame;

Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
To bear it to dark Calvary.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see,
For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,
To pardon and sanctify me.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

To the old rugged cross I will ever be true;
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away,
Where His glory forever I'll share.

Till my trophies at last I lay down;

Jo Stafford,"I'll begin the story
Out in West Virginia
Is a little college
(Rah, Rah, Rah)

All the student body
Only cared for football
Never mind the knowledge
(Rah, Rah, Rah)

Never mind the sheepskin
They preferred the pigskin
Seemed to have it in their bones
Yeah, they knew all about it

Couldn't do without it
All except a certain Mr. Jamboree Jones
And he played the clarinet with all his might
He studied night and day, he practiced day and night

No runnin' up the field for Mr. Jones
He'd rather run up the scale and down the scale,
What tones.
Even though his buddies

Always cut their studies
To attend the rallies
(Rah, Rah, Rah)
While they all were rootin'

You could hear him tootin'
""What's become of Sally""
(Rah, Rah, Rah)
How they used to hate him

Co-eds wouldn't date him
Thought he was an awful bore
Oh, but he liked his rhythm
More than being with `em

So he'd only turn in
For to practice some more
And meanwhile the team marched on to greater fame
Till they were asked to play that famous Rose Bowl game

And on that day of days the students beamed
What did they do when the team marched on the scene
I want to tell you ladies and you gentlemen, they screamed.
Rah, Rah, Rah, Rah

Biff-boom-bah, bah-bah-dee-addle-oh
Yea-ho, watch `em go
Startin' from the kick-off,
They pulled every trick off

But they couldn't win it
(No, no, no)
Instead of goin' forwards
They were goin' backwards

`Bout a mile a minute
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Seein' their position
They called intermission

And they heard the referee say
Hey, seventeen to nothin'
Ain't exactly nothin'
And you've only got about a minute to play

And then from the stand there came a distant wail
And it was Jamboree a-swingin' ""Hold `em Yale""
(Bula, bula, bula)
And then the students all began to yell

The players marched up the field
And down the field, pell mell.
Now on a certain West Virginia hill
There stands that college still

Just as it always will
And there's a picture in the hall of fame
You'll find the boy in the frame who won the game
Jamboree Jones was the gentleman's name.",Jamboree Jones
Jo Stafford,"It was written in the stars
What was written in the stars shall be

That the heart and not the eyes shall see
 
And so whether it bring joy
Whether it bring woe

Now suddenly I know
You are the one
 
Here as in a daydream
By my side you stand
Here with my tomorrows
In your hands

Hows about cooking something up for me

Don't move a finger for one kiss
You can take all my pretty moonlight
That's money to me
Take charge of my reasoning
Hold on
Take a hold of me
Make the body beautiful
A huge old barrel
Rust my car if you must
Just don't go giving too much of yourself
To everyone
I swear
Turn my body into dust
Just show me a clean face
Clean as can be
Either keep your hands to yourself
Or stretch out and give them to me
Need much more from you
Than twenty four hours
So much I don't have to rush
Just don't go promoting yourself to everybody
I'll sell my soul for your trust
There's so much that I want to do
All I need is time
No cost to you if you just go 'bout
Your business
And leave me alone to unwind
For a long time",Body to Dust
Joan Armatrading,"So I've been sad
So I'm confused
Like most people are at times
But I love you
And this love of mine
Will comfort you
If need be
I am your friend
At times when I'm worried
I'll shy away from you

So at times I'm without the light I need in life
But I love you and this love of mine
Will open many doors
To make you see me to make you see me
See me in loves light

Come when you need me
I'm needing you
We could be the starlight in the morning dew
Even in my sorrows
I'll smile for you
Makes me free to see you happy

So I turn away at times
Turn away from right and wrong
So I freeze in the breeze
In the breeze of your song

But I love you
And this love of mine will
See you through
Giving to us the morning dew



",Come When You Need Me
Joan Armatrading,"I wanted to contact Jesus
'Cause of the million and one ways

If it's too late for love
I won't take hand-outs
From you

Just give me wings of doves
Make my mind blank
Set my heart free
Mind that's blank

And a heart that's free
Not a line not a song
To remind me
How come there's kisses at the bottom

When you need
When you need
And no time when your liner
Drifts in

Silver and shining
You broke my heart
Let me tell you I'm hurt
But you know that

I'm too down to cry
I won't cry
I'll turn to Jesus
I'll turn to Jesus
I'll talk to him

And he can help me to help me
Somebody help me
Help me get in touch with the man
Who can help me dream again

Kissing late at night
That's what I wanna do
With my little baby
All right

See me take that love
And hold it tight
Watch me hold on tight

Just as in the day time
Get my smile
Candles round the table
In the pale moonlight

Blackcurrent and jelly jars
Can't hold the sweetness
Sugar itself
So nice
Been said before but I feel it's right

And when I'm waddling old
Still wanna be there
High and mighty Oo
Old but gold
Love is you
So good

I'm a hopping onto a passing cloud
I'm sailing off to a heaven

Then I thought of your touch 

And that reminds me of your kiss

Arms around each others shoulders we go everywhere

Second to none
Not even on a bad night

With me hugged up inside
I wanna see you fan the fire

And don't run for cover

Cozy corner your arms around you
So tired of one night stands
Left with longing from misspent passion
With one more human to despise

You've got somebody who loves you
Don't mine for gold in the dim lit cafes
And as the gypsy once foretold
Love is dark but no stranger
Mistaken shyness can be costly
Too hasty a goodbye
Then you've lost me
You've got somebody who loves you

And don't run for cover

Too hasty a goodbye

And he said he loved me so
Walked me to my door
Before I knew it to my living room

I thought there was no need for worry
When he took me in his arms
Drank some whisky
Hung his coat upon the stand

That's when the music started
I heard the light switch click
I stumbled on a lost shoe
The fever's starting
This man was getting hot
I got no strength to make him stop
I guess it's too late
But I'll know next time
To mix some water with the wine

The sun came pouring in at
Five upon my face
I felt the taste of last night's love
Upon my lips
I wasn't sure if I had dreampt it
Or had not
But there across the pillow
Was the face I had forgot

That's when he said he loved me
Could be the truth this time
He put his arms about me

His shoes
Finest leather
He said

With numbers on the back
And an L-shaped

Wide opened
And the knowledge in my head

Carried my credentials

With a pretty person, my arm when someone started shouting
They were hooting and a hollering
They were saying, ""I should never have been born""

I said, ""Baby, you hear that?""
You're listening to the voices of fools
I said, ""Baby, let me tell you""

What they're trying to do
They're trying to make our love
A thing of the past but I said, ""Aha""

The very next day it was early in the morning
The sun was shining on my back
I was feeling pretty rested, the air smelt good
And I forgot about the thing in the park

When they walked up then they passed me
You know, I didn't want to turn my head
But they started up again and those silly voices rang
And the clanging was too much for my brain

But I said, ""Aha, what we've got is the best""

It was Friday, I had money, I was feeling kind of special
I was taking my baby, up town
The moon was high, the stars were bright
And there was lots of people in the street

I held your hand, you kissed me and then
All the people started to stare, we started a commotion
Someone making comments, morals
The state of affairs and I said, ""What we got is the best""

If fell between the covers and my bare skin
It fell between my crying

This one much too much
Sometimes I gave just enough of myself
But most times nothing at all

And you've been gone too long
You know I love you the best
You call me crazy, that's how you won my heart
'Cause you were half crazy too

I read your letter again today
Out loud and to myself
It gave me back my sanity
I didn't feel so alone

Won't be too soon
Not like the night
Not like the night on a summer's day

Joan Armatrading,"Told me that you loved me
You've been looking for me all your life
Told you I was married

I can't wait to kiss you on the mouth
I can't contain this yearning
And I can't seem to put the fire out

Only to be polite
It's late, I started leaving

Would melt a tyrant's heart

And I'll see you later sweetheart

Day had begun
I heard your soft voice crying
Told me you were wrong
In time I'd learn to love you
And you had time to spare
And you called again tomorrow
And the next day

The midday flight was on time
No time to hesitate
I changed and unchanged my mind
But this one had to stay

I knew that if we started
I'd be lost and so would you
Though we both regret our parting
We are bound to see it through

I still see your face before me
And smell the scent you wore
And hear your soft voice crying

I thought mercy mama
Don't let him get me

And as I turned my head I knew right then
I was gonna have to do it again

And I was singing
Mercy, mercy mama
Don't you dare let it get me
I love the one I love
And if I stray it's gonna hurt

I was drinking beer with a close friend
When I saw you walking in the room, I thought
Mercy me I can't keep a running
You're gonna get me, oh

As wrong as this is you touched me
Of course you had me hooked
And as I kissed your lips I knew right then
I was gonna have to do it again

Making out I was sincere I thought
Mercy me I can't keep a lying

As long as you stay with me
Forget the whole affair
I promise you I'll be true

And I can't keep on lying
'Cause one day, I'll find
I'm not your hero

It's so nice that someone thinks
You're special, treat them right
That trust in you is precious
All the same, we make mistakes

I've used up a few lives
Now I'm afraid of dying

You're not forgiving

And make someone else some kind of an unknowin' fool

And pretend to be just passing by?

But this new love cuts deep

I'm longing for the calm
I'm heading for the pastures
I can see on your dry land
Let the sea that once did take me
Bring me back safe to your door

Clear the deck let me touch your soul

You came by
I was so glad though sadness covered
The smile I kept for you
I was waiting for the cloud to pass over
Then I could show my love

You could have made me laugh if you'd stayed
But you left
I was more confused than I was before you came
I was frightened
I saw insanity and tears
I shouted for you to stay

It could have been better
If you had held my hand
And smiled at me
Or questioned why
My face was so distorted

I'm back in the sunlight again
Oh I'm so glad
It's only joy I wanna give to you
Sometimes I feel lost and desperate
Please forgive me

Or consideration

I've got to get myself back 
Move so far from you 
And you so true 
Well let me get myself back 
Never going to wander again 
Travel so far 
Well let me get myself back

Was seeing the old moon 
Walking past the door 
He had freedom eyes 
His home was the skies 
And he beckoned me to his side 
He said come let's go, let's go 
Freedom road 
Just you and me 
Bring the sun 
If you feel you need some warm company

Travel so far 
Well let me get myself back 
Move so close to you 
And you're still true 
It's good to have you smile back 
Get back get back get back 
I'll let you lead the way 
Never going to wander again

Don't say 
You've stopped loving me 
'Cos there by your side 
Should be no one but me 
Don't say you've stopped loving me 
'Cos there by your side 
I've traveled so far to be 
Get back get back get back

Was feeling how your body moved 
Watching the leaves blow in the trees 
Then I thought of your touch 
And that reminds me of your kiss 
And I almost drove myself insane 
Don't say you've stopped loving me 
Think up as I go how you're gonna 
Outshine the sun and moon 
Don't say you've stopped loving me 
'Cos there by your side 
Should be no one but me 
Should be no one but me",Travelled So Far
Joan Armatrading,"Do boys dream about
Living in a constant ecstasy
Do boys dream about
The same kind of things
That young girls dream

What do the boys dream
What do the boys all dream of

Do boys dream about
Life in space and hallucination
Do boys dream about
The killing of a friend
The investigation

What do the boys dream
What do the boys all dream of

Do boys dream about
The great escape of the mythical monsters
Do boys dream about
The big romance
With the girl of their dreams

Joan Armatrading,"Life is hard
Work is dirty
Friends plead poverty
Fame and fortune
Keeps it's own time
So don't wait up

But if you can feel the sun
If you can feel the rain
Life can't be bad
If you've got food to eat
And all your dreams to dream
Life can't be bad
If you can walk away
And fight another day
Life can't be that bad

For all the things that I can do
How could I complain
I've got no broken wings
I've got a heart that sings
And I feel blessed",Blessed

Tears fill the back of your eyes
These are the times
The birds migrate
Across the skies

These are the times
What hope you had you forget
These wicked times
You're bound to feel
All sanity is lost

In these times everyone needs love
In these times do you pray to God
In these times everyone needs comfort
And would welcome a hand to hold
Compassion is the fire
That burns the hurt
That pains the soul
And though my eyes are so polluted
By the sight of lost desires
I can see you standing by

This is my fear
That distance will come between us
And it could mean nothing
Nothing
To get from here to there
We own the world
And everything that's in it
Let our love shine
Like glistening raindrops
Resting on a rose

In these times celebrate our love
In these times let's be thankful of
All the days we can spend together
And I'm happy to hold your hand
Your passion is the food
That feeds the hunger in my heart
And now my eyes are clearly open
No more longing for the past
Now I have you in these times

Joan Armatrading,"Once in a while
We share a thought
But most of all we drift apart
Haven't you noticed
We seem less happy more often

And I don't know what to do
Whether to be with you
And I'm as sure as sure
I can't live without you
So what is to become of us
How do we get it back
I'm as certain as you
That I don't like it

When we embrace
The thrill is gone
But in reality we hardly touch at all
Haven't you noticed
We get more lonely
More often

And I don't know what to do
Whether to be with you
And I'm as sure as sure I'm sure
I can't live without you

Where do we go from here
I'm as upset as you
At how our love has gone

When we began
We shared a dream
And all our strength was in our unity
Haven't you noticed we seem less mighty
More helpless

I don't know what to do
I can't put the blame on you
But I can't blame myself

Could dull their senses

Yea don't touch the ground these days what's going on 
Yea you think I'm stupid cos I don't complain
Better sit your self down start talking fast
And if the lying don't kill you
The truth just might make you fade away
Fade away
Fade away",D.N.A.

Mama papa told us
Play hard
Fight fair

And love the Lord
I said love the Lord
Said love the Lord

The United Kingdom living in Birmingham
When they wanted to spread their wings and fly away

No heat
One wage
And bills to pay
I said bills to pay
Gotta pay those bills

Now when you're walking on heaven's floor
Talking in the ear of God
What you gonna say to the man 
When he asks you what you've done

Can you say you did your very best 
With what you had
Like my mama and my papa

I know two people who served up love
And a whole lot more
They made us hold our sides with laughter all night long
Oh they made us laugh
Until we cried
Till we begged them stop

Joan Armatrading,"They're singing secular songs in the churches
And there's not a of word of God
It's all Schubert and Beethoven
Oh and lots of French love songs
So let's go down on Sunday morning
To hear that Jacob sermon read
Everybody dressed in their finest church apparel baby
Listening to the preacher eulogies

Then we'll pray
Pray
Pray
Yea we'll pray
Our souls will rise upon that day
Pray
Pray
Pray
Pray we change to better ways

They're telling stories about love's passion
All about ménage a trois
Hear those heart felt Lieder 
Coming from that deep bass voice
And whilst some sleep though this music
Others weep for all the pain
As they sing secular song in the churches baby
It's time to kneel let's kneel and pray


Yea we'll pray
Pray
Pray
Pray
Our souls will rise upon that day
Hallelujah

Joan Armatrading,"Smell of a man
Smell of musk
The noise of the train
From morning till dusk
The up escalator broken down
The clothes on my back
Look like they were taken out of the laundry basket
To weary to wash
To weary to wash

Now there's hordes of people
Pushing and shoving
Sizzling noises coming out of their ears
Hold on to the strap
Or hold on to a stranger
Hope that stranger's day has not been too hard

Aggression builds up
When the going is slow
And you're packed like sardines

So I can pass on the left
Cos Something's gotta blow

Dodging the fare
Ain't worth the crime
Think of your loved ones 
Whilst you're doing your time
Being met at the station 
No better thrill
Than that 4x4 cruiser 
Coming over the hill
Bringing love and relief
From the noise and the heat
From the suicide jumpers
From that head nodding sleep

From the smell of burgers
And the rustling of sweets
Someone lend me your phone
So I can say which train to meet
Let me say which train to meet

When you work so hard
And the sweat pours down on you

As a friend

'Cause we never know
How much we can take
Before we break
The spell in our haunted house

I've never felt alone
Like I do now, this moment
I don't belong here at all
Must find the spark to go on

Little one 'cause I owe it to us
To tend the fire and fend off fear
The fear in me so near to me
It never goes so learn to let it in

Like the rain 'cause we never know
How much we can take
Before the storm breaks
The storm of our wild design

I've never felt this way
Or maybe I do everyday
What is this gift to be alive
Must find the spark, the spark to survive",To Survive

There's a calf with a mournful eye
High above him there's a swallow

And half the summer's night

CHORUS:
Well I'm a rake and ramblin' boy.
There's many a city I did enjoy,
And now I've married me a pretty little wife
And I love her dearer than I love my life.

Oh, she was pretty, both neat and gay
Caused me to rob the broad highway
Oh, yes, I robbed it, I do declare.
And I got myself ten thousand bail.

Chorus

Oh when I die don't bury me at all
Place my bones in alcohol
And at my feet place a snow white dove
To let the world know I died for love.

Well I'm a rake and a ramblin' boy.
There's many a city I did enjoy,
And now I've married me a pretty little wife
And I love her dearer than I love my life.
And I love her dearer than I love my life.

Joan Baez,"I will twine with my mingles of raven black hair
With the roses so red and the lilies so fair 
The meadow so bright with it's emerald hue
And the pale and the leader and eyes look so blue

I will dance, I will sing and my laugh shall be gay
I will charm every heart, in his crown I will sway 
I woke from my dream and all idols was clay
And all portions of love then had all flown away

He told me to love him and promised to love
And cherish me over all others above
My poor heart is wondering no misery can tell
He left me no warning, no words of farewell

He told me to love him and called me his flower
That was blooming to cheer him through life's weary hour 
How I long to see him and regret the dark hour
He's gone and neglected his frail wildwood flower.",Wildwood Flower

And leave you for a while

Well, I may lie, lament and cry
And you'll, you'll not hear my mourn
And you'll, no you'll

Oh, the crow that is so black, my love
Will change his color white
If ever I should prove false to thee

Yes the day, oh the day

Down beside where the waters flow,

Joan Baez,"Twas in the merry month of May 
When green buds all were swelling, 
Sweet William on his death bed lay 
For love of Barbara Allen.

He sent his servant to the town 
To the place where she was dwelling, 
Saying you must come, to my master dear 
If your name be Barbara Allen.
 
So slowly, slowly she got up 
And slowly she drew nigh him, 
And the only words to him did say 
Young man I think you're dying. 

He turned his face unto the wall 
And death was in him welling, 
Good-bye, good-bye, to my friends all 
Be good to Barbara Allen.

When he was dead and laid in grave 
She heard the death bells knelling 
And every stroke to her did say 
Hard hearted Barbara Allen. 

Oh mother, oh mother go dig my grave 
Make it both long and narrow, 
Sweet William died of love for me 
And I will die of sorrow.

And father, oh father, go dig my grave 
Make it both long and narrow, 
Sweet William died on yesterday 
And I will die tomorrow. 

Barbara Allen was buried in the old churchyard 
Sweet William was buried beside her, 
Out of sweet William's heart, there grew a rose 
Out of Barbara Allen's a briar. 

They grew and grew in the old churchyard 
Till they could grow no higher 
At the end they formed, a true lover's knot 
And the rose grew round the briar.",Barbara Allen
Joan Baez,"When Joseph was an old man, an old man was he
He married Virgin Mary, the Queen of Galilee
He married Virgin Mary, the Queen of Galilee

Joseph and Mary walked through an orchard green
There were cherries and berries, as thick as might be seen
There were cherries and berries, as thick as might be seen

Mary said to Joseph, so meek and so mild:
Joseph, gather me some cherries, for I am with child
Joseph, gather me some cherries, for I am with child

Then Joseph flew in anger, in anger flew he
Let the father of the baby gather cherries for thee!
Let the father of the baby gather cherries for thee!

Then up spoke baby Jesus, from in Mary's womb:
Bend down the tallest branches, that my mother might have some
Bend down the tallest branches, that my mother might have some

And bend down the tallest branches, it touched Mary's hand
Cried she: Oh look thou Joseph, I have cherries by command
Oh look thou Joseph, I have cherries by command

Joan Baez,"Along came the F15 the swiftest on the line 
Running o'er the C and O road just twenty minutes behind 
Running into Cevile head porters on the line 
Receiving their strict orders from a station just behind 
Georgie's mother came to him with a bucket on her arm 
Saying my darling son be careful how you run 

For many a man has lost his life in trying to make lost time 
And if you run your engine right you'll get there just on time 
Up the road he darted against the rocks he crushed 

Upside down the engine turned and Georgie's breast did smash 
His head was against the firebox door the flames are rolling high 
I'm glad I was born for an engineer to die on the C&O road 
The doctor said to Georgie my darling boy be still 

Your life may yet be saved if it is God's blessed will 
Oh no said George that will not do I want to die so free 
I want to die for the engine I love one hundred and forty three 

The doctor said to Georgie your life cannot be saved 
Murdered upon a railroad and laid in a lonesome grave 
His face was covered up with blood his eyes they could not see 
And the very last words poor Georgie said was nearer my God to thee",Engine 143
Joan Baez,"Lily of the West

Arrangement by Joan Baez

When first I came to Louisville
Some pleasure there to find
A damsel there from Lexington
Was pleasing to my mind
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips
Like arrows pierced my breast
And the name she bore was Flora
The Lily Of The West

I courted lovely Flora
Some pleasure there to find
She turned unto another man
Which sore distressed my mind
She robbed me of my liberty
Deprived me of my rest
Still I love my faithless Flora
The Lily Of The West

Down in yonder shady grove
A man of high degree
Conversing with my Flora there
It seemed so strange to me
And the answer that she gave to him
It sure did me oppress
I was betrayed by Flora
The Lily Of The West

I stepped up to my rival
My dagger in my hand
I seized him by the collar and
I boldly made him stand
Being mad to desperation I pierced him in the breast
All for my lovely Flora
The Lily Of The West

I had to stand my trial
I had to make my plea
They placed me in the criminal box
And then commenced on me
Although she swore my life away
Deprived me of my rest
And I still love my faithless Flora
The Lily Of The West



",Lily of the West
Joan Baez,"[Chorus]
Look up and down that lonesome road,
Hang down your head and cry, my Lord!
Hang down your head and cry

They say all good friends must part sometimes
Why not you and I (my Lord)
Why not you and I

I wish to the Lord that I've never been born,
Or died when I was a baby, my Lord!
Or died when I was a baby

I would've not been here eating this cold cold bread
And supping this salty gravy, my Lord!
And supping this salty gravy

I wish to the Lord that I've never seen your face,
Heard your lying tongue, my Lord!
Heard your lying tongue

So look up and down that lonesome road,
All our friends have gone, my Lord!
And you and I must go

Had an old dog and his name was Blue,
Had an old dog and his name was Blue,
Betcha five dollars he's a good dog too,
""Here old Blue""
""Good dog you""

Well, I shouldered my axe and I tooted my horn,
Went to find 'possum in the new-grown corn.
Old Blue treed and I went to see,
Blue had 'possum up a tall oak tree.
Boy I roasted 'possum, nice and brown,
Sweet potatoes, n' all a-round
And to say ""Here old Blue (here-boy)
You can have some too""

Now, Old Blue died and he died so hard,
Made a big dent in my back-yard.
Dug his grave with a silver spade,
Lowered him down with a link of chain.
Every link I did call his name
Singing ""Here old, Blue-ue
""Good dog you""

Now, when I get to heaven, first thing I'll do.
When I get to heaven, first thing 'awm do.
When I get to heaven first thing I'll do,
Pull out my horn and call old Blue,

""Good dog you.""

Joan Baez,"Trees, they grow high and the leaves they do grow green
Many is the time my true love I've seen
Many an hour I have watched him all alone
He's young but he's daily growing

Father, dear, father you've done me great wrong
You've married me to a boy who is too young
I'm twice twelve and he is but fourteen
He's young but he's daily growing

Daughter, dear daughter, I've done you no wrong
I have married you to a great lord's son
He'll make a lord for you to wait upon
He's young but he's daily growing

Father, dear father, if you see fit
We'll send him to college for one year yet
I'll tie blue ribbons all around his head
To let the maidens know that he's married

One day, I was looking o'er my father's castle wall
I spied all the boys aplaying with the ball
My own true love was the flower of them all
He's young but he's daily growing

At the age of fourteen, he was a married man
At the age of fifteen, the father of a son
At the age of sixteen, his grave it was green
And death had put an end to his growing

Controlled by her parents until she's a wife
A slave to her husband the rest of her life

Oh, I'm just a poor girl my fortune is sad
I've always been courted by the wagoner's lad
He's courted me daily, by night and by day
But now he is packing and moving away

My parents don't like him because he is poor
They say he's not worthy of entering my door
He works for a living, his money's his own
And if they don't like it they can leave him alone

Your horses are hungry, go feed them some hay
Then sit down beside me as long as you may
My horses ain't hungry, they won't eat your hay
Then fare thee well darlin I'll be on my way

Your wagon needs greasing your whip is to mend
Then sit down beside me as long as you can
My wagon is greasy, my whip's in my hand
Then fare thee well darlin, no longer to stand

Joan Baez,"If you'll gather 'round me children
A story I will tell
Of Pretty Boy Floyd an outlaw
Oklahoma knew him well.
It was in the town of Shawnee
It was Saturday afternoon
His wife beside him in his wagon
As into town they rode.
There a deputy sheriff approached him
In a manner rather rude
Using vulgar words of language
And his wife she overheard.
Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain
And the deputy grabbed a gun
And in the fight that followed
He laid that deputy down.

He took to the trees and timbers
And he lived a life of shame
Every crime in Oklahoma was added to his name
Yes, he took to the trees and timbers
On that Canadian River's shore
And Pretty Boy found a welcome
At a many a farmer's door.

There's a many a starving farmer
The same old story told
How this outlaw paid their mortgage
And saved their little home.
Others tell you 'bout a stranger
That come to beg a meal
And underneath his napkin
Left a thousand dollar bill.

It was in Oklahoma City
It was on a Christmas Day
There come a whole car load of groceries
With a letter that did say:
You say that I'm an outlaw
You say that I'm a thief
Here's a Christmas dinner
For the families on relief.

Now as through this world I ramble
I see lots of funny men
Some will rob you with a Six gun
And some with a fountain pen.
But as through your life you travel
As through your life you roam
You won't never see an outlaw
Drive a family from their home.",Pretty Boy Floyd

And among the dead and dying

Where you been don't bother me nor bring me down in sorrow
It don't even matter who you're waking with tomorrow

I am not asking you to say words like yes or no
Please understand me, I'm not calling for you to go
I'm just breathing to myself, pretending not that I don't know
That daddy, you been on my mind

When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror

I'll sing you the law of the Ranger's command.

To hold a six-shooter and never to run
As long as there's bullets in both of your guns.

I met a fair maiden whose name I don't know
I asked her to the round-up with me would she go.

She said she'd go with me to the cold round-up
And drink that hard liquor from a cold bitter cup.

We started for the round-up in the fall of the year
Expecting to get there with a herd of fat steer.

When the rustlers broke on us in the dead hour of night
She rose from her warm bed a battle to fight.
She rose from her warm bed with a gun in each hand
Saying, ""Come all you cowboys, and fight for your land.""

Come all of you cowboys, and don't ever run
As long as there's bullets in both of your guns.

How Jesus the Saviour did come for to die
For poor on'ry people like you and like I;
I wonder as I wander out under the sky 
When Mary birthed Jesus 'twas in a cow's stall
With wise men and farmers and shepherds and all
But high from God's heaven, a star's light did fall
And the promise of ages it then did recall. 
If Jesus had wanted for any wee thing
A star in the sky or a bird on the wing
Or all of God's Angels in heaven to sing
He surely could have it, 'cause he was the King",I Wonder as I Wander
Joan Baez,"Oh, come, oh, come, Emmanuel,
And ransom captive Israel,
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appear.
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to you, O Israel!

Oh, come, our Wisdom from on high,
Who ordered all things mightily,
To us the path of knowledge show,
And teach us in her ways to go.
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to you, O Israel!

Oh, come, oh, come, our Lord of might,
Who to your tribes on Sinai's height
In ancient times gave holy law,
In cloud and majesty and awe.
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to you, O Israel!

Oh, come O Rod of Jesse's stem,
From ev'ry foe deliver them
That trust your mighty pow'are to save,
Bring them in vict'ry through the grave.
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to you, O Israel!

Oh, come, O Key of David, come,
And open wide our heav'nly home,
Make safe the way that leads on high,
And close the path to misery.
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to you, O Israel!

Oh, come, our Dayspring from on high,
And cheer us by your drawing nigh,
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night,
And death's dark shadows put to flight.
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to you, O Israel!

Oh, come, Desire of nations, bind
In one the hearts of all mankind,
Oh, bid our sad divisions cease,
And be yourself our King of Peace.

Joan Baez,"What child is this, who, laid to rest
On Mary's lap, is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,
While shepherds watch are keeping?
This, this is Christ the King,
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
Haste, haste to bring him laud,
The Babe, the Son of Mary!

So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh,
Come peasant king to own Him,
The King of kings, salvation brings,
Let loving hearts enthrone Him.
Raise, raise the song on high,
The Virgin sings her lullaby:
Joy, joy, for Christ is born,
The Babe, the Son of Mary!",Silent Night

",What Child Is This?
Joan Baez,"It was many and many a year ago,
In a kingdom by the sea,
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
By the name of Annabel Lee,
And this maiden she lived with no other thought
Than to love and be loved by me.

I was a child and she was a child,
In this kingdom by the sea,
But we loved with a love that was more than love,
I and my Annabel Lee,
With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
Coveted her and me.

And this was the reason that,long ago,
In this kingdom by the sea,
A wind blew out of a cloud,chilling
My Annabel lee,
So that her high,born kinsmen came
And bore her away from me,
To shut her up in a sepulcher
In this kingdom by the sea.

And the angels,not half so happy in heaven,
Went envying her and me,
Yes!,that was the reason(as all men know,
In this kingdom by the sea)
That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
Chilling my Annabel lee,
That the wind came out of the cloud by night
Killing my Annabelle.

But our love it was stronger by far than the love
Of those who were older than we,
Of many far wiser than we,
And neither the angels in heaven above
Nor the the demons down under the sea,
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee, and the moon never beams,
Without bringing me dreams
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee,
And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee,
And so,all the night, tide, I lie down by the side
Of my darling my life and my bride,
In the sepulcher there by the sea,
In her tomb by the sounding sea.",Annabel Lee
Joan Baez,"Why all these bugles cry
These squads of young men drill
To kill and to be killed
Stood waiting by the train

Why the orders loud and hoarse
Why the engine's groaning cough
As it strains to drag us all
Into the holocaust

Why crowds who sing and cry
And shout and fling us flowers
And trade their rights for ours
To murder and to die

[Chorus]
The dove has torn her wing(s)
So no more songs of love
We are not here to sing
We're here to kill the dove

Why must this moment come
When childhood has to die
When hope shrinks to a sigh
And speech into a drum

Why are they pale and still
Young boys trained over night
Conscripts payed to kill
And dressed in gray to fight

These rainclouds massing tight
This train load battle bound
This moving burial ground
Goes thundering to the night

[Chorus]

Why statues towering grave
Above the last defeat
Old words and lies repeat
Across a new made grave

And why the same still birds
That victory always brought
These hours of glory bought
By men with mounds of earth

Dead ash without a spark
Where cities used to be
Where guns probe every spark
And crush it into dust

[Chorus]

And while your face undone
With jagged lines of tears
That gave in those first years
All the peace I'd ever want

Your body in the gloom
The platform fading back
Your shadow on the track
A flower upon a tomb

And why these days ahead
When I must let you cry
And live prepared to die
And to

Joan Baez,"If you were a carpenter, and I were a lady
Would you marry me anyway? would you have my baby?
If a tinker were your trade, would you still find me
Carrying the pots you made, following behind me?

See my love through loneliness
See my love for sorrow
I've given you my onlyness,
Come give me your tomorrow

If you worked your hands in wood, would you still love me?
Answer me, Yes I would, I'd put you above me""
And if you were a miller, had a mill-wheel grinding,
Would you see it written on my face? I'm here for the finding.

See my love through loneliness
See my love for sorrow
I've given you my onlyness,
Come give me your tomorrow

If you were a carpenter, and I were a lady
Would you marry me anyway? would you have my baby?
Would you marry me anyway? would you have my baby?



",If You Were a Carpenter
Joan Baez,"(Music by Joan Baez, Lyrics by Nina Duscheck)

Where icicles hung the blossoms swing,
But in my heart there is no spring.
You were my spring, my summer too,
It's always winter without you.

The flocks head north and the lilacs bloom,
At night they scent my moonlit room.
You were my spring, my summer too,
I'm going north to look for you.

Like a windblown bird my heart goes forth,
Sent by the spring to the shining north.
You are my spring, my summer too,
And I won't rest till I find you.

Joan Baez,"Farewell, my wistful Saigon bride 
I'm going out to stem the tide 
A tide that never saw the seas 
It flows through jungles, 'round the trees 
Some say it's yellow, some say red 
It will not matter when we're dead 

How many dead men will it take 
To build a dike that will not break? 
How many children must we kill 
Before we make the waves stand still? 
Though miracles come high today 
We have the wherewithal to pay 

It takes them off the streets, you know 
To places they would never go alone 
It gives them useful trades 
The lucky boys are even paid 
Men die to build their Pharaoh's tombs 
And still, and still the teeming wombs 

How many men to conquer Mars?
How many dead to reach the stars?
Farewell, my wistful Saigon bride 
I'm going out to stem the tide 
A tide that never saw the seas 
It flows through jungles, 'round the trees 
Some say it's yellow, some say red 
It will not matter when we're dead",Saigon Bride
Joan Baez,"With your mercury mouth in the missionary times,
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes,
And your silver cross, and your voice like chimes,
Oh, who among them do they think could bury you?
With your pockets well protected at last,
And your streetcar visions which you place on the grass,
And your flesh like silk, and your face like glass,
Who among them do they think could carry you?
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Should I put them by your gate,
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace,
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace,
And your basement clothes and your hollow face,
Who among them can think he could outguess you?
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
Into your eyes where the moonlight swims,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
Who among them would try to impress you?
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Should I leave them by your gate,
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?


The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug,
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew plugs,
Who among them do you think could resist you?
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Should I leave them by your gate,
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?


Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
To show you the dead angels that they used to hide.
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Oh, how could they ever mistake you?
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
But with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm,
And with the child of a hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
How could they ever, ever persuade you?
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Should I leave them by your gate,
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?


With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row,
And your magazine-husband who one day just had to go,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
Who among them do you think would employ you?
Now you stand with your thief, you're on his parole
With your holy medallion which your fingertips fold,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
Oh, who among them do you think could destroy you?
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Should I leave them by your gate,
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

Joan Baez,"All in green went my love riding
On a great horse of gold
Into the silver dawn.

Four lean hounds crouched low and smiling
The merry deer ran before.

Fleeter be they than dappled dreams
The swift sweet deer
The red rare deer.

Four red roebuck at a white water
The cruel bugle sang before.

Horn at hip went my love riding
Riding the echo down
Into the silver dawn.

Four lean hounds crouched low and smiling
The level meadows ran before.

Softer be they than slippered sleep
The lean lithe deer
The fleet flown deer.

Four fleet does at a gold valley
The famished arrow sang before.

Bow at belt went my love riding
Riding the mountain down
Into the silver dawn.

Four lean hounds crouched low and smiling
The sheer peaks ran before.

Paler be they than daunting death
The sleek slim deer
The tall tense deer.

Four tell stags at a green mountain
The lucky hunter sang before.

All in green went my love riding
On a great horse of gold
Into the silver dawn.

Four lean hounds crouched low and smiling
My heart fell dead before.",All in Green Went My Love Riding

Joan Baez,"I have shut my balcony
Because I do not want to hear the weeping
But from behind the great walls
Nothing else is heard but the weeping

There are very few angels that sing
There are very few dogs that bark
A thousand violins fit into the palm of my hand

But the weeping is an immense dog
The weeping is an immense angel
The weeping is an immense violin
The tears muzzle the wind
Nothing else is heard but the weeping

Joan Baez,"I want to sleep the dream of the apples
To withdraw from the tumult of cemeteries
I want to sleep the dream of that child
Who wanted to cut his heart on the high seas
I don't want to hear again that the dead do not lose their blood
That the putrid mouth goes on asking for water
I don't want to learn of the tortures of the grass
Nor of the moon with the serpent's mouth that labors before dawn

I want to sleep a while
A while, a minute, a century
But all must know that I have not died
That there is a stable of gold in my lips
That I am the small friend of the west wind
That I am the immense shadow of my tears

Cover me at dawn with a veil
Because dawn will throw fists full of ants at me
And wet with hard water my shoes
So that the pincers of the scorpion slide
For I want to sleep the dream of the apples
To learn a lament that will cleanse me of the earth
For I want to live with that dark child
Who wanted to cut his heart on the high seas",Gacela of the Dark Death
Joan Baez,"I saw the vision of armies;
And I saw, as in noiseless dreams, hundreds of battle-flags,
Borne through the smoke of the battles and pierced with missiles, I saw them,
And carried, hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and bloody
And at last but a few shreds of 'the flags left on the staffs, (and all in silence,) 
And the staffs all splintered and broken.

I saw battle-corpses, myriads of them, 
And the white skeletons of young men, I saw them
I saw the debris and debris of all dead soldiers, 
But I saw they were not as was thought

They themselves were fully at rest, they suffered not
The living remained and suffered, the mother suffered,
And the wife and the child and the musing comrade suffered,
And the armies that remained suffered..",I Saw the Vision of Armies
Joan Baez,"In Guernica the dead children were laid out in order on the sidewalk
In their white starched dresses
In their pitiful white dresses
On their foreheads and breasts the little round holes 

Where death came in as thunder

Do not weep for them, Madre
They are gone forever, the little ones
Straight to heaven to the saints
And God will fill the bullet holes with candy",In Guernica

Why should you roll us on from misery to misery, 
Giving us no place to stop in or take rest?

Now I lie on my bed and I see your sweet face.
The past I remember, time cannot erase.
The letters you wrote me were written in shame,
And I know that your conscience still echos my pain.

And the birds cease to sing when you rise
Ride easy your fairy stallion you have mounted

With my eyes, my ears, my heart strained to the full
I know I've tasted the essence in those few days

Joan Baez,"Oh, my, but you have a pretty face,
You favor a girl that I knew, 
I imagine that she´s still in Tennessee,
And, by God, I should be there, too
I´ve a sadness too sad to be true.
But I left Tennessee in a hurry, Dear,
The same way that I´m leaving you,
´Cause love is mainly just memories
And everyone´s got him a few,
So when I´m gone I´ll be glad to love you.

[Chorus]
At the brand new Tennessee Waltz you´re lit ´rally waltzing on air;
At the brand new Tennessee Waltz there ain´t no telling who will be there.

When I leave it´ll be like I found you, Love,
Descending Victorian stairs,
I´m feeling like one of your photographs
I´m trapped while I´m putting on airs,
And getting even by asking, ""Who cares"".
So, have all of your passionate violins
Play a tune for a Tennessee kid,
Who´s feeling like leaving another town
With no place to go if he did,
´Cause they´ll catch you wherever you hid.",The Brand New Tennessee Waltz
Joan Baez,"(Words and Music by Joan Baez)

The cats are sleeping here in the autumn sun.
Your dog has flushed a deer and he's on the run.
And the coffee cup is cold
And the morning's feeling very old.

Fifteen months of time my man's been gone.
The second winter now is coming on.
And our fates could all be worse
But sometimes I still must curse my own.

And hello
I wish you well
Where you sleep
All in your cell.

As for friends I can't complain, they've been good to me.
The fire's burning bright, they've left wood for me.
And the roof has been repaired.
And I thank them for the love they've shared.

You see, there's really nothing wrong, I've just got the blues.
Because if you give a damn you're going to pay some dues.
But if you see the game we're in
Like I do, you know in time we'll win.

And hello
I wish you well
Where you sleep
All in your cell.

So time give me a break of a week or more.
My head is reeling and my back is sore.
And the baby cries for me.
And I think I'll walk by the sea alone.

",Fifteen Months
Joan Baez,"(Words and Music by Joan Baez)

The grey quiet horse wears the reins of dawn,
And nobody knows what mountain he's from.
In his mouth he carries the golden key,
And nobody sees him but Gabriel and me.
Gabriel and me.

His nose is silver and his mane is white,
His eyes are black and starry like night.
So softly he splashes his hoofs in the sea,
That nobody hears him but Gabriel and me.
Gabriel and me.

He comes in the morning when the air is still,
He races the sun and he always will.
We raise up the window and call through the trees,
Oh we'd love to fly with you, Gabriel and me.
Gabriel and me.

For your back is wingless and there's room for two,
We'll mount from a tree and ride straight on through.
But I guess you're wiser than I thought you'd be,
For you never will listen to Gabriel and me.
Gabriel and me.

For you know that one day we'll forget to wake,
Call it destiny, call it fate.
You'll nuzzle us softly and so silently,
We'll ride in the morning, Gabriel and me,
With the golden key.
Gabriel and me,
Forever to the sea.

When the mist rolls in on Highway One
Like a curtain to the day
A thousand silhouettes hold out their thumbs
And I see them and I say
You are my children
My sweet children
I am your poet.

With hair just like the burning tree of Moses
The girl beside you is your twin
Behind your fiery make-up you should know this
I am your sister, I am your kin, your flesh and kin
I'll write this tune
In matching phrases
Just to show it

You are the orphans in an age
Of no tomorrows
And with your walking you wage a war
Against the sorrows
Your fathers left you
A row to hoe
And you'll hoe it.

If I could write you easy directions
On a list
You would not read it, you could not see it
For the mist
Besides my pen is
Very righteous
And I know it.

So walk to the edges of a dying kingdom
There's one more summer just around the bend
The amber in your smile is brave and winsome
For though your highway has no end, it never ends
There is still the sky
The windy cliff
And the sea below it
I'd take an angel's ram horn trumpet
And I'd blow it
I'd blow it.

",The Hitchhikers' Song
Joan Baez,"You're tired and you're poor, 
You long to be free, 
But in this Godforsaken land 
You find no home, no family 

On the many roads that you've wandered 
Since the day of your birth. 
You've become one of the last, 
Lonely and wretched. 

Your hair is matted, 
Your face and hands are dirty, 
And the years that you've toiled 
Must number somewhere near thirty. 

The deepening of a sadness 
Broke finally into madness. 
You are truly one of the last, 
Lonely and wretched. 

Your eyes are wild and frightening 
At the same time they are blessed 
And I wonder if God died, 
Turned his back or only just rested. 

And you walked out on the seventh day 
Through the big gates and on your way 
To become one of the last, 
Lonely and wretched. 

For once you were a child. 
Your cheeks were red, 
You were well fed. 
You laughed and played 

Till you got teary, 
Ran to your mother 
When you were weary. 
But somewhere you were forsaken 

Alone I'll not bear the blame 
And somehow all was taken, 
Your mind, your body, your name. 
Forgive us our unkindness, 

Our desertion and our blindness, 
With you, all the last, 
Lonely and wretched. 
Forgive us, all the last, 

Lonely and wretched.","Last, Lonely and Wretched"
Joan Baez,"(Words and Music by Joan Baez)

Outside the Nashville city limits
A friend and I did drive,
On a day in early winter
I was glad to be alive.
We went to see some friends of his
Who lived upon a farm.
Strange and gentle country folk
Who would wish nobody harm.
Fresh-cut sixty acres,
Eight cows in the barn.
But the thing that I remember
On that cold day in December
Was that my eyes they did brim over
As we talked.

In the slowest drawl I had ever heard
The man said ""Come with me
If y'all wanna see the prettiest place
In all of Tennesee.""
He poured us each a glass of wine
And a-walking we did go,
Along fallen leaves and crackling ice
Where a tiny brook did flow.
He knew every inch of the land
And Lord he loved it so.
But the thing that I remember
On that cold day in December
Was that my eyes were brimming over
As we walked.

He set my down upon a stone
Beside a running spring.
He talked in a voice so soft and clear
Like the waters I heard sing.
He said ""We searched quite a time
For a place to call our own.
There was just me and Mary John
And now I guess we're home.""
I looked at the ground and wondered
How many years they each had roamed.
And Lord I do remember
On that day in late December
How my eyes kept brimming over
As we talked.
As we walked.

And standing there with outstretched arms
He said to me ""You know,
I can't wait till the heavy storms
Cover the ground with snow,
And there on the pond the watercress
Is all that don't turn white.
When the sun is high you squint your eyes
And look at the hills so bright.""
And nodding his head my friend said,
""And it seems like overnight
That the leaves come out so tender
At the turning of the winter...""
I thought the skies they would brim over
As we talked.

Let's drink to the lowly of birth
Raise your glass to the good and the evil
Let's drink to the salt of the earth

Say a prayer for the common foot soldier
Spare a thought for his back breaking work
Say a prayer for his wife and his children
Who burn the fires and who still till the earth

When I search a faceless crowd
Swirling mass of grey, black and white
They don't look real to me
In fact they look so strange

Raise your glass to the hard working people
Let's drink to the uncounted head
Let's think of the wavering millions
Who want leaders but get gamblers instead

Spare a thought for the stay-at-home voter
His empty eyes gaze at strange beauty shows
And a parade of gray suited grafters
A choice of cancer or polio

And when I search a faceless crowd

Joan Baez,"His daddy was a simple man, just a red dirt Georgia farmer
And his momma spent her young live havin´ kids and balin´ hay
He had fifteen years and an ache inside to wander
So he hopped a freight in Waycross and wound up in L.A.

Lord, the cold nights had no pity on a Waycross, Georgia farm boy
Most days he went hungry then the summer came
He met a girl known on the strip as San Francisco´s Mabel Joy
Destitution´s child born of an L.A. street called ""Shame""

Growin´ up came quietly in the arms of Mabel Joy
Laughter found their mornings brought meaning to his life
Yes the night before she left sleep came and left that 
Waycross, Georgia boy with dreams of Georgia cotton and a California wife

Sonday morning found him standin´ ´neath the red light at her door
When a right cross sent him reelin´ put him face down on the floor
In place of Mabel Joy he found a merchant mad marine
Who growled, ""Your Georgia neck is red but sunny, you´re still green""

He turned twenty-one in a grey rock fed´ral prison
The old judge had no mercy for a Waycross, Georgia boy
Starin´ at those four grey walls in silence he would listen
To that midnight freight he knew would take him back to Mabel Joy

Sunday morning´ found him standin´ ´neath the red light at her door
With a bullet in his side, he cried, ""Have you seen Mabel Joy?""
Stunned and shaken someone said, ""Why she´s not here no more 
She left this house four years today, they say she´s lookin´ for some Georgia farm boy""",San Francisco Mabel Joy
Joan Baez,"In the early dawn 
A stallion white 
Prances the hills 
In the morning light
His bridle is painted 
With thunder and gold
Orchids and dragons 
Pale knights of old
He´s the horse of the ages past

And now the children run
To see the stallion on the hill
Bringing bags of apples 
And of clover they have filled
And the white horse 
Tells his stories
Of the days
Now passed and gone
And the children stand 
A-wondering
Believing 
Every song
How brightly glows the past

When the sun is high
Comes a mare so red
A-trampling the graves 
Of the living and dead
Her mantle is heavy
With mirrors and glass
All is reflected 
When the red mare does pass
She´s the horse of the here and now

And now there is confusion 
´mongst the children on the hill
They cling to one another 
And no longer can be still
While the red mare´s 
Voice is trembling
With a rare and 
Mighty call
The children 
Start remembering 
The bearers 
And the the pall
And though their 
Many-colored sweaters 
Are reflecting 
In the glass
And though the sun
Shines down upon them
They are frightened 
In the grass
How stark is the here and now

When the night does fall
Comes a stallion black
So proud and tall
He never looks back
He wears him no emaralds
Silver or gold
Not even a covering
To keep him from cold
He´s the horse of the years to come

And I will get me down 
Before this steed upon my knees
And sing to him the sorrows
Of a thousand centuries
And the children 
Now will scatter
As their mothers 
Call them home
For the sadness 
Of the evening horse
No child 
Has ever known
And I will 
Hang about him
A bell that´s 
Never rung
And thank him 
For the many words
Which from his throat
Have never sprung
And I´ll thank God 
And all the angels
That the stallion 
Of the evening 
The black horse 
Of the future 
Comes to earth but has no tongue",Three Horses
Joan Baez,"(Words and Music by Joan Baez)

The music stopped in my hand
My hand
My hand
Sadly smiled the band
The band
The band
Softly echoes your laughter
Riddled with tears
When time is stolen it flies
It flies
It flies
Lovers leave in disguise
Disguise
Disguise
Weariness hangs like a curtain
Heavy and old
Heavy and cold.

It is said to never look back
Look back
Look back
To shadows you left on the track
The track
The track
Gather your roses and run
The long way around
And if time should ever be right
My love
My love
I'll come to you in the night
My love
My love
But now there is only the sorrow
Parting is near
Parting is here
Parting is here
Parting is here

",When Time Is Stolen
Joan Baez,"Blessed are the one-way ticket
Holders on the one-way street
Blessed are the midnight-riders
For in the shadow of God they sleep

Blessed are the huddled hikers
Staring aut at falling rain
Wond´ring at the retribution
In their personal acquaintance with pain

Blessed are the blood relations
Of the young ones who have died
Who had not the time or patience
To carry on this earthly ride.

Rain will come and winds will blow,
Wild deer die in the mountain snow.
Birds will beat at Heaven´s wall,
What comes to one must come to all.

For you and I are one-way ticket
Holders on that one-way street
Which lies across a golden valley
Where the waters of joy and hope run deep.

So if you pass the parents weeping
Of the young ones who have died
Take them to your warmth and keeping
For blessed are the tears the cried
and many were the years they tried
Take them to that valley wide
And let their souls be pacified.",Blessed Are...

The children cannot comprehend
But when there is a promised land
The brave will go and others follow
The beauty of the human spirit
Is the will to try our dreams
And so the masses teemed across the ocean
To a land of peace and hope

As they were tumbled onto shore
And none was welcomed by the echo of the phrase

Go through the years and you will find 
What's blackened all of history

And heart to heart 
And I sense when I look at the stars 
That we are children of life

Which takes your father from your side 
Forgive me all who are my friends 
I am with you, so do not cry 

If mother wants to be distracted 
From the sadness and the soulness 
You take her for a walk 
Along the quiet country 
And rest beneath the shade of trees 
Where here and there you gather flowers 
Beside the music and the water 
Is the peacefulness of nature 
She will enjoy it very much 
And surely you'll enjoy it too 
But son, you must remember 
Do not use it all yourself 
But down yourself one little step 
To help the weak ones by your side 

Forgive me, son, for this unjust death 
Which takes your father from your side 
Forgive me all who are my friends 
I am with you, so do not cry 

The weaker ones that cry for help 
The persecuted and the victim 
They are your friends 
And comrades in the fight 
And yes, they sometimes fall 
Just like your father 
Yes, your father and Bartolo 
They have fallen 
And yesterday they fought and fell 
But in the quest for joy and freedom 
And in the struggle of this life you'll find 
That there is love and sometimes more 
Yes, in the struggle you will find 
That you can love and be loved also 

Forgive me all who are my friends 
I am with you

Billy Rose was a low rider, Billy Rose was a night fighter
Billy Rose knew trouble like the sound of his own name
Busted on a drunken charge
Driving someone else's car
The local midnight sheriff's claim to fame

In an Arizona jail there are some who tell the tale how
Billy fought the sergeant for some milk that he demanded
Knowing they'd remain the boss
Knowing he would pay the cost
They saw he was severely reprimanded

In the blackest cell on ""A"" Block
He hanged himself at dawn
With a note stuck to the bunk head
Don't mess with me, just take me home

Come and lay, help us lay
Young Billy down

Luna was a Mexican the law called an alien
For coming across the border with a baby and a wife
Though the clothes upon his back were wet
Still he thought that he could get
Some money and things to start a life

It hadn't been too very long when it seemed like everything went wrong
They didn't even have the time to find themselves a home
This foreigner, a brown-skin male
Thrown into a Texas jail
It left the wife and baby quite alone

He eased the pain inside him
With a needle in his arm
But the dope just crucified him
He died to no one's great alarm

Come and lay, help us lay
Young Luna down
And we're gonna raze, raze the prisons
To the ground

Kilowatt was an aging con of 65 who stood a chance to stay alive
And leave the joint and walk the streets again
As the time he was to leave drew near
He suffered all the joy and fear
Of leaving 35 years in the pen

And on the day of his release he was approached by the police
Who took him to the warden walking slowly by his side
The warden said ""You won't remain here
But it seems a state retainer
Claims another 10 years of your life.""

He stepped out in the Texas sunlight
The cops all stood around
Old Kilowatt ran 50 yards
Then threw himself down on the ground

They might as well just have laid
The old man down
And we're gonna raze, raze the prisons
To the ground
Help us raze, raze the prisons
To the ground

The triangle tingles and the trumpets play slow
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is on fire and I must go

There's nothing to prove, everything's still the same
Just a table standing empty by the edge of the sea
Means farewell, Angelina, the sky is trembling and I must leave

The jacks and queens have forsaked the courtyard
Fifty-two gypsies, now file past the guards
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is changing color, I'll see you in a while

See the cross-eyed pirates sitting perched in the sun
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun
And the neighbors they clap and they cheer with each blast
But farewell, Angelina, the sky's changing color and I must leave fast

King Kong, little elves on the rooftops they dance
Valentino-type tangos while the make-up man's hands
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is embarrassed and I must be gone

The machine guns are roaring, the puppets heave rocks
The fiends nail time bombs to the hands of the clocks
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting, I must go where it's quiet

Oh, where have you been, my darling young one?

I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways

I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard

Oh, what did you see, my blue eyed son?

I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it

I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a bleedin'
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children

And it's hard, and it's hard, it's hard, it's hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall

And what did you hear, my blue eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder, is it roared out a warnin'
Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world

I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a blazin'
I heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin'
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin'
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley

And who did you meet, my blue eyed son?
Oh, who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog

I met a young woman whose body was burning
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded with hatred

And it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall

Oh, what'll you do now, my blue eyed son?
Oh, what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Well, I'm a goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a fallin'
Well, I'll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest

Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
Where the executioner's face is always well hidden

Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten
Where black is the color, and none is the number
And I'll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it

And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin'
But I'll know my song well before I start singin'

And it's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall
",A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall
Joan Baez,"You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast

Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun
Look out the saints are comin' through
And it's all over now, baby blue

The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence

The empty-handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheet
This sky, too, is folding under you
And it's all over now, baby blue

All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
All your reindeer armies are all going home

Your lover who just walked out your door
Has taken all her blankets from the floor
The carpet, too, is moving under you
And it's all over now, baby blue

Leave your stepping stones behind you, something calls for you
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you

A vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore
Strike another match, let's start anew
And it's all over now, baby blue
Oh, it's all over now, baby blue
","It's All Over Now, Baby Blue"
Joan Baez,"The lady cam from Baltimore
All she wore was lace
She didn't know that I was poor
She never saw my face

I was sent to steal her money
Take her rings and run
But I fell in love with the lady
Came away with none

the lady's name was Suzanne Moore
Her daddy read her law
She didn't know that I was poor
Livin' outside the law

I was sent to steal her money
Take her rings and run
But I fell in love with the lady
Came away with none

her daddy said I was a thief
And didn't have her love(?)
But I (that?) was Suzanne's true belief
I married her for love (?)

I was sent to steal her money
Take her rings and run
But I fell in love with the lady
Came away with none

the way she lived in ?
To keep the robbers out
She never stop to think it all
That's what I'm about

Take her rings and run
But I fell in love with the lady

",The Lady Came from Baltimore
Joan Baez,"Ten years ago on a cold dark night,
Someone was killed 'neath the Town Hall light
The people who saw they all agreed
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me.

The judge said, ""son, what is your alibi?
If you were somewheres else,
Then you won't have to die"".
I spoke not a word, though it meant my life,
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife.

She walks these hills in a long black veil,
Visits my grave when the night winds wail,
Nobody knows, nobody sees,
Nobody knows, but me.

The scaffold is high, eternity near,
She stands in the crowd, she sheds not a tear,
But sometimes at night, when the cold winds moan,
In a long black veil she cries o'er my bones.

You know your mother was born to die

Too late my brothers, too late
But never mind
All my trials, Lord soon be over

The river of Jordan is chilly and cold
It chills the body but it warms the soul,
All my trials, Lord soon be over

I've got a little book with pages three,
And every page spells liberty,
All my trials Lord, soon be over
Too late my brothers, too late
But never mind

If living were a thing that money could buy,
You know the rich would live
And the poor would die,

The Christians call it the tree of life,

Too late my brothers, too late

Joan Baez,"I was born in east Virginia 
North Carolina I did roam 
There I met a fair pretty maiden 
Her name and age, I do not know 

Her hair, it was of a bright some color 
And her lips of a ruby red 
On her breast she wore white lilies 
There I longed to lay my head 

Well, in my heart you are my darling 
And at my door, you're welcome in 
At my gate, I'll meet you my darling 
If your love I could only win 

I'd rather be in some dark holler 
Where the sun refused to shine 
Then to see you another man's darling 
And to know that you'll never be mine 

Well, in the night I'm dreaming about you 
In the day, I find no rest 
Just the thought of you my darling 
Sends aching pains all through my breast 

Well, when I'm dead and in my coffin 
With my feet turned toward the sun 
Come and sit beside me darling 
Come and think on the way you done",East Virginia

And leave you for awhile 
Wherever I go, I will return

To leave me here alone 
Well, I may lie, lament and cry 
And you'll, you'll not hear my mourn, 
And you'll, no you'll, and you'll not hear my mourn 

Oh, the crow that is so black, my love 
Will change his color white

Joan Baez,"There were three brothers in merry Scotland
In merry Scotland there were three
And they did cast lots which of them should go
Should go, should go
And turn robber all on the salt sea

The lot it fell first upon Henry Martin
The youngest of all the three
That he should turn robber all on the salt sea
Salt sea, the salt sea
For to maintain his two brothers and he

They had not been sailing but a long winter's night
And a part of a short winter's day
When he espied a stout lofty ship
Lofty ship, lofty ship
Come bibbing down on him straight way

""Hello, hello"", cried Henry Martin
What makes you sail so nigh?
I'm a rich merchant ship bound for fair London Town
London Town, London Town
Would you please for to let me pass by?

""Oh no, oh no"", cried Henry Martin
This thing it never could be
For I have turned robber all on the salt sea
Salt sea, the salt sea.
For to maintain my two brothers and me

Come lower your tops'l and brail up your mizz'n
And bring your ship under my lee
Or I will give you a full cannon ball
Cannon ball, cannon ball
And all your dear bodies drown in the salt sea

Oh no, we won't lower our lofty topsail
Nor bring our ship under your lee
And you shan't take from us our rich merchant goods
Merchant goods, merchant goods
Nor point our bold guns to the sea

Then broadside and broadside and at it they went
For fully two hours or three
Till Henry Martin gave to them deathshot
The deathshot, the deathshot
And straight to the bottom went she

Bad news, bad news to old England came
Bad news to fair London Town
There's been a rich vessel and she's cast away
Cast away, cast away
And all of her merry men drowned

Joan Baez,"There is a house in New Orleans

I`d have been at home today,
But I was young and foolish, oh, God
Let a rambler lead me astray

Don't do what I have done

Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

Living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be.
For though they may be parted there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be.

There is still a light that shines on me

But spirit took you from the start
It made you brave and it gave you heart

You worked so hard that the earth took pride
It gave you sage, wild thyme and rue

There'll be a place for you somewhere
To tie bright ribbons through your hair

Tell me when you see them
Gathered at the shore
Dancing on their broken chains
Ah, the ladies are no more
In their blue jeans and their necklaces
Against an evening sky
But some of them are weeping
Crying rider, please pass by

The ship with all the riders
Has drifted out to sea
Compass cracked and stars unnamed
It's lost to history
And the riders in captivity
Watch ancient waves roll high
And hear the distant voices
Crying rider, please pass by

All you men who should have been
Your fathers beat you down
Your mothers loved you badly
Your teachers stole your crowns
And the wars you fought have taken toll
The price was far too high
You've buried all the images
Of riders passing by

The horses of the riders
Have waited at the tide
But years have passed, they know at last
Their heroes will not ride
So the women oh so gracefully
Mount noble horses high
Shattering the timelessness
Of rider, please pass by

But who can dare to judge us
The women or the men?
If freedom's wings shall not be clipped
We all can love again
So the choice is not of etiquette
Or finding lonesome ways to die
But liberty to ships at sea
And riders passing by

But liberty to ships at sea
And riders passing by

","Rider, Pass By"
Joan Baez,"(Words and Music by Joan Baez)

It's walking to the battleground that always makes me cry
I've met so few folks in my time who weren't afraid to die
But dawn bleeds with the people here and morning skies are red
As young girls load up bicycles with flowers for the dead

An aging woman picks along the craters and the rubble
A piece of cloth, a bit of shoe, a whole lifetime of trouble
A sobbing chant comes from her throat and splits the morning air
The single son she had last night is buried under her

They say that the war is done
Where are you now, my son?

An old man with unsteady gait and beard of ancient white
Bent to the ground with arms outstretched faltering in his plight
I took his hand to steady him, he stood and did not turn
But smiled and wept and bowed and mumbled softly, ""Danke shoen""

The children on the roadsides of the villages and towns
Would stand around us laughing as we stood like giant clowns
The mourning bands told whom they'd lost by last night's phantom messenger
And they spoke their only words in English, ""Johnson, Nixon, Kissinger""

Now that the war's being won
Where are you now, my son?

The siren gives a running break to those who live in town
Take the children and the blankets to the concrete underground
Sometimes we'd sing and joke and paint bright pictures on the wall
And wonder if we would die well and if we'd loved at all

The helmetless defiant ones sit on the curb and stare
At tracers flashing through the sky and planes bursting in air
But way out in the villages no warning comes before a blast
That means a sleeping child will never make it to the door

The days of our youth were fun
Where are you now, my son?

From the distant cabins in the sky where no man hears the sound
Of death on earth from his own bombs, six pilots were shot down
Next day six hulking bandaged men were dazzled by a room
Of newsmen. Sally keep the faith, let's hope this war ends soon

In a damaged prison camp where they no longer had command
They shook their heads, what irony, we thought peace was at hand
The preacher read a Christmas prayer and the men kneeled on the ground
Then sheepishly asked me to sing ""They Drove Old Dixie Down""

Yours was the righteous gun
Where are you now, my son?

We gathered in the lobby celebrating Chrismas Eve
The French, the Poles, the Indians, Cubans and Vietnamese
The tiny tree our host had fixed sweetened familiar psalms
But the most sacred of Christmas prayers was shattered by the bombs

So back into the shelter where two lovely women rose
And with a brilliance and a fierceness and a gentleness which froze
The rest of us to silence as their voices soared with joy
Outshining every bomb that fell that night upon Hanoi

With bravery we have sun
But where are you now, my son?

Oh people of the shelters what a gift you've given me
To smile at me and quietly let me share your agony
And I can only bow in utter humbleness and ask
Forgiveness and forgiveness for the things we've brought to pass

The black pyjama'd culture that we tried to kill with pellet holes
And rows of tiny coffins we've paid for with our souls
Have built a spirit seldom seen in women and in men
And the white flower of Bac Mai will surely blossom once again

I've heard that the war is done
Then where are you now, my son?

",Where Are You Now My Son
Joan Baez,"(Words and Music by Joan Baez)

A young gypsy fell out in a slumber
Heading north with a driver he knew
Someone he'd lived with and trusted
A young woman who trusted him too

That very same day the young gypsy
Had come from a farm in the west
Where the children had played throughout the heat of the day
Affording the gypsy no rest

And the gypsy's bones were weary
And the front seat looked secure
And the gypsy slept on until the sun it was gone
And the stars pierced the eyes of the girl at his side

The next morning's day would be Easter
He'd dress in his only fine shirt
And shuffle through clusters of strangers
With his gaze and his shoes in the dirt

And the woman who loved him would watch him
Protect him from curious stares
For the womenfolk tend to be friendly
And the gypsy's as young as he's fair

And the evening brought on laughter
And jars of bright red wine
And the gypsy drank some and the gypsy had fun
And his dancing got wild and the grandmothers smiled

Sleeping came easily after
In the arms of the woman that fold
Up the secrets and dreams of the gypsy
That will never be sought or be sold
In fact, they will never be told
For the gypsy is two years old

Que he ganado una batalla
Que he ganado una batalla
Why herido ya el sol se asoma
Te busco en la madrugada
DÃ¡me tu pecho, paloma.

Flor que no se abre a su dueÃ±o
Se apaga en la madrugada
Al filo de un esquinazo
Como el lucero en tu almohada
Paloma why tÃº entre mis brazos.

Palomita entre mis brazos
Punteando se viene el alba
Oye el rumor de las armas
Que ya suenan los balazos
Que ya suenan los balazos
Escucha lo que yo siento
No vuela la alondra en vano
Si en brazos la lleva el viento.

Me dio el corazon que agita su marco
Cuando miro el fruto del cerebro humano,
Cuando miro al bueno tan lejos del malo,
Cuando miro al fondo de tus ojos claros

Negro pero cariñoso
Yo soy como el chile verde, llorona
Picante pero sabroso

Ay! De mi, llorona
Llorona de ayer y hoy
Ayer maravilla fui, llorona

Dame la mano desde la profunda zona de tu dolor diseminado
No volverás del fondo de las rocas
No volverás del tiempo subterráneo
No volverá tu voz endurecida
No volverán tus ojos taladrados
Yo vengo a hablar por vuestra boca muerta
A través de la tierra juntad todos los silenciosos labios derramados

Y desde el fondo habladme toda esta larga noche
Como si estuviera con vosotros anclado
Contadme todo, cadena a cadena, eslabón a eslabón, y paso a paso
Afilad los cuchillos que guardasteis
Ponedlos en mi pecho y en mi mano
Como un rio de rayos amarillos
Como un rio de tigres enterrados
Y dejadme llorar horas, días, años, edades ciegas, siglos estelares

Dadme el silencio, el agua, la esperanza
Dadme la lucha, el hierro, los volcanes
Apegadme los cuerpos como imanes
Acudid a mis venas y a mi boca
Hablad por mis palabras y mi sangre

Come on girls
You believe in love
'Cause I've got something to sing about it
And it goes something like this

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast you know they never last no, no
What you need is a big strong hand to
Lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

He needs to start with your head

So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own

So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees to express himself
You've got to make him express himself, hey hey

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe

Joan Baez,"WINDS OF THE OLD DAYS (Words and Music by Joan Baez)
The lady's adrift in a foreign land
Singing on issues both humble and grand A
Decade flew past her and there on the page
She read that the prince had returned to the stage
Hovering near treacherous waters
A friend saw her drifting and caught her
Unguarded fantasies flying too far
Memories tumbling like sweets from a jar And take me down to the harbor now Grapes of the summer are low on the bough
Ghosts of my history will follow me there
And the winds of the old days will blow through my hair
Breath on an undying ember It doesn't take much to remember
Those eloquent songs from the good old days
That set us to marching with banners ablaze
But reporters, there's no sense in prying
Our blue-eyed son's been denying
The truths that are wrapped in a mystery
The sixties are over so set him free
And take me down to the harbor now
Grapes of the summer are low on the bough
Ghosts of my history will follow me there
And the winds of the old days will blow through my hair
Why do I sit the autumnal judge
Years of self-righteousness will not budge
Singer or savior, it was his to choose
Which of us knows what was his to lose
Because idols are best when they're made of stone
A savior's a nuisance to live with at home
Stars often fall, heroes go unsung
And martyrs most certainly die too young
So thank you for writing the best songs
Thank you for righting a few wrongs
You're a savage gift on a wayward bus
But you stepped down and you sang to us
And get you down to the harbor now
Most of the sour grapes are gone from the bough
Ghosts of Johanna will visit you there
And the winds of the old days will blow through your hair

That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost, but now I'm found,
Was blind, but now I see.

't Was Grace that taught my heart to fear,
And Grace my fear relieved.
How precious did that Grace appear,
The hour I first believed.

Through many dangers, toils and snares
We have already come.
't Was Grace that brought us safe thus far,
Grace will lead us home.

When we've been there ten thousands years,
Bright shining as the sun.
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun.",Amazing Grace

How many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
How many times must the cannon balls fly
Before they're forever banned?

I got on this airplane just to fly
I know there's life below me
But all that you can show me 
Is the prairie and the sky

I don't want to hear your sad story
About heartache and desire
The last time I felt like this
I was in the wilderness
And the canyon was on fire
And I stood on the mountain, in the night
And I watched it burn, I watched it burn

I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
I would hold my life in his saving grace 
I would walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham 
If I thought I could see, I could see your face

Well you really got me this time 
And the hardest part is knowing I'll survive 
I have come to listen for the sound 
Of the trucks as they move down 
Out on highway ninety five 
And pretend that it's the ocean 
Coming down to wash me clean, to wash me clean 
Baby do you know what I mean

I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
I would hold my life in his saving grace 
I would walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham 
If I thought I could see, I could see your face",Boulder to Birmingham

They say every man must fall
But I swear I see my reflection
Some place so high above this wall
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
Is a man who swears he's not to blame
All day long I hear him shout so loud
Crying out that he's been framed
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now

Takes more than guns to kill a man

And standing there as big as life
And smiling with his eyes

Says Joe What they can never kill

In every mine and mill,
Where working-men defend there rights,

Joan Baez,"The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down
Anyone with any sense had already left town
He was standing in the doorway lookin' like the Jack of Hearts

He moved across the mirrored room, ""Set ?em up for everyone"", he said
Then everyone commenced to do what
They've been doin' before he moved their heads
He walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin
""Would you kindly tell me, Mister, what time the show begins?""
He moved into the corner, face down like the Jack of Hearts

Backstage the girls were playin' five-card stud by the stairs
Lily had two queens and she was hopin' for a third to match her pair
Outside the streets were fillin' up and the window was open wide
The gentle breeze was blowin', you could feel it from inside
Lily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts

Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine
He made his usual entrance lookin' oh, so dandy and so fine
With his bodyguards and his silver cane and every hair in place
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste
But his bodyguards and his silver cane
They were no match for the Jack of Hearts

Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town
She slipped in through the side door lookin' like a queen without a crown
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear
""I'm sorry, darlin', that I'm late"", but he didn't seem to hear
He was staring into space over at the Jack of Hearts

Well, I know I've seen that face somewhere
Big Jim was thinkin' to himself
Maybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebody's shelf
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet
And the house lights did dim
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him
Starin' at the butterfly who just drew up the Jack of Hearts

Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child
She had that certain something
It was a kind of a flash every time she smiled
She'd come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
With men in every walk of life who took her everywhere
But she'd never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts

The hangin' judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined
The drilling in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
And nothin? could ever come between Lily and the king
No, nothing ever could except maybe the Jack of Hearts

Rosemary started drinkin' hard and seein' her reflection in the knife
She was tired of the attention, tired of playin' the role of Big Jim's wife
She'd done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide
Was lookin' to do just one good deed before she died
She was gazin' to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts

Lily took her dress off, buried it away
""Has your luck run out"", she laughed at him
""I guess you must've known it would someday
Be careful not to touch the wall, there's a brand-new coat of paint
I'm glad to see you're still alive and you're lookin' like a saint""
Down the hallway footsteps were comin' for the Jack of Hearts

The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair
""There's something funny goin' on, I know, I can just feel it in the air""
He went to get the hangin' judge but the hangin' judge was drunk
And the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk
But there was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts

Lily had her arms around the man that she dearly loved to touch
She forgot all about the man she hated, who hounded her so much
""I've missed you so"", she said to him and he thought she was sincere
But in the hallway he felt jealousy and fear
Just another night in the life of the Jack of Hearts

Well, no one knew the circumstance
But they say it happened pretty quick
The door to the dressing room burst open and a cold revolver clicked
And Big Jim was standin' there, you couldn't say surprised
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes
She was with Big Jim but she was leanin' to the Jack of Hearts

Two doors down and the boys finally made it through the wall
Cleaned out the bank safe, it's said that they got off with quite a haul
And in the darkness of the riverbed, they waited on the ground
For one more member who had business back in town
But they couldn't go no further without the Jack of Hearts

Well, the next day was hangin' day
And the sky was overcast and black
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back
And Rosemary on the gallows, boy, she didn't even blink
And the hangin' judge was sober, Lord, he hadn't had a drink
And the only person on the scene missing was the Jack of Hearts

Well, the cabaret was quiet now and a sign said, 'Closed for repair'
Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair
She was thinkin' 'bout her father whom she very rarely saw
Thinkin' about Rosemary and thinkin' about the law
But most of all she was thinkin' about the Jack of Hearts
","Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts"
Joan Baez,"How long since I've spent a whole night in a twin bed with a stranger 
His warm arms all around me? 
How long since I've gazed into dark eyes that melted my soul down 
To a place where it longs to be? 
All of your history has little to do with your face 
You're mainly a mystery with violins filling in space 

You stood in the nude by the mirror and picked out a rose 
From the bouquet in our hotel 
And lay down beside me again and I watched the rose 
On the pillow where it fell 
I sank and I slept in a twilight with only one care 
To know that when day broke and I woke that you'd still be there 

The hours for once they passed slowly, unendingly by 
Like a sweet breeze on a field 
Your gentleness came down upon me and I guess I thanked you 
When you caused me to yield 
We spoke not a sentence and took not a footstep beyond 
Our two days together which seemingly soon would be gone 

Don't tell me of love everlasting and other sad dreams 
I don't want to hear 
Just tell me of passionate strangers who rescue each other 
From a lifetime of cares 
Because if love means forever, expecting nothing returned 
Then I hope I'll be given another whole lifetime to learn 

Because you gave to me oh so many things it makes me wonder 
How they could belong to me 
And I gave you only my dark eyes that melted your soul down 
To a place where it longs to be","Love Song to a Stranger, Pt. II"

To a place by the river.
You can see the boats go by,
You could spend the night forever.
And you know that she's half crazy
And that's why you want to be there.
And she feeds you tea and oranges
That come all the way from China.
And just when you mean to tell her
That you have no love to give her,
She takes you in her arms
And she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover.

And you want to travel with her,
And you want to travel blind.
And you think you'll maybe trust her
'Cause she's touched you,
And she's moved you,
And she's kind.

Jesus was a sailor
When he walked up the water.
He spent a long time watching
From a lonely wooden tower.
And when He knew for certain
Only drowning men could see Him,
He said, ""All men shall be sailors then,
Until the sea shall free them.""
He Himself was broken
Long before the sky was open;
Forsaken, almost human,
He sank beneath your wisdom like a star.

And you want to travel with Him,
And you want to travel blind.
And you think you'll maybe trust Him
'Cause He's touched you
And He's moved you,
And He's kind.

And she leads you to the river.

Beneath the garbage and the flowers.
There are heroes in the seaweed,
There are children in the morning.

Infinity gives me chills
So could the waters of Iceland
But there's a difference in finding diamonds in rust
And rhinestones in a dishpan
Miracles bowl me over
And often will they do so
Now I think I was asleep till I heard
The voice of the great Caruso

Bring infinity home
Let me embrace it one more time
Make it the lilies of the field
Or Caruso in his prime

A friend of mine gave me a tape
She'd copied from a record disc
It was made at the turn of the century
And found in a jacket labeled ""misc.""
And midst cellos, harps, and flugelhorns
With the precision of a hummingbird's heart
Was the lord of the monarch butterflies
One-time ruler of the world of art

Bring infinity home
Let me embrace it one more time
Make it the lilies of the field
Or Caruso in his prime

Yes, the king of them all was Enrico
Whose singular chest could rival
A hundred fervent Baptists
Giving forth in a tent revival
True he was a vocal miracle
But that's only secondary
It's the sould of the monarch butterfly
That I find a little bit scary

Bring infinity home
Let me embrace it one more time
Make it the lilies of the field
Or Caruso in his prime

Perhaps he's just a vehicle
To bear us to the hills of Truth
That's Truth spelled with a great big T
And peddled in the mystic's booth
There are oh so many miracles
That the western sky exposes
Why go looking for lilacs
When you're lying in a bed of roses?

Bring infinity home
Let me embrace it one more time
Make it the lilies of the field
Or Caruso in his prime

",Caruso
Joan Baez,"(Words and Music by Joan Baez)

It's only when the high winds blow that I wish my hair was long
Sailing through the autumn leaves singing an ancient song
Or falling in love in the streets at night at the edge of a local square
It's only that I'm here tonight thinking I was there

There are high winds on the pier tonight, my soul departs from me
Striding like Thalia's ghost south on the murky sea
And into midnight's tapestry she fades, ragged and wild
Searching down her ancestry in the costume of a Persian child

And gulf winds bring me flying fish that shine in the crescent moon
Show me the horizon where the dawn will break anew
And cool me here on this lonely pier where the heron are flying low
Echo the songs my father knew in the towns of Mexico

When I was young my eyes were wise, my father was good to me
Instead of having a flock of sons he had two other girls and me
And if we had used our Spanish names, here's the way they'd run
Thalia, Margarita and Juanita, I'm the middle one.

The screen door kept the demons in as we moved from town to town
It's hard to be a princess in the States when your skin is brown
And mama smoothed my worried brow as I leaned on the kitchen door
Why do you carry the weight, she said, of the world and maybe more?

And gulf winds bring me flying fish that shine in the crescent moon
Show me the horizon where the dawn will break anew
And cool me here on this lonely pier where the heron are flying low
Echo the songs my father knew in the towns of Mexico

My grandfathers were ministers and it came on down the line
My father preached in his parents' church when he was ten years and nine
And mama dressed in parishoners' clothes and didn't believe in hell
Her daddy fought the DAR, if he'd lived I'd have known him well

They said go find a Sunday School, we must have tried them all
I never stole from the silver plate, my sisters had more gall
One preacher said sing out loud and clear, it's the only life you've got
And the next one said be good on earth, you've another life at the feet of God

And gulf winds bring me flying fish that shine in the crescent moon
Show me the horizon where the dawn will break anew
And cool me here on this lonely pier where the heron are flying low
Echo the songs my father knew in the towns of Mexico

My father turned down many a job just to give us something real
It's hard to be a scientist in the States when you've got ideals
And mama kept the budget book, she kept the garden, too
Bought fish from the man on Thursday, fed all of us and strangers, too

But time will pass and so, alas, will most of what we know
Though tonight my memory's eye is clear as the story's being told
And I'll play ball with the underdog and sit with the child who's wrong
Be still when the earth is silent and sing when my strength is gone

And gulf winds bring me flying fish that shine in the crescent moon
Show me the horizon where the dawn will break anew
And cool me here on this lonely pier where the heron are flying low
Echo the songs my father knew in the towns of Mexico

Now father's going to India sometime in the fall
They tried to stay together but you just can't do it all
I'll think about him if he goes, there's a little grey in his hair
Though not much because he's Mexican, they don't age, they just prepare

And if he goes to India I'll miss him most of all
He'll see me in the mudlarks' face, hear me in the beggar's call
And mama will stay home, I guess, and worry if she did wrong
And I'll say a prayer for both of them and sing them both my song

And gulf winds bring me flying fish that shine in the crescent moon
Show me the horizon where the dawn will break anew
And cool me here on this lonely pier where the heron are flying low
Echo the songs my father knew in the towns of Mexico

",Gulf Winds
Joan Baez,"(Words and Music by Joan Baez)

The ship that sails the seven seas
Has finally brought me to my knees
It's not much to my liking
The people standing on the rock
Are innocent and they know not
That the tide comes in
Death rides it like a Viking

The mountains rise above the mist
And the golden prince I've never kissed
He may die tonight
And why do I want to ride with
The prince whose alleged horse is white?
Because when we ride together
Our lives are cloaked forever

Happiness is temporary
Believe me, I know
It can arrive as a shining crystal
And leave as the melting snow
Come all you lads and lasses
The Kingdom of Childhood passes

Oh, but I am hardy in these years
Or I'd have sunk down with my tears
To the earth beneath my feet
I want to endure the slings and arrows
That Hamlet spoke about
But harrowed,
He was forced to a ragged defeat

There was a method to his madness
But overcome by pride and sadness
He did not endure
Surely his death was a grave mistake
How many deaths do we really calculate?
Isn't it true, Lord
Tragedies happen when you're bored?

Happiness is temporary
Believe me, I know
It can arrive as a shining crystal
And leave as the melting snow
Come all you lads and lasses
The Kingdom of Childhood passes

You archangels, you have some nerve
To watch all of this you are absurd
You even have a choice
Do you know all? I think you may
And what is there for you to say
But understand
Why God took back your voice

SIlence is golden, I believe
And you are worth your weight
In wreaths of purest gold
While we are here with debts and bets
And aircraft carriers and jets
I call out fruitlessly
Give me an archangel for company

Happiness is temporary
Believe me, I know
It can arrive as a shining crystal
And leave as the melting snow
Come all you lads and lasses
The Kingdom of Childhood passes

Me in the woods at the break of dawn
The candles of the night still on
The chimes ring from the hollow
I too am worth my weight in gold
But the fishmonger and I are old
When the mint runs out
Our real lives will follow

It was misfortune who woke you up
To pour you the dregs from her broken cup
Cast her aside
The sunrise will appear with the mockingbird
Who stays deep in the canyon and is heard
Glorious in his song
He cannot be wrong

Happiness is temporary
Believe me, I know
It can arrive as a shining crystal
And leave as the melting snow
Come all you lads and lasses
The Kingdom of Childhood passes
There's another one just beyond
Act quickly before it's gone

",Kingdom of Childhood
Joan Baez,"(Words and Music by Joan Baez)

Don't worry about my politics
They are what they are
I work best when I get some rest
Right now I'm in a bar
Overlooking the whole wide world
It's over the Pacific
I've never written when I was drunk
This could be terrific!

And the seabird struggles in the wind
She topples, balances again

The lady sitting next to me
Is gazing in the eyes
Of the stranger sitting next to her
Who is mouthing truths and lies
He's actually quite nice I guess
He has an honest look
He doesn't know I've lost my mind
Scribbling in this book

And the seabird struggles in the wind
She topples, balances again

Consumed by the evening's masterpiece
Completely introverted
From here I could stare down eternity
Leave alone and not feel deserted
I'm tired of interesting faces
And the dull ones make my weep
Don't ask me what my sign is
Instant intimacy runs cheap

The ocean is so bountiful
It spreads from coast to coast
The winds scale off the whitecaps
And the things I love the most
Come wafting up into my lap
In the colors of the great sunrise
Children holding cupcakes
With paradise in their eyes

And the seabird struggles in the wind
She topples, balances again

Four big pelicans just flew by
The room got very still
One of them carried the breath of God
Tucked way back in his bill
I know it was the breath of God
It's the same as the secret of life
He's carrying it off to the Shah of Iran
To trade it for the end of strife

And the seabird struggles in the wind
She topples, balances again

",Seabirds
Joan Baez,"(Words and Music by Joan Baez)


""You've loved me exquisitely.""
""I tried to.""
""Can we be best of friends now?""
""I never lied to you.""
""And can I love you forever?""
""Sure,"" she said and smiled
""But will you?""

I wish there was some new way
To sing about a full moon
Poured down on us like a thousand rivers
In Stephanie's room
And you said you'd remember always
The shadows on the hills below us
But will you?

You never once tried to sell me
A bill of goods I wouldn't buy
But I'm seasoned and I know a pirate
By the devil in his eye
And the only thing you ever stole from me
Was laughter and some love I made
To fill you

White snow in the morning
Kind of frightened me
But you'd go sailing anyway
Things are different at sea
You know I'll never try and change your habit
As sure as you know if your ship sinks
It'll kill you

And all the lovely ladies who came before me
Are very much the same
As the others soon to follow
In your merry little game
I guess I just want to be remembered
Especially and frequently
Like Stephanie

Five red tail hawks are circling
Above us in the sky
You said they'd bring good luck
And then you said goodbye
You smiled and said, ""I'll see you
Sooner than you think.""
But will you?

",Stephanie's Room
Joan Baez,"(Words and Music by Joan Baez)

Still waters at night
In the darkest of dark
But you rise as white
As the birch tree's bark
Or a pale wolf in winter
You look down and shiver
At still waters at night

Your eyes are as black
As the blackness you're fearing
And yonder a bridge
And a voice within hearing
Come walk on me softly
Look down and you'll see
Still waters at night

You've reason to fear
There is no protection
But a garland of emeralds
And a moonlit reflection
Of a boat in the distance
Will the devil take his chance
At still waters at night

So dance me a small dance
And the night cannot hurt you
Nor the waters be silent
Nor the emeralds desert you
For the boat's full of bright scarves
And wild hats among them
Songs of the vagabond
It's to you he has sung them
And shattered the silence
Of still waters at night

",Still Waters at Night
Joan Baez,"Red telephone sitting by my bed 
Practically bore your name 
Lying alone in the twilight zone 
Waiting for your call to come in 
Hadn't been for the kid 
Who was sleeping upstairs 
You'd have found me well on my way 
On that midnight plane to L.A. 

You suffered sweeter for me 
Than anyone I've ever known 

I dared to look into the years 
Would you still have your wife? 
I dared to peer through my tears 
Could we ever have a life? 
Even thought I was pregnant by you 
But I didn't care 
I just talked to my son 
Would he mind another one? 

You suffered sweeter for me 
Than anyone I've ever known 

Once more the mist rolls to the sea 
Like a hundred times we've known 
Trees are faded and the clouds have stopped 
Where the wind had blown 
How I dread when the evening comes 
And I cannot be 
What you want me to be 
When you are next to me 

How silent you are as the veils come down 
Before my eyes 
Soft and reserved as you move away 
Donning your disguise 
While every folk song that I ever knew 
Once more comes true 
And loves grows old 
And waxes cold 

You suffered sweeter for me 
Than anyone I've ever known 

Just one favor of you, my love 
If I should die today 
Take me down to where the hills 
Meet the sea on a stormy day 
Ride a ridge on a snow white horse 
And throw my ashes away 
To the wind and the sand 
Where my song began 

You suffered sweeter for me 
Than anyone I've ever known",Sweeter for Me
Joan Baez,"(Words and Music by Joan Baez)

The moon is low on the southland
The frogs are asleep on the lake
Did you know that tears run in rivulets
And hearts can repeatedly break?
And this may well be the last time
If my spirits don't pick up and fly
For though it's sad
It may well be true
That our time is passing us by

Occasionally you have called for me
I've always tried to be there
But it seemed whenever my train pulled in
You never did really care
And the only thing I could decipher
From the corner of your roving eye
Was that you and I
Were the first ones to know
That our time was passing us by

Well, it was fun for the first few years
Playing Legend In Our Time
And there were those who discussed the fact
That we drifted apart in our prime
And we haven't got too much in common
Except that we're so much alike
And I hate it for though
You're a big part of me
But our time is passing us by

So I can sit here in my silver chair
You can stay there on your gold
You can say you've got commitments
And I can say I'm growing old
And I can get up and make comments
On the color of the evening sky
But our ships have come home
And the night's rolling in
And our time is passing us by

But cast us adrift
And cross a few stars
And I'm good for one more try

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried, cried, cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me, out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember, all that you said
You told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me and

Now you say, you say you love me
Well, just to prove that you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
'Cause I cried a river over you

I owe every word to you

""You've always meant so much to us 
Don't want to bother you and have a nice day""

Who speak so carefully 
To their friend with a life unlike their own

And nothing is given to man
Be not too hard when he is sold or bought

Be not too hard when he blindly dies
Fighting for things he does not own
Be not too hard when he tells lies
Or if his heart is sometimes like a stone

Often no wiser than he began
Be not too hard for life is short

Joan Baez,"It's a still life water color,
Of a now late afternoon,
As the sun shines through the curtained lace
And shadows wash the room.
And we sit and drink our coffee
Couched in our indifference,
Like shells upon the shore
You can hear the ocean roar
In the dangling conversation
And the superficial sighs,
The borders of our alliance.

And you read your Emily Dickinson,
And I my Robert Frost,
And we note our place with bookmarkers
That measure what we've lost.
Like a poem poorly written
We are verses out of rhythm,
Couplets out of rhyme,
In syncopated time
And the dangled conversation
And the superficial sighs,
Are the borders of our alliance.

Yes, we speak of things that matter,
With words that must be said,
""Can analysis be worthwhile?""
""Is the theater really dead?""
And how the room is softly faded
And I only kiss your shadow,
I cannot feel your hand,
You're a stranger now unto me
Lost in the dangling conversation.
And the superficial sighs,
In the borders of our alliance.




",The Dangling Conversation
Joan Baez,"""Well met, well met, my own true love
Well met, well met"", cried he
""I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
All for the love of thee""

I could have married the king's daughter dear
She would have married me
But I have forsaken her crowns of gold
All for the love of thee

Well, if you could have married
The king's daughter dear
I'm sure you are to blame
For I am married to a house carpenter
And find him a nice young man

Oh, will you forsake your house carpenter
And go along with me?
I'll take you to where the grass grows green
To the banks of the salt, salt sea

Well, if I should forsake my house carpenter
And go along with thee
What have you got to maintain me on
And keep me from poverty?

Six ships, six ships all out on the sea
Seven more upon dry land
One hundred and ten all brave sailor men
Will be at your command

She picked up her own wee babe
Kisses gave him three
Said, ""Stay right here with my house carpenter
And keep him good company""

Then she put on her rich attire
So glorious to behold
And as she trod along her way
She shown like the glittering gold

Well, they'd not been gone
But about two weeks
I know it was not three
When this fair lady began to weep
She wept most bitterly

Ah, why do you weep, my fair young maid
Weep it for your golden store?
Or do you weep for your house carpenter
Who never you shall see anymore?

I do not weep for my house carpenter
Or for any golden store
I do weep for my own wee babe
Who never I shall see anymore

Well, they'd not been gone
But about three weeks
I'm sure it was not four
Our gallant ship sprang a leak and sank
Never to rise anymore

One time around spun our gallant ship
Two times around spun she
Three times around spun our gallant ship
And sank to the bottom of the sea

What hills, what hills are those, my love
That rise so fair and high?
Those are the hills of heaven, my love
But not for you and I

And what hills, what hills are those, my love
Those hills so dark and low?
Those are the hills of hell, my love
Where you and I must go

Joan Baez,"Seems like only yesterday
I left my mind behind
Down in the gypsy cafe
With a friend of a friend of mine

She sat with a baby heavy on her knee
Yet spoke of life most free from slavery
With eyes that showed no trace of misery
A phrase in connection first with she occurred

That love is just a fou letter word

Outside a rambling store-front window
Cats meowed to the break of day
Me, I kept my mouth shut
To you I had no words to say

My experience was limited and underfed
You were talking while I hid
To the one who was the father of your kid
You probably didn't think I did, but I heard you say

That love is just a four letter word

I said goodbye unnoticed
Pushed forth into my own games
Drifting in and out of lifetimes
Unmentionable by name

Searching for my double, looking for
Complete evaporation to the core
Though I tried and failed at finding any door
I must have thought that there was nothing more absurd than

That love is just a four letter word

Though I never knew just what you meant
When you were speaking to your man
I can only think in terms of me
And now I understand

After waking enough times to think I see
The holy kiss that's supposed to last eternity
Blow up in smoke, its destiny, falls on strangers, travels free
Yes, I know now, traps are only set by me
And I do not really need to be assured

That love is just a four letter word

Strange it is to be beside you
Many years and tables turned
You'd probably not believe me
If I told you all I've learned

And it is very, very weird indeed yo hear words like forever plead
Those ships run through my mind, I cannot cheat
It's like looking in the teacher's face complete
I can say nothing to you but repeat what I heard

That love is just a four letter word
",Love Is Just a Four-Letter Word
Joan Baez,"Come gather 'round, friends
And I'll tell you a tale
Of when the red iron ore pits ran plenty
But the cardboard filled windows
And old men on the benches
Tell you now that the whole town is empty

In the north end of town
My own children are grown
But I was raised up on the other
In the wee hours of youth
My mother took sick
And I was brought up by my brother

The iron ore poured
As the years passed the door
The drag lines an' the shovels was a-humming
Till one day my brother
Failed to come home
The same as my father before him

Well, a long winter's wait
From the window I watched
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder
And my schooling was cut
As I quit in the spring
To marry John Thomas, a miner

Oh, the years passed again
And the givin' was good
With the lunch buckets filled every season
What with three babies born
The work was cut down
To a half a day's shift with no reason

Then the shaft was soon shut
And my work, it was cut
And the firing air, it felt frozen
Till a man come to speak
And he said in one week
That number eleven was closin'

They complained in the East
That they are paying too high
They say that your ore ain't worth digging
That it's much cheaper down
In South American town
Where the miners work almost for nothing

So the mining gates locked
And the red iron rotted
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
Where the sad, silent song
Made the hour twice as long
As I waited for the sun to go sinking

I lived by the window
As he talked to himself
This silence of tongues, it was building
Then one morning's wake
The bed, it was bare
And I's left alone with three children

The summer is gone
The ground's turning cold
The stars, one by one, they're a-foldin'
My children will go
As soon as they grow
Oh, there ain't nothing here now to hold them
",North Country Blues
Joan Baez,"In my heart I will wait 
By the stony gate 
And the little one 
In my arms will sleep. 
Every rising of the moon 
Makes the years grow late 
And the love in our hearts will keep. 
There are friends I will make 
And bonds I will break 
As the seasons roll by 
And we build our own sky. 
In my heart I will wait 
By the stony gate 
And the little one 
In my arms will sleep. 

And the stars in your sky 
Are the stars in mine 
And both prisoners 
Of this life are we. 
Through the same troubled waters 
We carry our time, 
You and the convicts and me. 
There's a good thing to know 
On the outside or in, 
To answer not where 
But just who I am. 
Because the stars in your sky 
Are the stars in mine 
And both prisoners 
Of this life are we. 

And the hills that you know 
Will remain for you 
And the little willow green 
Will stand firm. 
The flowers that we planted 
Through the seasons past 
Will all bloom 
On the day you return. 
To a baby at play 
All a mother can say, 
He'll return on the wind 
To our hearts, and till then 
I will sit and I'll wait 
By the stony gate 
And the little one 
'Neath the trees will dance.",A Song for David
Joan Baez,"For all we know
We may never meet again
Before we go
Make this moment live again
We won't say goodbye
Until the last minute
I'll hold out my hand
And my heart will be in it

For all we know
This might only be a dream
We come and we go
Like the ripples, like the ripples in the stream
So baby, love me, love me tonight
Tomorrow was made for some
Oh, but tomorrow
But tomorrow may never, never come
For all we know
Yes, tomorrow may never, never come
For all we know",For All We Know
Joan Baez,"Here by my window in Germany 
A morning bird flies close to me 
On his wing I see a yellow star 
The lights are on in the factory 
The frost is hung on the linden tree 
And I remember where we are 
And I remember the holocaust 
I remember all we lost 
The families torn and the borders crossed 
And I sing of it now for Sasha 
A young German officer lies in his bed 
Bandages from toe to head 
A prisoner of the camps draws nigh 
If you are Abel and I am Cain 
Forgive me from my bed of pain 
I know not why we die 
It was I who ordered the building burned 
The job was over and as I turned 
A father and his son 
Caught in the flames high above the ground 
From cradled arms the boy looked down 

One leap and their lives were done 
And I remember the holocaust 
I remember all we lost 
The children gone and the borders crossed 
And I sing of it now for Sasha 
You in frozen streets of Heidelberg 
Your youth unbearded takes form in words 
And the ghosts of the past are kind 
For this was your university 
The years were long but the spirits free 
And your river runs to the Rhine 
The smoke filled taverns that you once roamed 
With the discontented who'd stayed at home 
You must have whiskey or you'll die 
The beer garden under the old chateau 
Our faces now in the candle glow 
See the memories how they shine 
But you remember the holocaust 
You remember all we lost 
The families torn and the borders crossed 
And we'll sing of it now for Sasha",For Sasha
Joan Baez,"Early early in the game 
I taught myself to sing and play 
And use a little trickery 
On kids who never favored me 
Those were years of crinoline slips 
And cotton skirts and swinging hips 
And dangerously painted lips 
And stars of stage and screen 
Pedal pushers, ankle socks 
Padded bras and campus jocks 
Who hid their vernal equinox 
In pairs of faded jeans 
And slept at home resentfully 
Coveting their dreams 
And often have I wondered 
How the years and I survived 
I had a mother who sang to me 
An honest lullaby 
Yellow, brown, and black and white 
Our Father bless us all tonight 
I bowed my head at the football games 
And closed the prayer in Jesus' name 
Lusting after football heroes 
tough Pachuco, little Neroes 
Forfeiting my A's for zeroes 
Futures unforeseen 
Spending all my energy 
In keeping my virginity 
And living in a fantasy 
In love with Jimmy Dean 
If you will be my king, Jimmy, Jimmy, 
I will be your queen 
And often have I wondered 
How the years and I survived 

I had a mother who sang to me 
An honest lullaby 
I travelled all around the world 
And knew more than the other girls 
Of foreign languages and schools 
Paris, Rome and Istanbul 
But those things never worked for me 
The town was much too small you see 
And people have a way of being 
Even smaller yet 
But all the same though life is hard 
And no one promised me a garden 
Of roses, so I did okay 
I took what I could get 
And did the things that I might do 
For those less fortunate 
And often have I wondered 
How the years and I survived 
I had a mother who sang to me 
An honest lullaby 
Now look at you, you must be growing 
A quarter of an inch a day 
You've already lived near half the years 
You'll be when you go away 
With your teddy bears and alligators 
Enterprise communicators 
All the tiny aviators head into the sky 
And while the others play with you 
I hope to find a way with you 
And sometimes spend a day with you 
I'll catch you as you fly 
Or if I'm worth a mother's salt 
I'll wave as you go by 
And if you should ever wonder 
How the years and you'll survive 
Honey, you've got a mother who sings to you 
Dances on the strings for you 
Opens her heart and brings to you 
An honest lullaby",Honest Lullaby
Joan Baez,"In the time spent in the foggy dew 
With the raven and the dove 
Barefoot she walked the winter streets 
In search of her own true love 

For she was Mary Hamilton 
And lover of John Riley 
And the maid of constant sorrow 
And the mother of the doomed Geordie 

One day by the banks of the river 
Midst tears and gossamer 
Sweet Michael rowed his boat ashore 
And came to rescue her 

And fill thee up my loving cup 
Fast and to the brim 
How many fair and tender maids 
Could love as she could then? 

For was was likened to Pretty Boy Floyd 
And also John Riley 
And a rake and rambling railroad boy 
And the Silkie of the Sule Skerry 

And there in the arms of Michael 
In their stolen hour 
Loud rang the bells of Rhymney 
From the ancient church bell tower 

And there in the night with Michael 
While he lay fast asleep 
She put her head to the window pane 
And in the fullness of love did weep 

And fill thee up my loving cup 
Fast and to the brim 
How many fair and tender maids 
Will love as she did then? 

You've heard of the House of the Rising Sun 
And what careless love can do 
You've heard of the wildwood flower 
That fades in the morning dew 

And of the ship that circles three times round 
And sinks beneath the sea 
You've heard of Barbary Allen 
And now you've heard of me 

So fill thee up my loving cup 
Fast and to the brim 
How many fair and tender maids 
Will ever love again?",Michael
Joan Baez,"On the banks of the river,
Where the willow hangs down
On the wild washing waters,
With that low mourning sound.
Down in the hollow
Where the water runs cold,
It was there I first listened
To the lies that you told.

Now I lie on my bed,
And I see your sweet face.
The past I remember;
Time can't erase.
The letter you wrote me
Was written in shame.
And I know that your conscience
Still echoes my name.

Now the nights are so alone
And my sorrow runs deep.
And nothing is worth for you and me,
One more night without sleep.
I woke up alone;
I take a look at my sky.
Too empty to sing,
Too lonely to cry.

If you ladies were blackbirds
And you ladies were thrushes,
I'd lie there for hours
In them cold chilly marshes.
But if ladies were squirrels,
With them high bushy tails;
I'd fill up my shotgun
With rock, salt and nails.

If you ladies were squirrels,
With them high bushy tails;
I would load up my shotgun
With rock, salt and nails.

Joan Baez,"It won't be easy, you'll think it strange
When I try to explain how I feel
But I still need your love after all that I've done.

You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you.

I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staring out of the sun.

So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to.

Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance.

And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired.

They are illusions
They are not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me.

Joan Baez,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me

Tell me where did you sleep last night?
In the pines, in the pines where the sun never shines
I'd shiver the whole night through

My father was a railroad man
Killed a mile and a half from town
His head was found 'neath driver's wheel
His body have never been found

You caused me to weep, you caused me to moan
You caused me to leave my home

Black girl, black girl, where will you go?
I'll gog where the cold wind moan
In the pines, in the pines where the sun never shines
I'd shiver the whole night through

Longest train I ever saw
Was a hundred coaches long
And the only boy I ever loved
Is on that train and gone

And love's a jewel when it's first new
But love grows old and waxes cold
And fades away like morning dew

But not so deep as my love for him

Joan Baez,"Willie Moore was a young man, his age 21 and he courted a damsel fair
Oh, her eyes were as white as a diamond after night and a wavy jet black wore her hair
He courted her by night and day until marriage they did agree
Oh, but when he came to get her parents' consent they said it could never be

She threw herself in Willie Moore's hands as often they've done before
Oh, but little did he think as he left her that night, sweet Annie he would see no more
It was about the 10th of may, a time i remember it well
That very same night little Annie disappeared in a way no tongue can tell

Sweet Annie was loved both far and near, she had friends almost all around
And near a little brook not far from her home the body of sweet Annie were found
Her parents now are left alone, one mourns while the other'n weeps
And near a grassy mound outside the cottage door the body of sweet Annie sleeps

In an Arizona jail there are some who tell the tale how
Billy fought the sergeant for some milk that he demanded.
Knowing they'd remain the boss
Knowing he would pay the cost

Who stood a chance to stay alive
And leave the joint and walk the streets again
As the time he was to leave drew near

And on the day of his release
He was approached by the police
Who took him to the warden, walking slowly at his side

But ist seems a state retainer
Claims another 10 years of your life.""

Joan Baez,"They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark
She looked at him he felt a spark tingle to his bones
It was when he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
And watched out for a simple twist of fate

They walked down by the old canal a little confused I remember well
And then they stopped in a strange hotel with the neon burning bright
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train
And moving with a simple twist of fate

Saxophone some place nearby played she was walking on by at the arcade
As a light burst through a bead of shade
But as he was waking she dropped a coin into a cup of a blind man
That became and both got a bout of a simple twist of fate

He woke up and the room was bear, he didn't see he anywhere
He told himself he didn't care, he pushed the window open wide
He felt an emptiness inside too
He could just not relate but by a simple twist of fate

He hears the ticking of the clocks small waves whisper to the rocks
He hunts her down by the waterfront docks
Where the sailors all come in perhaps he'll see her once again
How long must he wait once more for a simple twist of fate

People tell me it's a crime to feel to much at any one time
All it cost me was a dime but the bells refuse to ring
He was born in the spring but I was born to late to blame
It on a simple twist of fate

As you walked on the sands of glory 
With James and the gang 
You were one magnificent story 
You and James and the gang 
When all your illusions did lie in the palm of your hand 
And your limits were only the sky and the rolling sand 
And of every summer to come 
This summer would be the one 
You'd remember forever 
In your dreams 
Oh, twinkle, twinkle little star 
Did you ever wonder who you are 
And do you think that life is just a Belushi movie 
And the heartbreak years that lie ahead 
Be true to yourself and the Grateful Dead 
And remember the summer when all was hip and groovy 
And you walked on the sands of glory 
With James and the gang 
You were one magnificent story 
You and James and the gang 
Hush little baby, momma once was sixteen 
On the back of a Harley Davidson 
Boyfriend was a born again 
He shouted from the word of Jesus while doing 105 
Down the coast highway 
Only half a day from where 
You walked on the sands of glory 
With James and the gang 
You were one magnificent story

Recently it all came back to me
Somebody promised us roses
We slid by for awhile on dreams
But today I see what's only a memory
Of a decade ago that vanished from sight
With the speed of a shooting star
Leaving you, leaving me, where we are...

Well, you could say we sailed on stormy seas
Or you could say that we failed like seven out
Of ten in our neighboorhood
But I prefer remembering the way we were
When we both thought the other had hung the moon
Cause too soon
Came the troubled times and the
Broken rhymes so hard to define
Till recently

Oh, I could have tried for a thousand years
Through the long and winding night
Could have cried another million tears
It would never come out right

And recently the product of all our years
Dressed in a navy blue blazer
Headed for a first class school in the East
And I'd like to say he's hardly a failure now
And neither are you on the second time round
With a wife and a family
And the roses that lately arrived
In the new baby's eyes
So recently",Recently
Joan Baez,"I wished I had you in Carrickfergus,
Only for nights in Ballygrand,
I would swim over the deepest ocean,
The deepest ocean to be by your side.

But the sea is wide and I can't swim over
And neither have I wings to fly.
I wish I could find me a handy boatman
To ferry me over to my love and die.

My childhood days bring back sad reflections
Of happy days so long ago.
My boyhood friends and my own relations.
Have all passed on like the melting snow.

So I'll spend my days in endless roving,
Soft is the grass and my bed is free.
Oh to be home now in Carrickfergus,
On the long road down to the salty sea.

And in Kilkenny it is reported
On marble stone there as black as ink,
With gold and silver I did support her
But I'll sing no more now till I get a drink.

I'm drunk today and I'm rarely sober,
A handsome rover from town to town.
Oh but I am sick now and my days are numbered
Come all ye young men and lay me down",Carrickfergus
Joan Baez,"It's four in the morning, the end of December
I'm writing you now just to see if you're better
New York is cold, but I like where I'm living
There's music on Clinton Street all through the evening.
I hear that you're building your house deep in the desert
Are you living for nothing now, hope you're keeping some kind of record.
Yes, and Jane came by with a lock of your hair
She said that you gave it to her
That night when you planned to go clear
Did you ever go clear?
Ah, the last time we saw you, you looked so much older
Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder
You'd been to the station to meet every train
But she never turned up I'm Lili Marlene
And you treated some woman to a flake of your life
And when she got home she was nobody's wife.
Well I see you there with a rose in your teeth
One more thin gypsy thief
Well I see Jane's awake
She sends her regards.
And what can I tell you oh what can I tell you
What can I possibly say?
I guess that I miss you, I guess I forgive you
I'm glad that you stood in my way.
And if you ever come by here, be it for Jane or for me
I want you to know your enemy's sleeping, I want you to know your woman is free.
Yes, and thanks, for the trouble you took from her eyes
I thought it was there for good so I never really tried.
And Jane came by with a lock of your hair
She said that you gave it to her
That night when you planned to go clear

Joan Baez,"Jimmy got nothing, made himself a name
With a gun that he polished for a rainy day
A smile and a quote from a vigilante movie
Our boy Jimmy just blew them all away

He said it made him crazy
Twenty five years living hand to mouth
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth

Sweet little baby on a big white doorstep
She needs her mother but her mother is dead
Just another hooker that the lucky can forget
Just another hooker, it happens everyday

She loved her little baby
But she couldn't bear to see her living hand to mouth
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth

I believe in the gods of America
I believe in the land of the free
But no one told me
That the gods believe in nothing

So with empty hands I pray
And from day to hopeless day
They still don't see me

Everybody talks about the new generation
Jump on the wagon or they'll leave you behind
But no one gave a thought to the rest of the nation
Like to help you buddy but I haven't got the time

Somebody shouted, ""Save me""
But everybody started living hand to mouth
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth

There's a big white lady on a big white doorstep
She asked her daddy and her daddy said, ""Yes""
Has to give a little for the dollars that we get
Has to give a little, they say it's for the best

Somebody shouted, ""Maybe""
But they kept on living from hand to mouth
Hand to mouth, hand to mouth, hand to mouth

So she ran to the arms of America
And she kissed the powers that be
And someone told me
That the gods believe in nothing

So with empty hands I pray
And I tell myself one day
They just might see me
They just might see me

Will the children of the eighties be ashes or live to their prime 
If we don't heed reasonable people and their warnings of days to come 
We'll all be incinerated Warriors of the Sun 
We'll be there to feed the hungry and to tend to the sick 
We'll be there when the night gets black and the going gets thick 
We'll be there to carry your feeble, your hopeless and your weary ones

He walked and he talked in truth until the day that he died

Joan Baez,"Word is to the kitchen gone, and word is to the Hall
And word is up to Madam the Queen, and that's the worst of all
That Mary Hamilton has borne a babe
To the highest Stuart of all
Oh rise, arise Mary Hamilton
Arise and tell to me
What thou hast done with thy wee babe
I saw and heard weep by thee
I put him in a tiny boat
And cast him out to sea
That he might sink or he might swim
But he'd never come back to me
Oh rise arise Mary Hamilton
Arise and come with me
There is a wedding in Glasgow town
This night we'll go and see
She put not on her robes of black
Nor her robes of brown
But she put on her robes of white
To ride into Glasgow town
And as she rode into Glasgow town
The city for to see
The bailiff's wife and the provost's wife
Cried Alack and alas for thee
You need not weep for me she cried
You need not week for me
For had I not slain my own wee babe
This death I would not dee
Oh little did my mother think
When first she cradled me
The lands I was to travel in
And the death I was to dee
Last night I washed the Queen's feet
And put the gold in her hair
And the only reward I find for this
The gallows to be my share
Cast off cast off my gown she cried
But let my petticoat be
And tie a napkin round my face
The gallows I would not see
Then by them come the king himself
Looked up with a pitiful eye
Come down come down Mary Hamillton
Tonight you will dine with me
Oh hold your tongue my sovereign liege
And let your folly be
For if you'd a mind to save my life
You'd never have shamed me here
Last night there were four marys
Tonight there'll be but three
It was Mary Beaton and Mary Seton
And Mary Carmichael and me.



",Mary Hamilton
Joan Baez,"A holiday, a holiday, and the first one of the year
Lord DArlen's wife came into the church,
The gospel for to hear.

And when the meeting it was done, she cast her eyes about
And there she saw little Matty Groves, walking in the crowd
""Come home with me, little Matty Groves, come home with me tonight
Come home with me, little Matty Groves, and sleep with me till light""
""Oh, I can't come home, I won't come home and sleep with you tonight
By the rings on your fingers I can tell you are my master's wife""
""But if I am Lord Arlen 's wife, Lord Arlen's not at home
He is out in the far cornfields bringing the yearlings home""

And a servant who was standing by and hearing what was said
He swore Lord Arlen he would know before the sun would set
And in his hurry to carry the news, he bent his breast and ran
And when he came to the broad millstream, he took off his shoes and he swam

Little Matty Groves, he lay down and took a little sleep
When he awoke, Lord Arlen was standing at his feet
Saying ""How do you like my feather bed and how do you like my sheets
How do you like my lady who lies in your arms asleep?""
""Oh, well I like your feather bed and well I like your sheets
But better I like your lady gay who lies in my arms asleep""
""Well, get up, get up,"" Lord Arlen cried, ""get up as quick as you can
It'll never be said in fair England that I slew a naked man""
""Oh, I can't get up, I won't get up, I can't get up for my life
For you have two long beaten swords and I not a pocket knife""
""Well it's true I have two beaten swords and they cost me deep in the purse
But you will have the better of them and I will have the worse
And you will strike the very first blow and strike it like a man
I will strike the very next blow and I'll kill you if I can""

So Matty struck the very first blow and he hurt Lord Arlen sore
Lord Arlen struck the very next blow and Matty struck no more
And then Lord Arlen took his wife and he sat her on his knee
Saying ""Who do you like the best of us, Matty Groves or me?""
And then up spoke his own dear wife, never heard to speak so free
""I'd rather a kiss from dead Matty's lips than you or your finery""

Lord Arlen he jumped up and loudly he did bawl
He struck his wife right through the heart and pinned her against the wall
""A grave, a grave,"" Lord Arlen cried, ""to put these lovers in
But bury my lady at the top for she was of noble kin""

Once I had sweetheart, and now I have none,
She's gone and leave me, she's gone and leave me,
She's gone and leave me to sorrow and moan.

Last night in sweet slumber I dreamed I did see,
Last night in sweet slumber I dreamed I did see,
My own precious jewel sat smiling by me,
My own precious jewel sat smiling by me.

And when I awakened I found it not so,
And when I awakened I found it not so,
My eyes like some fountain with tears overflow,
My eyes like some fountain with tears overflow.

I'll venture through England, through France and through Spain,

All my life I will venture the watery main,

Joan Baez,"To the queen of hearts is the ace of sorrow
He's here today, he's gone tomorrow
Young men are plenty but sweethearts few
If my love leaves me what shall I do?

Had I the store in yonder mountain
Where gold and silver is there for counting
I could not count for thought of thee
My eyes so full I could not see

I love my father, I love my mother
I love my sister, I love my brother
I love my friends and relatives too
I'll forsake them all and go with you

To the queen of hearts is the ace of sorrow
He's here today, he's gone tomorrow
Young men are plenty but sweethearts few
If my love leaves me what shall I do ?



",Queen of Hearts
Joan Baez,"I had a dream I was following a barefoot girl
Beside a dream that flowed around the world
And we spoke of many things, though her mouth never moved
As the most peculiar scenes were disappearing into view

Oh what a dream, beyond the realm of why
Pretty little beings beneath the yawning sky
Speaking of god as though they could define
Music to the deaf and color to the blind
Or god to man

And then the leaves became a thousand tears
And I was on my knees in a crazy house of mirrors
I couldn't find my face but a voice was drawing nearer
Hush baby - sweet baby - hush, don't you cry

And I thought I woke and my mother was standing there
And my heart broke as the ribbons in her hair
Turned into highways, surrounded and swirled
Like a crown come down around a not-so-perfect world

In the corner of the dream was the man with the blue guitar
It had no strings but the music touched the stars
And his long dark curls turned to gold before my eyes
And the barefoot girl smiled off to the side
And it was real

Then a thousand birds took flight with a joyful noise
And I heard the angels up on high rejoice
I could see my face and I recognized the voice
Hush baby - sweet baby - hush, baby, hush

It's just a dream, one of those that goes on and on
Scene after scene, with the rhythm of a gypsy song
When I really woke, I was frozen in between
I didn't know who I was, it was a dream inside a dream

It's all a dream
Oh what a dream
I had a dream",The Dream Song
Joan Baez,"My house stands at the edge of glory
Steady as the seasons change
Dreams of grace arise before me
And they call me home again

I went forth with no protection
Through a fierce and a blinding rain
Seeking truth but not perfection
Saw my father's face again

Father father can you hear me
Through this swirl of thoughts unsaid
Dreams of grace arise before me
And they call me home again

My house stands at the edge of glory
Steady as the seasons change
Dreams of grace arise before me
And they call me home again

Take this hand that I hold out
Meant to bridge the years apart
Come in come in from the howling wind
To the clearing of my heart

Still and lovely came the morning
Gone was my father's face
In my house a bright reflection
New among my dreams of grace

My house stands at the edge of glory
Steady as the seasons change
Dreams of grace arise before me
And they call me home again",Edge of Glory
Joan Baez,"So it's time to set you free
Watch you sail away from me
Though I'll miss you when you do,
I'm with you

Turn your face into the wind
Let your greatest dreams begin
Take the high road, win or lose
I'm with you

I was there in the morning light
with a love that would last
And I'll be there on your darkest night
when the sun's long gone and your heart is sinking fast

When you stumble, when you fall
When they back you to the wall
After all the rest are through
I'm with you

So it's time to set you free
Watch you sail away from me
Though I'll miss you when you do,

Joan Baez,"Hard times, hard times in Canaan land
Trouble in the mind of a man
A voice came whispering softly to him
Go offer, offer up the lamb

Abraham took his only son
High up on a hill
His test of faith had finally come
As the wind, the wind begin to chill

Cold steel, cold steel in the father's hand
Tears falling from the sky
The angels, the angels did not understand
Why the righteous, the righteous boy should die

Abraham most mysteriously
Laid down that deadly knife
Said, ""My darlin' son, I wish I was the one
Who spared you, spared your precious life""

Will shine upon this mountain high
And never, never fade away
And never fade away

What if you got it, what you're praying for? Careful what you pray

You turn around, the old way is gone, you wonder how you will carry on
All my pride I will lay aside, I will steal across the border for you

Lying in the dusty shadows of your bed, dreaming on a clear blue sky
Paying for something that you never even did, victim of a time gone by

You turn around, everything has changed, familiar scenes have been rearranged
All my life I will work and strive, I will steal across the border for you
All my pride I will lay aside, I will steal across the border for you.",Steal Across the Border
