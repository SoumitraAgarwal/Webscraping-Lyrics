Allison Moorer,"When the quiet in this old house shows no mercy
And the lonesome just won't go away
That's when your restless spirit haunts me
And I swear, I hear you call my name

[Chorus]
I always loved the sound of your sweet voice
But now that sounds makes my poor heart break
You're long gone, baby, that's for certain
Cause I'm a hurtin', when I hear you call my name

I pray when I pass on over
That we will meet in the place where lost souls stay
Maybe then, when I look over my shoulder
You'll be there, when I hear you call my name

[Chorus]

I'm certain, I hear you call my name",Call My Name
Allison Moorer,"I've heard it said
Life leaves you memories that are precious
If that's true, it hasn't left me any yet
There are none that I've thought of I can cherish
For me it's easier to forget

Looking back is not the way to mend my heartache
Remembering only brings me regret
When I dig up the past, I find a love that didn't last
So for me, it's easier to forget

I'd hate to think these memories I've been given
Are the only ones I'm ever gonna get 
'Cause it hurts if I try to relieve'em
For me it's easier to forget

Looking back is not the way to mend my heartache
Remembering only brings me regret
When I dig up the past, I find a love that didn't last
So for me, it's easier to forget

For me it's easier to forget",Easier to Forget
Allison Moorer,"I found a letter that you wrote me
It said I was your one and only
And you would never ever leave my loving arms
But the truth is all that matters
Your pretty words no longer flatter
'Cause I know they didn't come from your heart

I found your guitar in the closet
I remember when you bought it
And how you serenaded me under the stars
Now there's no one here to play it
You changed your tune, I hate to say it
But the songs didn't come from your heart

In your heart, I believed I'd found the love of my dreams
I hoped my search was through
But now, all I'm finding are memories that remind me
What a fool I was, to think it was true

I found your ring still on my finger
It's been there since we saw the preacher
And swore to him, in front of God, death do us part
It's just a fourteen-carat trinket
But like my promise, I will keep it
Even though it didn't come from your heart
I found a letter that you wrote me",I Found a Letter
Allison Moorer,"Heard the preacher at the service
Declare you'd gone home that day
To meet the maker and his servants
And take a rest amidst his grace

He said now that you're in heaven
Your trials on earth are through
But I didn't hear him mention
If heaven's good enough for you

He claimed you feel no more sorrow
Since you're free from all life's fears
But can the blessed on God's mountain
Love you more than I down here

I was raised not to question
Promises the Bible makes
But how could the almighty
Make such a terrible mistake

Did the Lord's illumination
Shine upon you from his throne
When he witnessed my sweet angel
Suffer on the long road home

If there's really no more teardrops
And the streets are paved with gold
Send me down some reassurance
I don't believe what I've been told

If there really is a kingdom
Where you start your life anew
Won't you please somehow convince me
That heaven's good enough for you",Is Heaven Good Enough for You
Allison Moorer,"I've been walking these mean streets
Hard concrete beneath my feet
Ain't found a friendly face among the crowd
The city's like a Christmas tree
A light for every dreamer's dream
But it seems mine has finally burned out

[Chorus]
Long black train, take me home
I've worn out my welcome here, it's time to go
I have to face the music, this just ain't where I belong
Long black train, take me home

I should've known I was mistaken
When I thought that I'd be making
A name for myself in Babylon
Though I've tried to do my best
The suit and ties are not impressed
So with what's left of my pride, I'll carry on

[Chorus]

I'm gonna trade my guitar for a ticket
Then climb aboard and ride you down the track
I know I'm licked, but it's hard to admit it
Maybe someday you can bring me back

[Chorus]

Long black train, take me home",Long Black Train
Allison Moorer,"The moon is full and my arms are empty
All night long I've pleaded and cried
You always said the day that you would leave
Would be a cold day in July

Your bags are packed not a word is spoken
I guess we said everything with good-bye
Time moves so slow and promises get broken
On this cold day in July

Sun's comin' up comin' up down on Main Street
Children shout as they're running out to play
Head in my hands here I am
Standing in my bare feet
Watching you drive away
Watching you drive away

You said that we were gonna last forever 
You said our love would never die 
It looks like spring and 
It feels like sunny weather 
But it's a cold day in July

Sun's comin' up comin' up down on Main Street 
Children shout as they're running out to play 
Head in my hands here I am 
Standing in my bare feet 
Watching you drive away 
Watching you drive away

The moon is full my arms are empty 
All night long how I've pleaded and cried 
You always said the day that you would leave me 
Would be a cold day in July 
Here comes that cold day in July
",The One That Got Away (Got Away with My Heart)
Allison Moorer,"You say the time has come for you to go
Why you've decided this, I'll never know
You say you've lost the love you felt for me
Well, baby, you won't find it if you leave

Pardon me, if I don't understand
How a love like ours can turn out bad
You tell me I'll be fine alone
Without the love I'm leaning on
Well, pardon me, if I don't understand

I can't see how you'll be happy far away
But what's best for you is not for me to say
So I'll try to keep my feelings to myself
But forgive me if I don't do too well

Pardon me, if I don't understand
How a love like ours can turn out bad
You tell me I'll be fine alone
Without the love I'm leaning on
Well, pardon me, if I don't understand

You tell me I'll be fine alone
Without the love I'm leaning on
Well, pardon me, if I don't understand",Pardon Me
Allison Moorer,"I found your bag this morning
Did you pack it by yourself
If you would've asked me
I'd have given you some help

I hate to disappoint you
But I had a hunch
You would soon be leaving
So I beat you to the punch

I'll tell you a secret, baby, I let go first
If I was still holding on, then maybe I'd feel worse
But I seen this day coming, so it don't bother me
I've already set you free

I'm glad you're finally going
But, boy, you took your time
I'd begun to wonder
If you had changed your mind

So you don't have to sneak out
You're not going to let me down
That's already happened
I'm over it by now

I'll tell you a secret, baby, I let go first
If I was still holding on, then maybe I'd feel worse
But I seen this day coming, so it don't bother me
I've already set you free
I've already set you free",Set You Free
Allison Moorer,"(Walter Hyatt)

Tell me, baby
How long I'm gonna cry
How long I'm gonna sigh for you

Tell me, baby
Do you remember the promises you made me
Rolling down the road, with the sky so blue

I'm grieving for you
Oh, I miss you so
Believe me, darling
Oh, you just don't know
I need you and I want you so

Tell me, baby
What are you gonna do
Someday you'll want me, too, I know

When you want me
You better hope that I don't leave you lonely
Rolling down the road, with no place to go

I'm grieving for you
Oh, I miss you so
Believe me, darling
Oh, you just don't know
I need you and I want you so

Tell me, baby
How long I'm gonna cry
How long I'm gonna sigh for you

Tell me, baby
Do you remember the promises you made me
Rolling down the road, with the sky so blue
Rolling down the road, with the sky so blue

",Tell Me Baby
Allison Moorer,"When you left, I never thought I'd say
I'm alright without you anyway
But just because I say the words
Don't mean I think they're true
It's just that it's the best that I can do

I don't go to places you might be
I can't take the chance that we might meet
But just because I've stayed away
Don't mean I wanted to
It's just that it's the best that I can do

Someday I'll do better, but till then
I can't let you know how hurt I've been
I wish I had you back with me
But I won't play on your sympathy
To get you in my arms once again

I admit there are others I have seen
Sometimes I need the company
But just because I'm loving them
Don't mean I'm over you
It's just that it's the best that I can do",Best That I Can Do
Allison Moorer,"Please don't bring me flowers
Tied up in a pretty bow
I'd trade a thousand roses
For just one hand to hold

And I don't want no candy
Sugar hurts my teeth
All I want is you tonight
That'd be really sweet

There's nothing at the five-and-dime
That I really need
Your kiss is the only gift
That means a thing to me

Bring me all your lovin'
That's something you ain't tried
Bring me all your lovin'
And I'll be satisfied

I don't want a poem
Written fancy on a card
I'd rather have ""I love you""
Scribbled on my heart

And I won't wear a new dress
From a downtown store
But wrap me up in your arms
And baby, I'll be yours

There's nothing at the five-and-dime
That I really need
Your kiss is the only gift
That means a thing to me

Bring me all your lovin'
That's something you ain't tried
Bring me all your lovin'
And I'll be satisfied
That's the truth

No, there's nothing at the five-and-dime
That I really need
Your kiss is the only gift
That means a thing to me

Bring me all your lovin'
That's something you can't buy
Bring me all your lovin'
And I'll give you all of mine

Bring me all your lovin'
Throw your presents in the creek
Yeah, bring me all your lovin'
And I'll be tickled pink",Bring Me All Your Lovin'
Allison Moorer,"When the first hint of sunshine
Peeks between the window blinds
And the morning hits my pillow
The sweetest dream is left behind

I'd rather die than face a new day
'Cause I always wake to find
That I'm feeling just as lonely
As the day you said goodbye

Can you feel me reaching for you
In the middle of the night
What I'd give to hold you, darling
Within these arms of mine

Can you feel me reaching for you
In the middle of the night
What I'd give to hold you, darling
Within these arms of mine

All my heartache would be over
If my dream came true one time
Then I wouldn't have to live with
The day you said goodbye

Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye",Day You Said Goodbye
Allison Moorer,"The moment these lips said I'm leaving
I felt in my heart I was wrong
But I told myself I might as well
Since I already spent nights alone

I thought I had put it behind me
Guess that's why I'm so surprised
That my heart started a-racing
When I ran into you tonight

I'm feeling that feeling again
Exactly like I did back then
But darling, only a fool
Would take one more chance with you
There was a good reason why
I had to tell you goodbye
But I can't pretend
It's not love that I'm in
'Cause I'm feeling that feeling again

Now I'm lying here like I used to
Lonesome as a young widowed bride
And just like the old days, before I went my way
A question is burning inside

Were we made for each other
To walk through the fire hand in hand
Well, I'll never know for certain
But I'm feeling that feeling again

I'm feeling that feeling again
Exactly like I did back then
But darling, only a fool
Would take one more chance with you",Feeling That Feeling Again
Allison Moorer,"Children say that words will never harm you
Only sticks and stones will make you cry
But they'll grow up one day and learn the real truth
When the one they love says goodbye

The hardest part of living is loving
'Cause loving turns to leaving every time
And the hardest part of leaving is living
Life is hard when love is so unkind
Life is hard when love is so unkind

I don't trust old sayings any longer
Most are only decorated lies
Absence doesn't make the heart grow fonder
And out of sight don't mean out of mind

The hardest part of living is loving
'Cause loving turns to leaving every time
And the hardest part of leaving is living
Life is hard when love is so unkind
Life is hard when love is so unkind",The Hardest Part
Allison Moorer,"Is it worth it
You gotta wonder
No sane person
Would say it was

It's for certain
We're going under
Things ain't working
Between the two of us

Is it worth it
To go on trying
We keep rehearsing
And getting worse

Let's close the curtain
This act's dying
We did our version
It didn't work

Is it worth
The price we are paying
Is it worth
The damage being done

Is it worth
The both of us staying
If you think so
Then you're the only one

Is it worth it
What are we doing
Let's not be martyrs
For the sake of love

This is a burden
Of our own choosing
It'd be smarter
If we gave up",Is It Worth It
Allison Moorer,"Sorrow, I'm told
Comes and goes
But that ain't what I say

'Cause for me
The misery
Never goes away

It's been like this
Ever since
You told me goodbye

And I've refused
To lose these blues
But it's time I tried

It's time I tried
To mend my broken heart
Dry my eyes
And make a brand new start
I have to heal this hurt I feel
And get you off my mind
It might be hard
But it's time I tried

All I do
Is long for you
When I turn out the lights

'Cause nothing's left
But loneliness
To hold onto at night

I toss and turn
While my heart yearns
For love I've been denied

I can't replace
Your warm embrace
But it's time I tried

It's time I tried
To mend my broken heart
Dry my eyes
And make a brand new start
I have to heal this hurt I feel
And get you off my mind
It might be hard
But it's time I tried
It's time I tried",It's Time I Tried
Allison Moorer,"You've finally gone and done it
Broke it right in two
There's no way you can fix it
So pocket your excuse
Don't tell me that you're sorry
That'll only make it worse
I'm tired of your story
I know it word for word
I make no bones about it
Stupid is as stupid does
I had to learn the hard way
You're a man that I can't trust
If only I'd known sooner
I was gonna be betrayed
I would've left the first time
I ever heard you say
I didn't mean to break your heart
I apologize
If you'll just give me
One more chance
There'll be no next time
I promise I will never break your heart
Again
Again
Again
Right now it's a-hurtin'
But it'll be okay
I'll pick up both the pieces
And be on my way
You know that I love you
Yeah, that's been my mistake
So before I go, let's hear it
Once more for old time's sake
I didn't mean to break your heart
I apologize
If you'll just give me
One more chance
There'll be no next time
I promise I will never break your heart

Allison Moorer,"(Wait, let me get the sweat off my fingers) 

You crawl back tonight saying you miss me
With your tail between your legs
What's going on here ain't no mystery
Still, it's fun watching you beg
Settling down won't come natural
But think it over

I hear you found someone who's true
That she treats you fine
Now that poor girl's love won't do
And you're wanting some of mine
Settling down won't come natural
But think it over

I know why you cheat on me
(Always running 'round and 'round)
Every time I turn my back
(You'll never change)
Every woman loves a bit differently
(But hurts the same)
That's what keeps you going
That's what keeps you trapped

Don't tell me you've learned your lesson
Unless you really want to quit
It takes more than a confession
For an old dog to learn new tricks
Settling down won't come natural
But think it over
Ah ha, think it over",Think It Over
Allison Moorer,"You can't get there from here
I can't live on bread and water
You heard the one about the farmer's daughter
She just needs a little atmosphere
You don't pick your occupation
I didn't ask for this frustration
I need a life and a nice cold beer
But you can't get there from here

If I had time to think about it
I'd build a castle in the yard
For all the things I want so much
Always something I can't touch
But I guess that would be too hard

You can't get there from here
I can't live on bread and water
You heard the one about the farmer's daughter
She just needs a little atmosphere
You don't pick your occupation
I didn't ask for this frustration
I need a life and a nice cold beer
But you can't get there from here

I'm on a road that's going nowhere
Looking for a place that I belong
The wind's pushing me in all directions
But none of them look like home
And you can't get there from here
You can't live on bread and water
You heard the one about the farmer's daughter

No you can't get there from here",Can't Get There From Here
Allison Moorer,"The summer days are gone
Along with you they disappeared
And left me here
Just like the falling leaves
I watched you turn and drift away
Nothing stays
Don't want to face the fall alone
But it's your nature to move on

Is it cold in California
Like I told you it would be
Do you need someone to warm you
Like I warmed you
Is it cold in California
Like it is in Tennessee

Spent the holidays with a man made out of snow
Ho ho ho
Kept on building fires
But they didn't ease the chill
Nothing will
This has been the hardest time
Winter has the longest nights

Is it cold in California
Like I told you it would be
Do you need someone to warm you
Like I warmed you
Is it cold in California
Like it is in Tennessee

I'll count the days until the spring
And hope it brings you back to me

Allison Moorer,"I take a pint of whiskey
And crack open it's lid
I drink the bottle empty
Just like my poor daddy did

No one grows old in this household
We are a dying breed
I take a red and blue one
From my Mama's purse
I wash 'em down with homemade wine
To see what kicks in first
I take after my family

Allison Moorer,"Up 'til now my lucky stars shined brightest in the sky
I was living in the lap of the gods
But miss fortune turned the tables and turned out all the light
Now there's no chance in hell I'll beat the odds

I'm going down
Going down
Down down down
I'm going down

Up 'til now I never looked at what was in the cards
Played fast and loose,
I didn't, didn't give a damn
But a joker who is wild like me can't beat the old graveyard
If he's staring at a dead man's hand
I'm going down
Going down
Down down down
Down down down down
I'm going down
Up 'til now the thought of losing didn't cross my mind
It felt good, so good to gamble with my soul
But what was I a thinking why'd I lay it on the line

Allison Moorer,"Don't you look pretty
Dressed to the nines
Comfortably sitting
On your gold mine
Blood red and blonde
Lipstick and curls
A high-heeled don Juan
Come to mess up my world
All of the ladies
Are watching their backs
The boys thinking maybe
They might stand a chance
Bet every bar you walk in's the same
They don't know who you are
But they sure know your name

Ain't no bombshell wrecking my home
He's all I got he's all I want
Jezebel find someone else
Leave mine alone
Why'd you come calling
On this side of town
A woman who's fallen
And keeps going down
I won't compete with your dirty work
So get back to the street
Before you get hurt

Allison Moorer,"Sometimes in the mornings I wake up devastated that you're gone
It drives me kinda crazy and I tell myself it's been a little long
To still be expecting you to call me up on the phone
I don't like holding on but I can't let go
Sometimes a photograph of you will take my breath away
I don't think that time's a healer no matter what folks say
How can years fly by so fast and breaks in a heart mend so slow
I don't like holding on but I can't let go
Sometimes I'm in a room full of people when old lonely sits by me
And it makes me sad to realize that unlike you he won't ever leave
I wish I had some kind of pill to take this feeling from my bones
I don't like holding on but I can't let go
",Let Go
Allison Moorer,"You feel it now
But it won't last
Without a doubt
It's bound to pass

And I'll say
I told you so

Allison Moorer,"I apologize
I should've kept it hidden
Under wraps and out of sight
At least in the beginning
But I wanted you to see
What you meant to me
Turns out that wasn't smart
A sleeve is no place for a heart
Wish I could take back
the secret that I told you
But it's too late for that
Now you know the whole truth
Three stupid little words
You never should have heard
But I let down my guard
A sleeve is no place for a heart
Take one last look before it's gone
It's time I put it back where it belongs
Next time I will know
Not to let my feelings show
I'll keep them in the dark

Allison Moorer,"In nineteen and double-aught
A harlot who was hot to trot
Gave a fine little bijou to the world
With a blacksmith for a makeshift doc
In a cathouse far from camelot
Her gold mine brought to bed a baby girl
When the child screamed from life's first slap
The bawd said kid get used to that
You'll never meet a day that isn't cruel
Then she wrapped her babe in a petticoat
Grabbed a bottle and made a toast
Here's to my gorgeous bastard ruby jewel
And the man at the piano played a tune
And everybody sang and danced in the saloon
Except ruby, no not ruby, ruby jewel
Reared among the guttersnipe
While her mama puffed the chinese pipe
The salad days for ruby didn't last
Forced to work and pay her dues
Inside that poor man's moulin rouge
The snot-nosed kid had to grow up fast
Night and day she'd toil and sweat
While brothel patrons placed their bets
On who would be the first to break her in
Then one night the madam screams
Ruby get to room thirteen
There's someone there who thinks you're quite a gem
And the man at the piano played a tune
And everybody sang and danced in the saloon
Except ruby no not ruby ruby jewel
In done up hair and a borrowed dress
She climbed the stares scared to death
Said a prayer and tip-toed through the door
But on deaf ears her prayer fell
Cause through her tears she stared at hell
Standing there in nothing but his drawers
She recognized the whiskered chin
Bloodshot eyes and foul-mouthed grin
He was the man who wore the silver star
She tried to turn around and run
But he pulled out his big six gun
And said whore you won't get very far
And the man at the piano played a tune
And everybody sang and danced in the saloon
Except ruby, no not ruby, ruby jewel
Ruby jewel woke up in bed
A crimson pool between her legs
Naked as the day that she was born
But lying there next to him
Made her wish she hadn't been
If this was all that living had in store
Making sure he was asleep
She quietly got to her feet
Found his gun and aimed it 'tween his eyes
She kept it there 'til he came to
So he could stare down the barrel too
Pulled the trigger once and watched him die
And the man at the piano played a tune
And everybody sang and danced in the saloon
Except ruby no not ruby ruby jewel
On a rainy night in nineteen-twelve
Locked inside the town's new jail
Ruby carved a message in the stone
When morning came hacks led her out
In ankle chains right through the crowd
Who waited in the mud to watch the show
They walked her up the gallows steps
But the rope around her neck
Dropped the trap as all the watchers cheered
But on the wall of her cell
In a tiny scrawl and misspelled
Were the words ruby jewel was here
And the man at the piano played a tune
And everybody sang and danced in the saloon
Except ruby, no not ruby, ruby jewel

Allison Moorer,"If the moon could conceal
How it feels when it shines
And the stars could disguise
The beauty the skies reveal
Then the fire I try to hide in my heart
Would remain out of sight
Here with you in the dark

Let's steal the sun
Before tomorrow comes
Daybreak might take this all away
Let's be thieves
And rob the east of morning's light
Let's steal the sun
Before it steals tonight

Oh how I've missed
Being kissed tenderly
Lips so soft and sweet
Touching my cheek like this
What else can I do
But choose to give in
The only way I can lose
Is if this feeling ends

Before tomorrow comes

Allison Moorer,"I'm skipping across the stars
Hopping from moon to moon
Higher than a kite's been before
Made my way to Mars
Venus and Neptune
If I was scared of heights
I ain't no more

Up this high in outerspace
Old cloud nine looks commonplace
Floating way down there in the blue
Up this high at heaven's door
Worlds collide and comets soar
Your love lets me fly up this high

A lot of astronauts have left the planet earth
But they use rocketships to kiss the sky
I don't have what they got
But I sail the universe
Everytime your lips are kissing mine

Up this high in outerspace
Old cloud nine looks commonplace
Floating way down there in the blue
Up this high at heaven's door
Worlds collide and comets soar
Your love lets me fly up this high

Back when I was green
You could find me chooglin' smoke
But when I got off I never left the ground
Now you can't find me
Unless you have a telescope
And I don't want to ever come back down

Up this high in outerspace

Floating way down there in the blue
Up this high at heaven's door

Allison Moorer,"I know a magical place to get a taste of a little heaven on earth
It's just a watering hole but many a soul go there to quench their thirst
When my whistle's dry there's nowhere that I can think of I'd rather be
It's called the blue moon tap room, yessirree, yessirree
It has thirty cent draws and that's because they only cost Tony two-bits
See it's Tony's joint and he makes it a point to let every poor bum get lit
He's a drunk's patron saint and he won't hesitate to fix you some supper for free
It's called the blue moon tap room, yessirree, yessirree
Each morning at eight it opens it's gates for all my buddies and me
With our foots on the rail and our buckets of ale we tell stories no one believes
We spit and we cuss at the lives that left us then toast to our freedom with glee
It's called the blue moon tap room, yessirree, yessirree
I sit tight each night til they turn up the lights empty my last one and leave
Then squint my eyes at the dawn in the sky as people walk by on the street
God only knows where it is they go but there's only one place for me
It's called the blue moon tap room, yessirree, yessirree

Allison Moorer,"When my liquor cabinet is empty
And the local package store is closed
I am paid a visit by an enemy

If I don't score again

Allison Moorer,"It wears on my patience when I talk to those deejays
At the corporation station they slather on false praise
Even though I'm slow I know no radio will give my record spins
Lean on me all you want to, I'll break before I bend

Way up in those ivory towers with gold records on the walls
All the big wigs got the power but they ain't got the balls
The desk bound clowns that run this town
Have watered down the sound just like their gin
Lean on me all you want to, I'll break before I bend

Hell yeah I'd love to make it but I suck at playing games
I'd rather starve than fake it for a little taste of fame
It's wrong to be a doggone pawn singing songs that make
You yawn for payments on a long mercedes benz
Lean on me all you want to, I'll break before I bend

She don't make a sound 
I don't know how she does it 

One handed her a coffee cup 
One to get the babies in the car 
Cross your fingers, crank it up, hope and pray the piece of shit'll start 
Singing with the radio so she don't fall apart 
It's just a broken heart 
I don't know how she does it

And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere

But clouds got in my way

From up and down, and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall

As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

But now it's just another show

And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

From give and take, and still somehow

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say ""I love you"" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they tell me that I've changed
Well somethings lost but somethings gained
In living every day

The mystery of childbirth, of childhood itself

Why must we pray screaming?
Why must not death be redefined?

And whirl on a pane of glass

The hands of he and the promise that she is blessed among women

Always a sad refrain
And a melody runs through her veins

Sifting through remains

And it ain't alright

Allison Moorer,"I close my eyes and I listen
And try to get out of the way
But when I look out the window
I see his face
Is it him that I hear laughing
Taunting me making me blush
Acting like he knows my secrets
Why won't he hush

The crow in the yard is trying to tell me something
I see him out there trying to catch my eye

He's not the magnificent raven
He caws a much creepier caw
So comfortable there in his murder
Don't he know it all
So why won't he just give me the message
What's the worst news he could bring
And I make a mess when I'm guessing
About anything

The crow in the yard is trying to tell me something
I see him out there trying to catch my eye
Black as the night he shines like a light on nothing
Ain't no use in trying to hide

Oh child
Oh child

I guess a crow in the yard
Is better than bats in the belfry",Crows
Allison Moorer,"July nineteen-eighty-one
Alabama summer sun
Sissy got her fishing pole
Went down to the honey hole
Greasy fiery frying pan
Viola grabbed it with her hand
It burned so bad her skin it peeled
There I saw the truth revealed

Watermelon tastes so good
Bare feet on the cool hardwood
Summer dresses Nanny made
Cut off blue jeans torn and frayed
Swinging on the barnyard gate
It don't get dark till after eight
Run inside a kiss and hug
Wrapped up in my mama's love

Firefly whispered in my ear
She said let's get outta here
Fly down to the creek with me
There's something you gotta see
The stars come out and glow so bright
That's why I don't mess with morning light

They make me wanna rock 'n roll

Can I steal one more tomorrow

Hear my call

What will last what's gone forever

Simple things you just can't seem to keep a hold on

Well hold on 'cause it's gonna feel good when it stops hurting

Does the blues have you convinced the end is certain
Well be strong 'cause it's gonna feel good when it stops hurting

Gonna feel so good
It's gonna feel good
It's gonna feel good
When it stops hurting

Do the nights get darker longer are they cold
Summer chills then early frost as you get older

When loves lead to nowhere
When rights go wrong
When dreams turn into nightmares

I got no money and I’m losing time
I’ve got nobody in my arms tonight
All I got left is the bright side
Oh, I’ve got left is the bright side

Making sure everything falls in line
Maybe you could just unwind,
Crossing every T will cross your eyes
What 'll you do when you finally see
All your plans aren’t guaranteed
Gotta get stupid sometimes

Oh and get a little out of your mind
When ups gonna go down
When loves lead to nowhere
When rights go wrong
When dreams turn into nightmares

I throw my hands up cause I got no fight
I started to live when I realized
All I’ve got left is the bright side
All I’ve got left is the bright side

Ain’t no doctor, doctor that can help me
I don’t need a quick fix
I’m sitting in a dark room and
I’m feelin’ for a light to wish
And everybody’s had a night like this

It’s when ups gonna go down
When roads lead to nowhere
Where rights go wrong
And dreams turn into nightmares

A tune that I just can't explain

We'll clear our throats and sing along
There's nothing like a leaving song
But all is for the best, you know
And I will go, so let me go

Let me go

You were the one
I wanted more than you could give
You were the one
Who said we couldn't live like this
You were the one
Who made the plans before we landed

All is for the best, you know
So why won't you just let me go?

Let me go",Let Me Go
Allisons,"I'm sitting in the railway station. 
Got a ticket to my destination. 
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand. 
And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band. 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 
Ev'ry day's an endless stream 
Of cigarettes and magazines. 
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories 
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be, 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 

Tonight I'll sing my songs again, 
I'll play the game and pretend. 
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity 
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me. 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 
Silently for me.",Homeward Bound
Allister,"I picked up the phone and said hello
When I picked up the phone I didn't know
This girl would be making my world go round
We talked for an hour or two and she said
""hey kid I would love to see you""
And I said that would be so cool

she's so far away
She's so far away from me
I wanna see this girl
Fall in love with me
And write a song about her
On our new LP
I wanna hold her tight
And keep her warm at night
And tell her
That she's the one for me
She's the one for me

now I want her to understand
That I just want to hold her hand
But we're a million miles apart
I wrote her a letter yesterday
To say how perfect we could be
'cause she already stole my heart

she's so far away
She's so far away from me
I wanna see this girl
Fall in love with me
And write a song about her
On our new LP
I wanna hold her tight
And keep her warm at night
And tell her
That she's the one for me
She's the one for me

Just pictures on my wall
It's not that much but it'll do
My friends all laugh
They have no symptahy
I guess I'll be the last one to screw

they say I'm scared
And unprepared

That's why I've wasted all my time
Being with a selfish girl like you
There's something that I've gotta say
That's why I can't go on this way
Being hung up over you

Cause I don't want to be the one
You come to when you're crying on the phone
And I don't want to be the one

I was with a girl who tried to sleep with my best friend
We both took comfort in each others messy lives
Finding warmth on that cold November night
We swore it'd be years before we brought that on again
Days later you said that we should be more
Than just friends
I let my guard down cause the feelings were so strong
But acted stupid and that's when he came along

It's been so long
I should just move on
There's other fish in the sea
But I keep hoping that you'll swim back to me

We'd sneak out and go swimming late at night
You're one of few who can say they've seen me cry
You got my quirkiness and awkward sense of humor
We shared Simpson quote and started made up rumors

If night turned into day you'd hide me from your mom
I could never fight with you cause you were never wrong
This time especially the blame is all on me
If I'd not screwed things up I wonder where we'd be

One day for no reason I broke our date
So you made other plans that day
And that's when you met him
And why you're still with him today

What I should do
Should I cash the check
And trade in what I thought I knew

To push me around and tell me what to do
I know there's a time and place where you can call the shots

And I can't explain what I'm going through inside
But I would turn away the world
Just to have her here with me tonight

Everything feels right
It won't be easy

Then I'd tell you everything
I'd probably say that you've been on my mind

Smoking cigarettes to play
Off all the butterflies I had inside

And now I think that you should know
That you've got everything
That I've wanted for so damn long
And that I wouldn't hesitate to trade away everything
If you tell me that I'm not wrong
So know I think that you should know
That I've been waiting for you

Since we sat underneath the stars
As I held you in my arms
Killing just another summer night

It's funny how the best things happen sometimes
And how I'll always remember those endless nights
But don't forget I regret the fact that I have to leave you
Right as the best part starts

These are thoughts from the past not to pick my brain
And now I feel like screaming to the world
Cause this highways going nowhere
And the lines have all been blurred
By the rain that's falling down in front of me
So I clear the windshield just to find
Another cross to mark the passing of a life
It's a crystal clear reminder
That all things come to an end
And I wonder when that end will come for me

[Chorus]
When the lights go down
And the clocks time out
And the bells just don't chime anymore
Is it tragedy that we can't see
What lies on the other side of every single smile

I've been asking myself for the third straight night
If there's truth in the writings that shape our lives
Now I feel like screaming to the world
Do these sermons run in circles
Are they spoken by design
To erase the thoughts of insecurity
And maybe were just never meant to find
The answer to the question we've all kept inside
Give me something to believe in
Give me anything at all
Cause right now this world just feels like its too small

Not tonight
I won't back down without a fight
I won't cry

When they move so fast 
And lightning 
Except the odds are growing

Are whispers inside my head 
The echoes of self defense 

So how many times will it take 
To cover up the past mistakes 
And hide behind a crying you face of shame 
And how many nights will I hide 
And blink under the blackened skies 
I've cursed out so many times 

Its biting 
When the cold wind blows through weathered eyes 
And blistered skin 
It's quiet now 
It's like the calm before the raging violence of the storm begins 
And when this comes crashing down 
I'll fall harder than before 
I'll start this all over now 

So how many times will it take 
To cover up the past mistakes 
And hide behind a crying face of shame 
And how many nights will I hide 
And blink under the blackened skies 
I've cursed out so many times before 

I'll beg for the ending or just for forgiveness 
I'll wait in the shadows of a battle I'm close to losing

When the hero comes in last
Who is winning?

Well I am tired of feeling confused
And lest my words be construed
I can't separate what's real, but I know that I believe in you

There you go, out on the pavement walking alone
They could name a star after you and you'd still be complaining

And now it's clear
Now that you know why I wanted you here
There's a southern constellation that shines with your name on it

And I won't fly until the day that I die
But we can't keep out dreams in jars so I'll keep yours close to mine

In my old university car
We had the windows down for our recon
Though it was so hot that you burned your arm
It was the tail and over summer
And the heat washed in with the breeze
And you were searching something to sing to

As the radio played another terrible song
But lucky for me, you found the tape with Tallulah on
And it's been a long time
Since I've seen all my old friends
But I really love my new friends
I feel I've known them a long while

Then last summer you wrote me a letter
On the back of a surf magazine
You said you didn't have any paper
And maybe you wondered what could have been
So I sent you a postcard from Berlin of a fatman eating a sausage
And hear the fact that I was hiding

As the DJ played another terrible song
But lucky for us, we found a bar with the metals on
And it's been a long time

And I'm wondering if I've already met all the people that'll mean something

Used to brush them away

Allstar Weekend,"Every night I go to bed
And take a trip inside my head
And I wonder exactly what my purpose is
Do I live to see one hundred
Am I rich
Or am I poor

I wanna take a journey to the end of my life
'Cause I just wanna see what it's like
Am I loved
Am I hated
In your face
Or understated
How old will I be when I die
Do I turn out alright

Is my fate up to me
Or is it run by a computer
Will my kids go to school or stay at home
In the future
Is there peace
Is there war

A chance to put it right before it goes wrong
Certain things I say that I regret
And erase them all
Erase them all
Save my friends so they don't get hurt
Get the mustard stain off my favorite shirt
Have more vision than a crystal ball

Allure,"It was an early summer day
But it seems like just yesterday
When mama looked right in my face
And told me she was going away
If I could count all the tears that I crid
I'd be empty and lost inside
So I'll try to find a smile
And hold my head up high
Moma said
Don't cry
I'm going away Up high
Don't be afraid
Be strong
Just keep on holding on
Mama said
Don't cry
Dry all the tears
From your eyes
Don't be afraid
Be strong
Just keep on holding on
So young, but yet so wise
So much beauty was in her eyes
No one could quite explain
Just why she had to face the pain
But when the day comes and hits your time
Only God knows the reason why
She was my angel, my light, and my friend
But one day we'll be together again
But now that I know
She has gone away
Gone away, gone away
There were days when I wish that I could run away
Run away, run away
And if I could there would be another summer day
Summer day summer day
When I could see my mother's face again
Cause mama said
Don't cry
I'm goin away, way up high
Don't be afraid
Be strong 
Just keep on holding on
Cause mama said
Baby don't ya cry
Just dry all the tears

Should I surrender when you pursue me
You think a man don't have heart and soul
When a hand's that good, anybody will fold

But the heart regulates the devotion
Love is floatin' in a sky blue ocean
Think about it
Feel the motion, young queen
It reminds me of a smoothed out movie scene
Two bodies intertwined on the screen
Everybody makes love in their dreams
But this is real, know what I mean
Passion is the way of the world
Electricity when boy meets girl
And making love is the key
A burning flame that will last eternally

You should know that I'm here for you
As long as you see me through 
I would give all I have just to be with you
Don't you see honey it could be me and you

And they make me strong 
Hear the sound 
Won't you take my hand 
Just a smile and your embrace 
I can do no wrong 
Turn around say you understand 

Holding you I fear no evil 
I can feel the love inside you 
Holding you holding you loving you 
Holding you could be so easy 
I can feel your arms around me 
Holding you holding you loving you 

When the daylight fades away 
And I'm on my way

Can we really feel the way people say we do 
Won't you find you're here to keep me warm

Allyn Ferguson,"War, war, war, war, war, war, war
On a silent shore
I spoke to god
The sun is down
Assemble the great pandemonium
War

One more down by the brook of Babylon
One more down in accordance with my fate
One long drift across the lake of Avalon
One more trip that I must create

And my eyes sweep a shore
That was always there
A blood red line
Through the sonisphere
I can't resolve where it's coming from
I sense it's the great pandemonium

One more, just one more
Just one, just one more day
One more day by the pits of hell
Just one more when even yesterday was too late
One more thought that I have to sow
One last trick that you can't debate

War

On a silent shore
I confronted fear
I spoke to god
But he wasn't there
The sun is down
And the war begun
Assemble the great pandemonium

Growls
Break down
Got to break down
Break down

And my eyes sweep a shore
That was always there
A blood red line
Through the sonisphere
I can't resolve where it's coming from
I sense it's the great pandemonium

On a silent shore
I confronted fear
I spoke to god
But he wasn't there
The sun is down

Assemble the great pandemonium

Just one, just one, just one more day
Just one, just one more

Dans son écrin, dans son écrin

Chante trop loin de moi, loin de moi

And he's sailing somewhere on the sea
I got the bell bottom blues cause I'm crazy 'bout a sailor
And I don't know when he's coming back to me
I shake my head and refuse when the fellers come a calling
And they want to take me on a date
I got the bell bottom blues while the other girls are falling
I just sit around the living room and wait

I wonder if he's looking at the same moon I'm looking at
Every night I'm looking at the moon
I know that if he's praying for the same thing I'm praying for
We'll be together soon

Alma Cogan,"Once in a while,
Will you try
To give one little thought to me,
Though someone else may be 
Nearer your heart?

Once in a while,
Will you dream
Of the moments
I shared with you,
Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

In love's smoldering ember,
One spark may remain.
If love still can remember,
That spark may burn again.

I know that I'll
Be contented with 
Yesterday's memory,
Knowing you think of me
Once in a while.

Alma Cogan,"Volare, oh oh
Cantare, oh oh oh oh
Let's fly way up to the clouds
Away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like bird of a feather, a rainbow together we'll find

Volare, oh oh

It would bore me terrifically,too,

And all I got to show is the muscle in my arm,
Blisters on my feet, and the callous on my hand,
And I'm a-goin' to Montana to throw the houlihan

Put it on my pony, lead him out of his stall
Tie my bones to his back, turn our faces to the west,

Almeda Berkey,"""Romance is a game for fools""
I used to say
A game I thought I'd never play
""Romance is a game for fools""
I said and grinned
Then you passed by
And here am I
Throwing caution to the wind

Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head.
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

Mm-mm-mm-mm
Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Fools rush in where wise men never, never, never go
Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
Ah, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Just open up your heart and let this fool rush on in
Just open up your heart because I-I-I-I-I-I-I am coming in
Open up your heart and let this fool rush in!!",Fools Rush In

The key to everything, everybody here in America
Is the money.
Some say that it's the root of all evil;
Brings wars and other cells of upheaval.
Leaves family in the streets with nothing to eat;
Little baby boys and girls
No shoes on their feet;
All the men who leave home dying in the war zones
And the women do it all they own.
It reminds me of the ghettos right here
And the hoods that I see,
Everywhere that I've been in the is country.
Stop bailing out the banks and give the Franklins to me
I guess my piece of the pie ain't free, can you free.

Her daddy was a very rich man
He told me, ""Son, proceed with caution""
If you wanna take my little girl's hand

See money that I have might be good for some
And down right danger to another
And little Miss Fortune is sure to become
Unfortunately just like her mother

Hey he said, ""Back when I was young and dumb, I had a choice""
Before me and mama Fortune got wed, mmm
Between riding in a bus or driving a new Rolls Royce yeah
And I decided what I wanted was the bread, hey 

But the problem with having everything you want, mmm
Is you never really know what you need, hey
Now Miss Fortune is a spoilt little débutante
And it's my fault so I suggest you take my heat

So you met my little girl Miss Fortune
And you know that I'm a very rich man
I told you to precede with caution
If you wanna take my little girl's hand

See money that I have might be good for some
And down right danger to another
And little Miss Fortune is sure to become
Unfortunately just like her mother, hey

Well I thanked Miss Fortune's father
Said I understand
But you're trying to talk me down
Yes you are

Listen here,
You ain't have to bother
'Cause I'm a real strong man
I'm sure I can turn your daughter around

See what she needs is someone who can take control
Let the girl know her place and how to play her role
Tell her all the money in the world cannot replace her soul
Hell she needs is stop acting like twelve years old

Well she put no ring on her finger
Everything started to change
And I looked at myself in the mirror
You know I was looking strange

She had me out every day spending money
On all kinds of ridiculous things
See I forget what life was all about
Little Miss Fortune was to blame

So I married this girl Miss Fortune
Whose daddy was a very rich man
And even though he told me take caution
I still took his little girl's hand

See money don't do everybody the same 
And is down right danger to a brother
And little Miss Fortune surely became
Unfortunately just like her mother, hey

You gotta watch out for Miss Fortune
Brothers you must proceed with caution
Don't let lady luck pass you by, no
And might as well give good grace a try

All I wanted was a little dance with lady luck
But she won't give me a chance
What I could use is some good old grace
But she refuses to show her face

I tvojih reci pred put bez povratka...
Drugovi odlazim, dobro pamtite ono sto see you reci sad,
Zivot je kao predivan san, brzo se prekine.

Novembar, iznad nas kisni oblaci sazvezdje prekrili,
Necujno, jedna zvezda je svoj kratak san odsanjala...

Sve bajke sad daleke su,
Svi snovi prazni sad postali su,
Neka tisina se davno uvukla you nas.

I mozda nas gledas sad ti,
Mozda se smejes sa zvezdama svim,
Vidim ti oci-zvezdani sjaj bez granica.

Bili smo drugovi, iste snove smo brzbrizno sanjali,
Leteli na krilima vecnosti do sazvezdja.
Slutili nismo mi da ces vecno you sazvezdju ostati,
Neka te nase zvezde sad cuvaju tu umesto nas...

Vecni sjaj nek dosegne sve delove svemira,
Jedan tren nek zastane sve.
Do sazvezdja tada mladosti jedne nek cuje se glas...

Are ringing through my opened ears 
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love, which
Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

Jai Guru Deva.
Jai Guru Deva.

Alonzo,"J'ai fait mes diez en diez 31 diez 
Je donne tout quand je rap ou quand je baise 
Loin de nos rêve on vie comme on crève 
On se met des vodkas pour avoir le salaire à 30 barres
Un pied dans le rap l'autre dans les soucis
Anti Sarkozy la rue c'est mon sosie
Petit je voulais la vie de rêve comme Tony
Un chien errant et si tu casse mon plan woulah je te casse les dents 
Vous savez se que j'ai enduré le cadre immatriculé
Je suis le bitume avec un flow d'enculé
J'ai trop galéré pour laisser passer ma chance
Donc moi et ma bande on met a l'amende on vient clasher la France
Ils comprennent pas oukoi
On les fait flipper comme un braquage
Les flics me collent à la peau comme un tatouage
Je représente les gars de la rue
L égalité je n'y crois pas comme un suicide en garde a vue
C'est pour les bon et mauvais garçons la main dans le caleçon

Change de pute comme de voiture de location
De Paris a Marseille du shit dans les baskets

Qui veut me couper les vivres alors que j'ai rien vu de la vie
Qui veut m'empêcher de faire du cash et mettre bien la famille
Tu sais se que je pense a mon âge on est tous barge
On veut tout ce qu'on a pas pour ensuite prendre le large
Qui veut me couper les vivres alors que j'ai rien vu de la vie
Qui veut m'empêcher de faire du cash et mettre bien la famille
Tu sais se que je pense a mon âge on est tous barge
On veut tout ce qu'on a pas pour ensuite prendre le large

Les jaloux parlent comme leur mères dans les cuisines
Faudrait leur mettre du scotch sur la bouche a ces Miskine
Je leur souhaite même un longue vie qu'on se retrouve le vendredi
Devant la course divine qu'on l'élimine
J'ai voulu faire un lâcher de colombes
J'en trouvais pas alors j'ai pris des pigeons que j'ai repeins a la bombe
Le commercial ou le bon
La bouteille pleine ou le fond
C Alonz ca bégaye pas un daron
Ça veut des ronds et pas de chèques car je meurs demain
Je crache pas le venin
Car la musique m'a soulevé en cours pour le matin
Mon parcours appartient au passé
Mon discours terre a terre amour appartient au quartier
Ne crois pas tellement (?) l' Afrique 
Qui se sont enfoncé deux doigts dans la gorge depuis que j'entends chanté leur rejets
É oué ils ont construits des paranoïaques dépressifs sans résine qui ne savent pas aimer
Soigne le chagrin a l'aspirine c'est l'époque
Non non t'a pas rêvé tu as bien entendu chanté lé coq papé

Qui veut me couper les vivres alors que j'ai rien vu de la vie
Qui veut m'empêcher de faire du cash et mettre bien la famille

Qui veut m'empêcher de faire du cash et mettre bien la famille
Tu sais se que je pense a mon âge on est tous barge
On veut tout ce qu'on a pas pour ensuite prendre le large

J'ai des coudes planté dans le dos
Le quartier mon bras droit parle pas marche droit comme un rail de coke
Fils posé sur le ciment les doigts plein de Glock
Les journées sont longues 
La night est hallucinante
On tient les murs potos putin c'est nul
Alors on fait des tunes en manque de sexe on se tient les burnes
Pendant que nos mère sont aux arrêt de buis en tchador
Les affiches sont remplis de putes qui posent pour Christian Dior
Sors dehors!

Les hommes se font belles dans les chiottes
Ils roulent en Benz' et prennent d'la drogue
Sales époque

Ma mère me dit toujours « T'es rien sans la santé »
Elle doit s'douter que j'dois la doser
La pute de Marie-Jeanne veux m'tuer
Elle a jurée fidélité à Iblis, que la jeunesse glisse
Garde tes forces
Si ça frappe en soirée comment on fait?
On boit la Poliakov, comment on fait?
La merde on va pas la chercher, elle vient nous trouver
Tractions, dips, alter, l'été arrive
Les enfants de la Terre-mère sont au développé-couché
Tu soulèves combien papé?
J'vois qu'tu as pris mais faits pas la sexy avec les cochons de la nuit
Ta famille elle est à plat-ventre
J'veux pas acheter ton Audi même si tu changes la calandre
Yomi dans l'Queens
Elle rêve de château à Fomboni-city
Dans la blouse piece
Alors je retrousse mes manches pour et mange tout dans ma discipline
Les magazines ou l'usine?
Et alors? Tant que y a de la viande dans ma cuisine
J'sors plus bling-bling, j'sais que dans l'quartier c'est la merde
Et quand y a moyen de montrer, on fait pas les choses à moitié
La richesse c'est le coeur
Le courage c'est les couilles

Effet miroir, effet miroir, effet miroir, effet miroir
Dans cette sale époque

Pendant qu'les locataires veulent être propriétaire
Ceux qui roulent en Roadster veulent voler en Hélicoptère
La démesure tue l'esprit, même la façon d'être
La façon de paraître aux yeux du monde, la façon de naître
La façon de poser son regard sur une femme
La façon de se connaître avec son frère quand y a les flammes
L'apparence c'est trop traître, trop bref
Marseille pleure ses morts et prie pour ses frères qui attendent une greffe
Tu es trop voyant tu nuis, tu es trop absent on t'oublie
""Voyou"" rime pas avec ""Vaillant""
Je n'sais que faire parler mes 23 ans
J'ai l'haleine d'résine, le respect des grands
Depuis la bouteille de consigne moi je meurt tout l'temps
Quand j'pense à mon père j'ai la gamberge âgée
Quand t'es naufragé personne nage
Quitte à laisser la Rolex et la Virex pour être plus léger
La vie c'est l'chantier, j'rap le mortier pour le béton armé
Trop d'choses à changer dans mon comportement
Ecrire me permet de suspendre mes mille et une erreurs dans l'temps

Marseille c'est hood story, que ça vend des joke
Que ça traîne au bloc, allume ta clope avec un Glock
Allume l'époque avec mes potes en voiture Glock, hou
Consommer c'est bien beau mais au budget ça fait des trous
Que ça soit dans le rock, le reggae, la techno ou le hip-hop

Pour te cacher ma peine mama, parait-il qu'on s'adapte au choses qui ne changent pas
Ta vie n'est pas la mienne et ma vie c'est pas la même
Je m’en rends compte à chaque fois que je vois Kenza qui sera bientôt collégienne
Avoir une fille mama c'est trembler de peur
Qu'un jour elle se maquille mama pour un gros menteur
Je suis comme ça car je connais les hommes
Ils pensent mal alors j’te parle avant que l'un de nous deux s'en aille
Sur ton autorité et tes valeurs, ta foi en ton créateur, ta force, ton cœur
Tu es mon père et ma mère

On dit qu'on n’envoie pas les femmes à la guerre
Dis-moi de quelle guerre tu parles, chaque jour est une lutte pour nos mères
Femmes soldats, elles portent le poids du monde dans le cœur sur Terre
Chaque jour est une peur de la perdre

Elle se met en première ligne quand il se fait envahir par le diable
L'oxygène c'est la madre yeah mes trois enfants aimez votre madre

Aux mères de familles nombreuses et de familles malheureuses
Veuves ou divorcées, secrètement amoureuses
A celles qui prennent des cachets en fin de mois quand tombe la douloureuse
Esclaves de Cofidis pour des meubles
A toutes celles qui se privent pour faire briller leurs gosses
A toutes celles qui ont des rides, qui tiennent encore leur poste
Aux jeunes mamans qui éduquent la prochaine génération
A toutes celles qui ont vu mourir leur petit nourrisson
Aux mères de mes amis qui me voient comme leur fils
A tous leurs sacrifices, à toutes leurs blanches nuits
Sous votre autorité et vos valeurs, votre foi en votre créateur
Votre force, votre cœur vous êtes nos pères et nos mères

Pardonne-moi, pardonne-moi pour tout le mal que je t'ai fait
Et les enfants, respectez nos mères
Respectez nos mères parce que tous les jours elles se battent
Elles se battent pour nous
Moi mon paradis c'est ma mère, mon argent c'est ma mère
Toutes les souffrances que j'endure c'est pour ma mère
Nos pères ils partent on vous pardonne mais nos mères on ne vous oubliera jamais
Parce que le paradis se trouve sous les pieds de nos mères
Mon père c'est ma mère, mon père c'est ma mère

J'ai des priorités, faut changer la garde-robe
Tuez l’animal, j’veux un nouveau cuir, j’aime trop la mode
J’ai tendance à juger mon autre à son physique
Connaitre le cœur, c’est prendre le temps et le temps c’est un tas de fric
C’est un tas d’arbres abattus, c’est du bois, de l’oxygène, c’est chimique

J’ai soufflé mes trente bougies
J’ai perdu au moins trente frères
J’entends chanter le Uzi
Les paroles, je les connais par cœur
Même quand on fait rien, on meurt pour rien
Un petit peut te hagar
Grandes familles grandes histoires
Plus de coups d’pompes que d’coups d’main
WAllah on est lâches
Y’a que quand on pleure qu’on se cache
On frime même quand on est recherchés
Y’a-t-il encore quelqu’un de censé?
Fuck l'euro!
Tout ça nous empêche d'faire l'odo
Marseille c’est une grande chasse à l'homme
Allah y rahmo, Allah y rahmo
Au feu rouge, un coup d’feu résonne
J’pense à la daronne
Au comptoir y’a Lucifer
Un ancien boit sa bière
Et y’a les mecs des alentours qui cherchent ton frère
La drogue a fait connaître le quartier
Les petites sœurs sont excitées
Le mot “respect” est mort à la guerre
Ils prétendent ne pas craindre l’Enfer
Alors, alors, combien on en a vu qui serrent?
Qui parlent seuls assis par terre
J’ai mis au monde des enfants
Dans une ville endiablée
J’aperçois mes cheveux blancs
J’espère mourir avant l’dernier
Quel frère passera pas l’hiver?
Pour un regard tu peux y rester
À qui je dois de l’argent?
C’est quand qu’on se met à prier?
J’te jure qu’on se gâche
J’sais même plus si c’est du rap que j’te crache
Nos pères vieillissent donc hospitalisés
On a du mal à se maîtriser
J’perds mes mots
On est rien sur Terre, fais pas le gros
Comporte-toi comme un homme

'Nous reste pas beaucoup d’temps mamé
On est que de passage

Elle a fait des sacrifices
Il a fini aux Baumettes
La prison ça rend pas service
Il ressort, il met son survêt’
Son mari va la quitter
Pour cette pute de serveuse
On vit dans une ville hantée
Où les apparences sont trompeuses
WAllah que c’est hard
Déménage prends ta famille bombarde
Les muslims font des rappels pour nous calmer
Les CRS sont à l’entrée
Khey c’est chaud
À dire qu’au bled ils donneraient leur peau
Pour venir à Baltimore, eh, c’est le zoo, c’est le zoo
Y’a des rugissements qui résonnent
J’crois qu’c’est la daronne
Paix à nos daronnes
Elles souffrent nos daronnes

Alpa Gun,"Ich spreche heute Klartext, Alpa Gun der Punisher
Mach mir kein' auf hart, wenn wenn du draußen läufst mit Bodyguards
Alles kommt zurück, Caney, vierte Platte und ich fliege
Ich bin jetzt erwachsen und hab keine Zeit für Rumgespiele
Ich musste viel zu oft bemerken, dass ihr mich nur bremst
Caney, Vertrauen ist ein Wort, an dem du dich verbrennst
Manchmal wird es richtig eng und du musst bemerken
Wie die meisten Menschen dich nicht kenn', Bruder, ja, so ist der Mensch
Ich kenn' das alles, also laber mich nicht zu
Ich war geradezu verflucht, denn mein Karma war nie gut, Caney
Alles kommt zurück und genauso tu' ich's heute auch
So viele Falsche Brüder nutzten meine Träume aus
Ich geh' mein Weg und hoffe, dass der Neid im Keim erstickt
Wenn Alper Abi redet, haben deutsche Rapper Schweigepflicht
Guck, alles kommt zurück, die guten und die schlechten Taten
Am jüngsten Tag muss hier jeder seine Rechnung zahlen

Ihr wart nie fair zu mir, ihr wolltet, dass ich nichts erreiche
Ihr habt eine Konkurrenz in mir gesehen und hattet Schiss
Ich brauche niemanden von euch, ich mach das jetzt alleine
Heute könnt ihr lachen, aber glaub mir, alles kommt zurück
Ich war naiv, doch mein Herz ist immer noch im Reinen
Ihr habt mir zwar nichts gegönnt, doch ich wünsche euch allen Glück
Ich brauche niemanden von euch, ich mach das ganz alleine
Heute macht ihr Faxen, aber glaubt mir, alles kommt zurück

Yeah ich hör' wie manche sagen, Alpa wäre tot
Wenn ich so wie damals wär, ging ich gewaltsam auf sie los,
Caney, alles kommt zurück, nein, ich wollte nie dein' Tuareg
Junge, guck dich heute um und sag, wer ist dein Bruder jetzt?
Die Leute könn' es nicht verstehen, die Dinge so wie ich zu sehen
Ihr haltet euch für Stars, aber habt bis heute nix bewegt
Ich kann sehen, wie deutsche Rapper Frust auf diesen Typen schieben
Weil ich zu viel Einblick in alle eure Lügen biete
Alpa Gun der Escobar, Ghettostar, rapp' brutal
Und all die Verräter da draußen, sie müssen jetzt bezahlen
Ich hab eine Rechnung da, die vor mir unterschrieben ist
Und heute geh ich erst, wenn ich von jedem meine Miete krieg'
Ging es nach euch, wär' bei mir gar nix los, mann ihr seid so schadenfroh
Aber dafür ist oben die Strafe hoch
Guck, alles kommt zurück, die guten und die schlechten Taten
Am jüngsten Tag muss hier jeder seine Rechnung zahlen

Ihr wart nie fair zu mir, ihr wolltet, dass ich nichts erreiche
Ihr habt eine Konkurrenz in mir gesehen und hattet Schiss
Ich brauche niemanden von euch, ich mach das jetzt alleine
Heute könnt ihr lachen, aber glaub mir, alles kommt zurück

Yeah yeah ich habe alle eure ganzen Spielchen mitgemacht
Aber nur dank eurem Neid hat bis heute nichts geklappt
Caney, jetzt ist Schicht im Schacht, alles kommt zurück

Ich bin jetzt erwachsen und hab keine Zeit für Rumgespiele
Ich musste viel zu oft bemerken, dass ihr mich nur bremst
Caney, Vertrauen ist ein Wort, an dem du dich verbrennst
Manchmal wird es richtig eng und du musst bemerken
Wie die meisten Menschen dich nicht kenn', Bruder, ja, so ist der Mensch
Ich kenn' das alles, also laber mich nicht zu
Ich war geradezu verflucht, denn mein Karma war nie gut, Caney
Alles kommt zurück und genauso tu' ich's heute auch

Alpa Gun,"Yeah, komm Cani setz dich hin und lass uns über Angst reden
Keiner von uns beiden muss vor den anderen angeben

Auch wenn wir am Lachen sind, im inneren sind wir steintot
Ich habe Angst davor dass die Vergangenheit einholt

So viel Ängste doch wir sprechen sie nie aus
Nun durch angst Bruder, weil wir keinen Schwächen anvertrauen
Keine Angst vor dem eigenen Tod, 
Ich habe nur Angst vor dem Tod meines Vaters
Angst Bruder vor der Position als Versager

Cani vor dem Sheytan und davor, dass ich am Mikrofon nix bezahlt mach
Ich habe kein Angst vor meinen Feinden, 
Ich habe nur Angst vor Freundschaft 
Denn heutzutage wechseln sie die Seiten!

Ich habe Angst vor Gott, weil der Teufel und vertickt
Ich hab Angst Bruder Angst meine Freundin zu verlieren, 
Denn mein Herz wäre ohne dich erfrohren wie in der Eiszeit
Bruder ich hab Angst vor dem Allein sein
Ja, ich habe Angst!

Ich glaub an dich wenn es soweit ist, 
Weiß ich dass ich dafür noch nicht bereit bin
Denn ich trau mich nicht irgendwann vor zustehen 
Und meine Sünden zu beichten
Ich werd' nervös und kriege Angst 
Jedes mal wenn ich daran denke (Angst) 
Ich frage mich ob ich noch alt werde oder steh ich kurz vor dem Ende

Jeah, komm Cani setz dich hin und lass uns über Angst reden
Bilder der Vergangenheit die hier an meiner Wand kleben
Ich habe keine Angst davor zu leben wie ein Schlucker, aber Bruder ich habe angst vor den Tränen meiner Mutter !

Denn in meinem Kindheit war ich kein vernünftiges Kind, 
Sündigte Blind ohne Angst vor dem jüngsten Gericht
Ich habe Angst vor den schlechten Taten die mich schießen durch mein Kopf
Und heute weiß ich das leben ist ein kurzer Stop
Alles dreht sich darum dass das Leben mal ein Ende nimmt 
Und ich habe Angst davor dass viele von uns im Cehennem sind
Ich hab keinen Angst wenn es um mich selber geht aber ich kriege Angst wenn ich nur einmal in die Augen meiner Eltern seh !

Ich habe Angst vor dem Tod meiner Brüder 
Und davor dass es nie wieder so wird wie früher
Das Leben ist ein Test indem du besser eine eins schreibst
Bruder ich habe Angst vor dem allein sein
Ja, ich habe Angst!

Ich glaub an dich wenn es so weit ist, 
Weiß ich dass ich dafür noch nicht bereit bin
Denn ich trau mich nicht irgendwann vor zustehen und meine Sünden zu beichten
Ich werde nervös und kriege Angst jedes Mal wenn ich daran denke 
(Angst) ich frage mich ob ich Alt werde oder steh ich kurz vor dem Ende?

Yeah, komm Cani setz dich hin und lass uns über Angst reden 
Keiner von uns beiden muss sich mit den anderen anlegen
Manchmal sagt man Dinge die man später bereut 
Und manchmal kann es dazu kommen dass es zu spät ist mein Freund
Ich habe es mir versprochen ich will kein Scheiß' mehr bauen
Ich bin Erwachsen will ein Kind und denke an meine Frau, 
Doch habe Angst dass mein Schicksal mir das alles versaut. 
Lieber Gott wen kann ich außer der Familie nur vertrauen?

Wir Menschen beten immer dann wenn wir nicht wissen wie es weiter geht
Ich glaub an dich und weiß dass es nach diesem Leben weiter geht
Irgendwann kommt auch meine Zeit und dann muss ich bereit sein
Ich habe Angst vor dem allein sei
Ja, ich habe Angst!

Ich glaub an dich wenn es soweit ist 
Weiß ich dass dafür noch nicht bereit bin
Denn ich trau mich nicht irgendwann vor zustehen 
Und meine Sünden zu beichten

Ja, ich glaub an dich yeah eh

Alpa Gun,"Seh' die Menschen im Leben,
Wie sie dir ins Gesicht lügen.
Ich seh' Menschen, die gefälscht sind,
Ich merk's an ihren Gesichtszügen!
Jeder sagt mir irgendwas,
Ich weiß nicht, wem ich glauben soll.
Schwören und leere Versprechen,
Ich hab' langsam die Schnauze voll!
Bitte sag' mir, was du siehst,
Bitte sag' nicht ""Irgendwas"".
Bitte sag' mir nicht,
Was du hast und was ich nicht hab'.
Deine Attitüde macht mich wütend,
Du wirst büßen,
Du beziehst Prügel!
Auch, wenn ich dir ein Knochen geb',
Benimm dich wie ein Rüde.
Du wirst schon fühlen,
Wie es ist zu lügen,
Wie es ist zu betrügen,
Wie es ist, den Tod mit Schmerz zu spüren!
Es macht dich müde,
Doch es gibt wirklich nur einen, der da ist.
Der Rest ist alles Lüge.
Komm' schon Homie,
Shizoe sag' es!

Weißt du nich',
Dass jedes Wort, das deinen Mund verlässt
Dich töten kann?
Warum lügst du nur?
Sag' warum du lügen musst.
Deine Zunge steckt wie ein Dolch in deiner Brust!
Sag' mal weißt du nich',
Dass jedes Wort, das deinen Mund verlässt,
Dich befreien kann?
Und jetzt guck' dich an.
Du betrügst dich doch nur selbst,
Denn das einzige, was zählt,
Ist was der Himmel von dir hält!
Du

Warum lügst du Homie?
Bitte sag' mir nicht, du hast deine Gründe!
Mit lügen kommst du nicht weiter,
Du weißt, das ist 'ne Sünde!
Ich war ehrlich auf'm Boden,
Hab' mich nach oben gezogen,
Und wenn's nicht anders ging,
Dann hab' ich nur aus Not gelogen.
Guck' wie verlogen die Welt ist,
Wie verlogen du selbst bist.
Auch wenn du viel Cash hast
Und in deinem fetten Benz sitzt!
Und die da oben, wie Dieter Bohlen.
Wird der Herr sich wiederholen?
Hat denn niemand von euch
In sich ein kleines bisschen Religion?
Guck' der Wahrheit ins Auge,
Und sag' nicht einfach ""egal""!
Ich sag' es immer und immer wieder
Und noch einmal!
Es gibt nur eins, was ich nicht sehe,
Doch weiß, dass er da ist.
Der Rest ist alles Lüge,
Komm schon Homie,
Shizoe sag' es!

Weißt du nich',

Dich befreien kann?
Und jetzt guck' dich an.
Du betrügst dich doch nur selbst,
Denn das einzige, was zählt,
Ist was der Himmel von dir hält!
Du

Ich weiß, Geld lacht dir ins Gesicht,
Die Scheine machen dich blind!
Plötzlich zappelt dein Herz
Und du freust dich, wie ein kleines Kind.
Jetzt, ist für dich alles vergessen,
Du willst an jeden Ort.
Denk' an dein Versprechen Homie,
Komm' und steh' zu deinem Wort!
Meine Augen sind Zeuge,
Du versuchst noch zu leugnen,
Sei' einmal ehrlich zu dir selbst
Und versuch' dich der Wahrheit zu beugen!
Schweig' Homie!
Wie kann man nur so ein Lügner sein?
Ein Lügner ist ein Lügner
Und wird für immer ein Lügner bleiben!
Du wirst schon merken,
Wie es ist zu lügen,
Wie es ist zu betrügen,
Wie es ist den Tod mit Schmerz zu begrüßen!
Geb' dir Mühe, bete,
Denn es gibt nur einen, der wahr ist!
Der Rest ist alles Lüge!
Komm' schon Homie!
Shizoe sag' es!

Weißt du nich',
Dass jedes Wort, das deinen Mund verlässt
Dich töten kann?

Alpa Gun,"Willkommen hier im Sumpf, es zieht mich immer tiefer rein
Die Tränen meiner Ma' werde ich mir nie verzeihen. 
Ich bin schwach und hab' euch gekränkt, du 
Gabst mir Leben, Gott ein Talent. 
Der Suff lügt dir vor das du die Last erträgst, 
Liebe ist stark doch der Hass, er lebt. 
Zwischen Ausverkauften Gig's und der Suchtklink konnte ich oft nicht weiter, 
Doch ich muss, schließlich habe ich einen Traum zu erfüllen in einem Raum voller Müll 
Wiegt die Luft zum Atmen schwer und die Kluft riesig. 
Der Ausgang ist so weit weg das kann nicht das „süße“ Leben sein so bitter wie der Alk schmeckt.
Ich sehe die Leute auf Party's, Koksen, Kiffen alles was Spaß bringt. 
Für die meisten ist da nix dabei doch die Drogen ließen mich allein' deswegen sag ich

Ey, Mein Kopf ist gefickt ich bin schlecht gelaunt 
Gib mir den Jimmy in die Hand ich ex ihn aus
Cani, nein leg mal Bitte diesen Dreck beiseite 
Du musst klar bleiben und das auch in schlechten Zeiten.
Vielleicht schenkt mir Gott am nächsten Morgen ein Lächeln 
Aber mit Alk kann ich weiter meine Sorgen vergessen
Cani, ich weiß du bist traurig und innerlich im Arsch, 
Aber wenn ich etwas tun kann, dann bin ich für dich da!

Ich guck' dich an und kann den Schmerz in dir sehen 
Auf der Suche nach einem Bruder der dich versteht. 
Du bist allein', du bist im Herzen gelähmt 
Aber Cani bleib stark solange die Erde sich dreht. 
Mach den Kopf zu, lass dir von keinem was erzählen 
Denn am Ende des Tages bist du allein' auf diesem Weg. 
Es bringt nix seine Probleme beim trinken zu vergessen, 
Denn ein Mann hat es nicht nötig sich dahinter zu verstecken. 
Ich hab' auch schon so vieles nur in Alkohol etränkt 
Bis ich irgendwann mal merkte, dass das alles einen Bremst, Cani. 
Du musst stark bleiben, hart und fokussiert sein, 
Du erreichst dein Ziel, wenn du immer konzentriert bleibst. 
Cani steh' auf es wird Zeit es in die Hand zu nehmen 
Du musst nur auf dich gucken egal wo die anderen stehen. 
Kipp die Flasche weg mein Freund du bist viel zu gut dafür 
Und in harten Zeiten hast du einen Bruder hier.

Ey, Mein Kopf ist gefickt ich bin schlecht gelaunt 
Gib mir den Jimmy in die Hand und ich ex ihn aus
Cani, Nein leg mal Bitte diesen Dreck beiseite 
Du musst klar bleiben und das auch in schlechten Zeiten.
Vielleicht schenkt mir Gott am nächsten Morgen ein Lächeln 
Aber mit Alk kann ich weiter meine Sorgen vergessen
Cani, ich weiß du bist traurig und innerlich im Arsch, 
Aber wenn ich etwas tun kann, dann bin ich für dich da!

Wenn ich meinen Frieden finde suchen sie Streit. 
Ich will nicht viel außer clean sein 
Und ich sträub' mich gegen meine Abhängigkeit 
Mit der Rüstung am Leib auch wenn der Kampf endlos scheint. 
Meine Augen sind nach vorn gerichtet bis mein Herz all den Zorn vernichtet 
Werd' ich mit der Mukke aufdrehen lass die Dinge ihren lauf nehmen bis ich drauf geh'

Ich weiß das Leben macht ein' Bauchweh, 
Aber Cani du musst aufstehen, rausgehen und es damit aufnehmen. 
Du bist stabil Cani tief in dir drin' 
Du willst klar sehen für immer aber Liebe macht blind. 
Dein Vertrauen ist wie Gold wert 
Und dein Stolz ist durch nichts zu zerbrechen ob du Benz oder Golf fährst. 
Es wird Zeit sich vom Krieg zu entfernen denn nur so Bruder kommst du deinem Ziel immer näher.

Ich bin alles, was man heutzutage braucht zum Bewegen
Guck, ohne mich hättest du nicht mal ein Zuhause zum Leben
Ich bin der Hass in deiner Welt und die Liebe erfriert
Nur wegen mir sind schon unendliche Kriege passiert
Die Menschen glaubten mal an Gott, doch heute dienen sie mir
Der Teufel hat mich erschaffen, damit der Frieden hier stirbt
Ich hab schon so viele Menschen auseinander gebracht
So viele Menschen saßen wegen mir so lange im Knast
Mann, aber glaub mir, ich hab auch gute Seiten und Ecken
Hast du genug von mir, dann kannst du jede Scheiße vergessen

Keiner, der hier wegen mir gezwung' wäre, krank zu bleiben
Nur seid ihr blind, denn ihr wollt mich unbedingt
Euer Leben dreht sich nur um diese Macht und den Gewinn

Weil ich mittlerweile sogar ganze Staaten kontrollier'
Keiner könnte mich mal eben so kopieren
Mittlerweile waren so viele bereit für mich, ihr Leben zu verlieren
Wegen mir werden Menschen im Mercedes rumchauffiert
Und die andern sind dazu gezwung' im Regen zu erfrieren

Ohne mich in deiner Tasche gibt da draußen auf dich jeder ein' Fick
Mann, sie stehen auf wegen mir, gehen da raus wegen mir
So viele Männer verlieren ihre Frauen wegen mir
Viele haben dieses Ziel, mich zu gewinn', drehen durch
Gehen in Spielehöhlen rein und verlieren sich da drin
Viele wollen mich als besten Freund
Geh da raus und mit mir in deiner Tasche gibt es immer nur das beste Zeug
So viele Menschen hier verändern sich für mich
Und wenn ich ehrlich bin, ist noch lange kein Ende hier in Sicht
Sie zerstören diese Welt und penetrieren nur wegen mir

Alpa Gun,"Yeah
Halim, ich hab die letzte Nacht von dir geträumt
Ich hab dich zwischen den Sternen gesehen, mein alter Freund
Du warst mein bester Freund, schon als wir kleine Kinder waren
Es sind jetzt zwanzig Jahre her, wir zwei haben viel versäumt
Wir waren zusammen im Kindergarten, in der Vorschule
Trugen dieselben Jacken und dieselben Sportschuhe
Ich war der Ruhige, die anderen haben sich dumm benommen
Ich wurde oft gehänselt, du hast mich immer in Schutz genommen
Du hast die Schuld auf dich genommen, wenn ich mal Scheiße gebaut hab
Ich weiß noch wie du dich in der Schule für mich gehauen hast
Wir waren in getrennten Klassen, sahen uns nur im Pausenhof
Saßen einfach nur da und aßen unser Pausenbrot
Wir waren wie Brüder, haben alles brüderlich geteilt doch
Ich war noch jung und hab das leider Früher nicht gepeilt
Es tut mir Leid, Bruder, auch wenn ich dich nicht seh‘
Grade jetzt wo du nicht mehr da bist tut es richtig weh.

So ist das wenn man jemand verliert, dann hat man Schmerzen
Du warst mehr als ein Bruder für mich, ich trag' dich in meinem Herzen
Mich quält die Trauer, ich kann den Tränen nicht widerstehen
Ich hoffe nur dass wir uns irgendwann mal wieder sehen
Ich geb‘ die Hoffnung nicht auf und warte auf mein Ende
Schick mir ein Engel oder bitte reich‘ mir deine Hände
Auch wenn ich wollte, könnte ich den Tränen nicht widerstehen
Ich hoffe nur dass wir uns irgendwann mal wieder sehen

Alles war in Ordnung, wir hatten keine Sorgen
Wir haben für den Moment gelebt und dachten nicht an morgen
Wir waren zwar arm, dafür haben wir jeden Tag gelacht
Auch ohne Geld haben wir draußen sehr viel Spaß gehabt
Die meisten Kinder auf der Schule hatten reiche Eltern
Der Vater von Stefan kam jedes Mal mit einem Geschenk an
Die neusten Schuhe oder die neusten Computer-Spiele
Doch wir waren zufrieden mit einem Fußball und 'ner Wundertüte
Und wenn wir Hunger hatten, waren wir bei meiner Tante
Ich mein bei deiner Mutter gab es jeden Freitag Mante.
Und manchmal waren wir bei mir Zuhause Börek essen
Du wolltest immer die mit Fleisch, ich werd‘ es nie vergessen
Plötzlich war ich alleine. Ohne dich an meiner Seite
Auß’m Nichts kam diese Nachricht, man fand deine Leiche
Ich erinnere mich an diesen Tag, als wär' es gestern
Ich weiß du kommst bestimmt ins Paradies, ich glaube fest dran
Wie wär‘ die Welt mit dir? Was wär‘ aus dir geworden?
Sei dir gewiss, mit dir ist auch ein Teil von mir gestorben
Es tut mir Leid, doch ich kann den Tränen nicht widerstehen
Ich hoffe nur dass ich dich irgendwann mal wieder seh‘

So ist das wenn man jemand verliert, dann hat man Schmerzen
Du warst mehr als ein Bruder für mich, ich trag' dich in meinem Herzen
Mich quält die Trauer, ich kann den Tränen nicht widerstehen
Ich hoffe nur dass wir uns irgendwann mal wieder sehen
Ich geb‘ die Hoffnung nicht auf und warte auf mein Ende
Schick mir ein Engel oder bitte reich‘ mir deine Hände
Auch wenn ich wollte, könnte ich den Tränen nicht widerstehen
Ich hoffe nur dass wir uns irgendwann mal wieder sehen",Halim

Major Movez, nein, ich muss bei keinem Major sein
Ja, ich hab 'ne Glatze und ich steh' drauf
Wenn du mir was sagen willst dazu, dann triffst du mich hier im Teehaus

Du musst in 'nem Zelt pennen, du bist ein echter Typ

Ich habe Schulden und warte, bis ich endlich mein' Vorschuss krieg

Hunger habe und wie die meisten auf ein Wunder warte
Stimmt, ich mach Musik, doch komm nicht klar mit euern Unterlagen
Schreib noch ein Album, während sie die alten runterladen

Geld macht nicht glücklich, aber ohne bist du auch nicht munter
Tief in deinem Innern hast du diesen einen Traum gebunkert
Denn das Leben ist 'ne Achterbahn und es geht rauf und runter
Sie lassen dich ackern, dann klopfen sie dir nur auf die Schulter
Ich fang' wieder bei null an, es kommt auf die Geduld an
Vielleicht hab ich auch mal so ein Glück und lebe wie ein Sultan
Vielleicht hab ich auch mal in der Einfahrt ein' Ferrari stehen
Ich will in die besten Restaurants, wenn sich mein Magen dreht
Ich komm' aus 'ner Gegend, wo die meisten von uns Hunger haben
Ich will nicht beim Arbeitsamt auf irgendeine Nummer warten
Dir geht es gut, ich will auch was von deinem Hummer haben
Mit einem Koffer voller Geld zu meiner Mutter fahren
Mittlerweile ist schön öfter wegen euch mein Traum geplatzt
All die leeren Versprechungen machen mich auch nicht satt
Aufgepasst, jetzt nehm' ich das Mic in meine Hand
Ziehe durch das ganze Land und zeig den Leuten was ich kann
Ich habe Hunger

Ja, ich habe Hunger und ich habe Durst
Nicht jeder weiß, was das für ein Gefühl ist
Mann, ich habe Hunger, es ist nicht einfach, wenn einem der Magen knurrt
Doch ich weiß, was das für ein Gefühl ist
Ja, ich habe Hunger, Hunger, Hunger, 
Ich habe Hunger, Hunger, Hunger
Ich habe Hunger, Hunger, Hunger, 
Ich habe Hunger, (Hustle hard, never give up)

Ich war immer loyal zu jedem Freund
Doch heut' denk' ich an mich und sorg' dafür, dass die Karriere läuft
Eröffne dann mein' ersten Laden hier in meiner alten Gegend
Und verkauf dir dann vielleicht im Angebot ein halbes Hähnchen
Ehrlich gesagt bin ich seit Jahren genervt
Doch dazu sag ich nix mehr, ich hab das Warten gelernt
Denn an so manchen Tagen, Caney, war die Straße nicht fair
Ich würd' so gerne mit dir feiern, doch mein Magen ist leer
Ich habe Hunger

Ja, ich habe Hunger und ich habe Durst
Nicht jeder weiß, was das für ein Gefühl ist
Mann, ich habe Hunger, es ist nicht einfach, wenn einem der Magen knurrt
Doch ich weiß, was das für ein Gefühl ist
Ja, ich habe Hunger, Hunger, Hunger, 
Ich habe Hunger, Hunger, Hunger
Ich habe Hunger, Hunger, Hunger,

Alpa Gun,"Jo, Isa. Wie geht's, mein Freund? Alles klar?

Alpa Gun, alles gut?

Ja, Mann

Was macht die Musik, Mann?

Die Musik läuft! (Ja?) War fleißig im Studio, 
hab gute Songs aufgenomm'. 
Mein viertes Album ist g'rad draußen, 
„Alles kommt zurück“. 
Wie geht's dir? Was machst du so?

Ja, Mann, weißt ja, ja, weißt ja, wie die Straße ist, 
Mann. Ey, im Moment ist alles g'rad so 'n bisschen heiß, ja? 
Ich schnüffel' 'n bisschen rum, versuch noch so über die Runden zu komm' 
und so. Kennst mich ja, Mann, kennst mich",Intro
Alpa Gun,"Yeah geboren am 4. Juli 1980
Ihr wolltet mich schon immer runterhalten, aber macht nix
Ein Türke aus Berlin, ich bin aufgewachsen in Schöneberg
Gras ticken war das einzige, was hier 'ne Lösung wär'
Alper Abi, ich war hier für jeden der Dealer
Und hab die Aggro Berliner dann über Jahre beliefert
Wollte das Reime kicken auch ein kleines bisschen probieren
In Cottbus hab ich für Bushido dann die Stiche kassiert
Und heute fragen sie Alpa, wie dieses Rap-Geschäft so läuft
Die meisten, die ich kenne, sind besessen vom Erfolg
Es war 2004, ich war Azad und so viele am Beleidigen
Aber nur um Sido zu verteidigen
Jeder kennt den Typen, der von da an bei der Sekte war
8 Jahre später und ich bin im deutschen Rap ein Star
2007 Waren die Straßen nicht mehr sicher
Denn der erste Ausländer hat geladen und entsichert

Ich hate nicht, ich bin zu real für die Medien
Und trotzdem spiel' ich in Serien und alle da, da, da, da, da
Wozu denn auch, ich bin beliebt bei den Mädchen
Aus den verschiedensten Städten und alle da, da, da, da, da
Die ganzen Jungs feiern mich mies in der Gegend
Lan, ich genieße mein Leben und alle da, da, da, da, da
Wer außer mir spielt dieses Spiel hier mit Ehre?
Ich hab so viel zu erzählen und alle da, da, da, da, da

Ich hab mit „Ausländer“ alle deutschen Straßen infiziert
Und die ganzen Major-Labels waren interessiert
Ich ging zu Universal, der Siggi hat mich da hingebracht
Aber zu dieser Zeit hat jeder irgendwie sein Ding gemacht
Ich war Sidos Back-Up-Rapper, aber auch nicht mehr
Und mit der Zeit wurd' mir klar, hier läuft doch irgendwas verkehrt
Caney, damals hörten alle deine Scheiß-Idole mich
Ich war der Erste hier auf HDF mit 3 Millionen Klicks
Hatte Beef mit Kay One und Bushido für Rap-Fans
3 Jahre später, er und Sido sind Best Friends
Nach der Disserei hab ich Almanci gebracht
Und wenn ich heute ehrlich bin, dann war das Ganze verkackt
Mann, Universal hat keine Kraft in Alpa gesteckt
Zu dieser Zeit ging ich jede Nacht alleine ins Bett
Die ersten Rapper kam'n, die über Alpa Märchen erzähl'n
Aber der Tag wird noch kommen und wir werden uns seh'n

Ich hate nicht, ich bin zu real für die Medien
Und trotzdem spiel' ich in Serien und alle da, da, da, da, da
Wozu denn auch, ich bin beliebt bei den Mädchen
Aus den verschiedensten Städten und alle da, da, da, da, da
Die ganzen Jungs feiern mich mies in der Gegend
Lan, ich genieße mein Leben und alle da, da, da, da, da
Wer außer mir spielt dieses Spiel hier mit Ehre?
Ich hab so viel zu erzählen und alle da, da, da, da, da

Als ich nichts am bring' war, sind allen Eiern gewachsen
Doch wie ihr heute merkt, macht hier seit neustem keiner mehr Faxen
Hab mir geschworen, dass ich Kollegah auf'm Splash ein Stich verpass'
Aber weil er so ein Netter war, hab ich nix gemacht
2012 Hab ich selber in die Hand genommen
Und bin mit meiner 3. Platte dann hier angekommen
Hab das Wort „Ehre“ hier im Rap definiert
Die Kanacken in Berlin hören Rap wegen mir
Habe Sido meine Freundschaft gekündigt, es wurd' doch eh Zeit
Keiner von euch wusste jemals, was Loyalität heißt
Ehrensache, Platz 12, Media Control
Du siehst Alpa auf der Leinwand im Kino wie Stallone
Yeah, ich war immer grade und bin nie nach dem Erfolg gegangen
Und trotzdem ist mein „Halt die Fresse“ Gold, Gold gegangen
Ich geh auf die Stage und die Halle spielt verrückt
Es ist 2013 und alles kommt zurück, yeah

Ich hate nicht, ich bin zu real für die Medien
Und trotzdem spiel' ich in Serien und alle da, da, da, da, da
Wozu denn auch, ich bin beliebt bei den Mädchen
Aus den verschiedensten Städten und alle da, da, da, da, da
Die ganzen Jungs feiern mich mies in der Gegend
Lan, ich genieße mein Leben und alle da, da, da, da, da
Wer außer mir spielt dieses Spiel hier mit Ehre?
Ich hab so viel zu erzählen und alle da, da, da, da, da",Das Ist Alpa
Alpa Gun,"Erzähl mal! Was war gestern mit Julia?

Ach Mann. Vergiss mal Julia, 
Ich hab die gefickt, Mann, das war's. 
Jetzt hab ich ne neue, Jenny. 
Die ist so verknallt in mich, Alter. 
Und die ist reich, Mann! Die ist reich! 
Ey, weißt du, was ich alles bei der Zuhause mitnehm' kann? 
Die Frau ist Jackpot, Alter! Jackpot!

Alpa Gun,"Yeah, ich hätte alles getan, nur um dich glücklich zu sehen,
Doch dir war es egal auf mich Rücksicht zu nehmen,
Waren beide so verliebt wie noch nie zuvor
Ich wollte kämpfen, aber habe diesen Krieg verloren
Was für hatten nahm' ich ernst Canim du warst meine Landsfrau
Nur immer wieder holte uns deine Angst auf
Also kam ich mit um deine Eltern zu sprechen,
Aber die Bitte deines Vaters war nicht schnell zu vergessen
Ich konnte es nicht akzeptieren weil die Liebe zu stark war
Würde alles dafür tun damit es wieder wird wie damals
Leider gab es kein Happy End in diesem Drama
Alles kommt zurück auf dieser Welt Engel Karma
Ich kann spüren wie die Trauer mich zu Boden reißt,
Jedes Mal aufs Neue wenn ich über deine Fotos streich'
Hätte nie gedacht, das diese Liebe so quält,
Es ist schwer zu akzeptieren, das wir uns nie wieder sehen

Und heute stehe ich hier mit deinem Foto in der Hand
Wie schnell sind die letzten Jahre ohne dich vergangen
Würde Alles tun nur um dich noch ein Mal zu sehen,
Aber heute ist es leider zu spät
Man du sollst nur wissen, das ich dich nie vergessen hab,
Ich wünsche dir vom ganzen Herzen das du es heute besser hast,
Schatz es ist zu spät,
Auch wenn du es heute bereust, es ist zu spät, (Yeah) es ist zu spät

Yeah Man die Lage war so schwer, nur wir wollten es nicht sehen
Doch das Schicksal ist geschrieben also sollte es geschehen
Immer wieder trafen wir uns heimlich
In irgendwelchen Parks
Nach jedem treffen Canim war die ganze Welt so schwarz
Du hast so viel Farbe in mein Leben gebracht
Und die Musik war dir egal, du hast die Karrieren gehasst,
Dir war egal dass ich ein Rapper bin,
Dir ging's um meine Art
An diesem ganzen Drumherum hattest du kein Bedarf,
Immer wenn du bei mir warst,
War mir alles andere so scheißegal
Ich wollte dich nur halten in meinem Arm
Jeden zweiten Tag warst du bei mir und wir fühlten uns dann so frei,
Ich hab dich geehrt so wie eine Hochheit,
Doch dein Vater wusste das wir uns noch immer sehen
Er war überzeugt davon das ich krumme Dinger dreh
Alles war umsonst denn heute bin ich dein Ex
Von einem Tag auf den anderen Tag warst du soweit weg

Und heute stehe ich hier mit deinem Foto in der Hand
Wie schnell sind die letzten Jahre ohne dich vergangen
Würde Alles tun nur um dich noch ein Mal zu sehen,
Aber heute ist es leider zu spät
Man du sollst nur wissen, das ich dich nie vergessen hab,
Ich wünsche dir vom ganzen Herzen das du es heute besser hast,
Schatz es ist zu spät,
Auch wenn du es heute bereust, es ist zu spät, (Yeah) es ist zu spät

Ich werde diesen Morgen nie vergessen, Schatz
Deine Nachricht weckte mich
Mit den Worten ich bin weg und und ich vergesse dich
Meine Eltern wünschen sich für mein Leben was besseres
Und deine SMS traf mich wie ein Messerstich
Jetzt sind wir am Wendepunkt, du hast nie gekämpft für uns,
Es hat dir nicht mal weh getan diese Veränderung,
Du bist Fort in die Türkei ohne mir leb' wohl zu sagen,
Wie es so kommt wirst du auch bald eine Verlobung haben,
Weißt du noch was wir uns mal geschworen haben,
Du wolltest immer mit mir sein, weil die anderen für dich Idioten waren
Heute gibt es nichts was mich treibt außer meine Wut,
Warum hast du nicht gekämpft wenigstens nur ein Versuch
Ich kann erst heute drüber schreiben nach so vielen Jahren
Auch wenn ich drüber weg bin, warst du mir noch nie egal
Hätt' alles getan, um dich ein Mal zu sehen
Aber Canim dafür ist es mittlerweile zu spät

Und heute stehe ich hier mit deinem Foto in der Hand
Wie schnell sind die letzten Jahre ohne dich vergangen
Würde Alles tun nur um dich noch ein Mal zu sehen,
Aber heute ist es leider zu spät
Man du sollst nur wissen, das ich dich nie vergessen hab,
Ich wünsche dir vom ganzen Herzen das du es heute besser hast,

Auch wenn du es heute bereust, es ist zu spät

Alpa Gun,"Yeah ich lebe rein in den Tag, ohne Zeit für mein' Schlaf
Wegen Stress immer high von dem Gras
Ich will nur Ruhe für ein' einzigen Tag
Obwohl ich jung bin, ist mein Geist so im Arsch
Geh' da raus und erkenn' die ganzen Fressen, die reden
Ist egal, Bruder, scheiß drauf, ich lächel' für jeden
Gib ein' Fick auf die Menschen, die mein Leben beneiden
Zieh' dir einmal meine Schuhe an und geh eine Meile
Du wirst sehen, dass nicht alles glänzt, was Gold ist
Auf diesem Weg bringt dir auch dein Gangster-Stolz, nichts
Blick doch mal hinter die Kulissen
ÜBer die Jahre hat mich so vieles innerlich zerrissen
Ich will atmen, endlich wieder Luft kriegen
Weg von den Menschen, die jeden Tag nur Frust schieben
Lauf nur einmal in mein' Schuhen, yeah
Und du wirst dir wünschen, Caney, dass du wieder du wärst

Ich bin so müde
Komm, lauf nur einmal in mein' Schuhen durch diese Wüste
Und wenn du schlapp machst, wirst du wissen, wie ich fühle
Alles Lüge, aber glaub mir, ich spüre nichts
Ich bin nur müde, so müde, so müde, dass es mich zerbricht

Dieser Traum von uns selbst führt uns raus in die Welt
Alles was wir wollen ist ein Haus und viel Geld
Das gute in dei'm Herz wird missbraucht und zwar schnell
Also achte auf dein' Weg und vertraue nur dir selbst, Caney
Dieses Leben hat mich müde gemacht
Denn bis nach oben haben's immer nur Betrüger geschafft
Und diese Welt, Bruder, hält uns in 'ner Lüge gefang'
Auch wenn ich gerne kämpfen würde, ich bin müde vom Kampf
Wir warten immer noch hier unten auf die richtige Zeit
Bist du ein niemand da draußen, Caney, dann bist du allein
Und warum denken die Leute, sie würden mich verstehen?
Von all den Ding', die ich sah, habt ihr nix gesehen
Meine Last, sie ist tonn'schwer, ich würde chillen, jeden Tag
Wenn ich wüsste, dass das leben so gewonn' wär'
Mich lassen jegliche Gefühle kalt
Ich will das Leben wieder lieben, aber spüre nur die Müdigkeit

Ich bin so müde
Komm, lauf nur einmal in mein' Schuhen durch diese Wüste
Und wenn du schlapp machst, wirst du wissen, wie ich fühle
Alles Lüge, aber glaub mir, ich spüre nichts

Ich bin so müde, so müde, dass ich nicht mehr kann
Doch gib mir Mühe, mehr Mühe
Aber glaub mir, ich spüre, nicht mal, dass ich am Leben bin
Ich bin so müde, so müde, so müde, dass es mich zerbricht

Ich bin so müde
Komm, lauf nur einmal in mein' Schuhen durch diese Wüste
Und wenn du schlapp machst, wirst du wissen, wie ich fühle

Ich lad' euch alle gerne zu mir nach Berlin ein
Deutsche Rapper dissen nur, um sich zu vertragen
Eure ehrenlosen Moves sind für mich nicht zu ertragen
Ich sag die Wahrheit, für euch ist das wie ein Stich in den Magen
Bitte mach mir kein' auf Männer, ihr seid richtige Plagen
Der eine wurde oft beleidigt als ein Hund von Bushido
Doch ein paar Jahre später war er dann der Hund von Bushido
Macht ein' auf Kumpel im Video, ich muss kotzen, wenn ich das alles seh'

Doch irgendwie gibt's kein' in der Szene, der mir widerspricht
Das ist nur die Wahrheit, Caney, speicher' sie dir in dein' Kopf
Alpa ist real, ich bin keiner, der von hinten kommt
Lasst mal eure Politik, könnt ihr nicht ihr selbst bleiben?
90% der Rapper lassen sich vom Geld leiten
Pumpen Anabol in ihre Adern, bis sie platzen
Ich laber' keinen Schwachsinn, der Vater aller Glatzen
Newcomer dissen mich so fuchsteufelswild
Aber wenn sie vor mir stehen, sind sie mucksmäuschenstill
Typisch Rapperpolitik, kleiner Junge
Bitte rede nur vom Messer, wenn du's ziehst, um zu stechen in mein Knie

Und bei Beef will ich mit keinem von euch irgendwas klären
Alpa Gun hat Ehre, glaub mir, und ich steh zu mei'm Wort
Battlerap ist so wie Boxen und ich leb' für den Sport
Dieser Kay macht Propaganda bei Facebook, seitdem er sich versteckt
Erstmal groß werden über Jahre und dann ist er weg

Alpa Gun,"Ich erzähle dir 'ne Story Canim von einem Freund
Damit du verstehen kannst wie es heute leider läuft
Er war ein Türke und seine Freundin war Kurdin,
Beide patriotisch und stolz auf ihre Wurzeln
Sie war so hübsch und er ein richtiger Mann
Es war Gottes Wille, so führte sie das Schicksal zusammen
Er tat alles um sie glücklich zu sehen,
Es war kein Ding auf ihr Familienleben Rücksicht zu nehmen,
Er hatte Stolz und Ehre.
Sie wussten, dass es schwer wird aufgrund der politischen Probleme,
Doch nichts kam ihrer Liebe in die Quere.
Atilla und Dilan, ein wunderschönes Paar
Doch an jedem schönen Ort lauern dunkle Gefahren, Caney
Sie war noch jung und er war älter als sie
Aber beide waren doch so verliebt Caney, Kopftherapie
Ihr war es egal wenn Bruder etwas sagt,
In der Hoffnung, dass Allah eine Zukunft für sie plant Caney
Sie wollten beide unbedingt in die Türkei fahren
Und dann Islamisch bei einem Hoca heiraten
Die Zwei behielten ihr Geheimnis für sich
Doch an diesen einen Tag wurden beide erwischt

Hört ihr die Stimmen der Leidenden?
Hört ihr sie lauter, als jemals zuvor?
So beendet diesen zwischenmenschlichen Krieg
Besser als liebenden die Liebe zu entziehen!

Yeah, es war Dilans Bruder Mehmet der die beiden im Café sah
Du willst meine Schwester klären? Man das war ein Fehler!
Aus ihm kam der Schläger, so ging er auf Atilla los
Ohne dran zu denken wie sehr er Dilan weh tat
Ihre Eltern riefen am Abend seine Familie an
Es dauerte nicht lange bis ein Krieg begann
Atilla sein Vater nannte ihn ein Serefsiz und war am Ausrasten.
Wie kannst du nur eine Kurdin in unser Haus lassen?
Ihre Liebe wurde mit Politik vermischt
Doch für ihn war klar, dass er Dilan nie vergisst
Also sucht er sie um mit ihr abzuhauen irgendwo,
Aber Atilla fand sie nirgendwo.
Dilan war zerstört und am Boden Zuhaus'.
Und als sie später bei ihm anrief konnte er seinen Ohren nicht trauen.
„Ich hab dich nie geliebt. Für mich war das alles nur ein Spiel
Und das diese Trennung dich zerstört war von Anfang an mein Ziel“
Und so fiel ihm sein Handy aus der Hand
Und er holte sich die Gun aus dem Schrank seines Vaters voller Angst
„Ich tat alles was ich kann
Aber sie hat mich nicht einmal geliebt
Lieber Gott, bitte vergib mir wenn ich schieß.""

Hört ihr die Stimmen der Leidenden?
Hört ihr sie lauter, als jemals zuvor?
So beendet diesen zwischenmenschlichen Krieg
Besser als liebenden die Liebe zu entziehen!

Hey Leute, hier ist Atilla
Ich bin im Moment nicht zu erreichen
Aber ihr könnt mir gerne eine Nachricht nachdem Peeps hinterlassen
Bis dann

Hey Canim, ich musste vorhin so reden, mein Vater war neben mir
Er hat micht gezwungen, meld dich bitte
Mach mir schon Sorgen, du weißt doch ich liebe dich",Verbotene Liebe 2

Ich würd' ihr alles anvertrau'n, mein Geld, mein Herz, ey, 
Sie kann mein Leben haben. Alles würd' ihr anvertrau'n, ich schwör's dir!

Sag mal, hast du Fieber oder so?",Verliebt (Skit)
Alpa Gun,"Ich guck' mich um und kann das Leid auf der Welt sehen
Selfmade, weil sich alles nur um Geld dreht
Krieg wegen Religion, Krieg wegen Schätzen
Kriege um Macht die den Frieden ersetzten
Ganglife, Endside. Willst du den Erfolg? Darfst du kein Mensch sein
Jede zweite will nur in den Benz rein
Haram ist der Weg und nur wenige von uns
Sprechen Allah beim Gebet, Caney
Guck dich mal um, nur um Klarsicht zu kriegen
Die meisten meiner Freunde sind hier gar nicht zu Frieden
Jeder guckt auf sich an so Tagen wie diesen
Sie warten auf ein Grund um mit der Scharfen zu schießen
Bruder es herrscht Krieg auf der Welt
Und jede zweite wäre hier bereit sich für Profit zu verstellen
Caney, steh zu deinem Wort und es wird teuer für dich
Wir warten alle auf dem Tag an dem das Feuer erlischt

Guck wie die Welt brennt
Sie sind am zittern und sie schreien
Doch die meisten Menschen mischen sich nicht ein
Weil hier jeder nur ans Geld denkt
Bruder hier will jeder an die Macht
Nur die meisten Menschen geben ihre Seele dafür ab
Diese Welt brennt. Hörst du die Bomben wie sie fallen?
Und sie hören damit erst auf, wenn die Sonne nicht mehr scheint
Bruder schnell renn, wir habe leider keine Zeit
Diese Welt brennt. Guck wie die Welt brennt

Wie halten uns für Menschen, doch leben so wie Tiere
In dieser Welt mutiert ein Wesen zu Maschine
Elendige Kriege, mittlerweile überall
Der Kanake draußen plant sein ersten Überfall
Das kleine Mädchen verzieht sich und weint sicher
Denn ihre Mutter, sie verkauft sich für ein 30ziger
Jeder zweite bleibt Ticker und will hier der Baba sein
Bis das SEK einmarschiert, Caney yallah bye
So viele lasten die hier keiner mehr sieht
Wir sind wie Hunde, das System, ist die Leine am ziehen
Mein Bruder, ganz wenige pflegen die Liebe zur Familie
Der Glaube wird geteilt in Sunnite und Schiite
Kurde oder Türke, Jude oder Christ
Also musst du damit leben, wenn die Kugel dich erwischt
Caney, steh zu deinem Wort und es wird teuer für dich
Wir warten alle auf dem Tag an dem das Feuer erlischt

Guck wie die Welt brennt
Sie sind am zittern und sie schreien

Alpa Gun,"Zehn harte Rapper möchten Beef mit Alpa Gun
Sie rennen mir hinterher ich nehm' die Beine in die Hand
Der Eine war zu fett und konnte einfach nicht mehr rollen
So fiel er auf den Boden und dann waren’s nur noch neun
Der neunte war brutal, hielt mir sein Messer ins Gesicht
Ich wich ihm einfach aus und sah wie er den andern trifft, hey

Guck ich alleine, gegen sie alle
Sie tun alles dafür dass ich falle
Bist du erfolgreich, dann ärgern sie sich
Denn sie wären so gerne ein Rapper wie ich

Acht harte Rapper doch jetzt sind es nur noch sieben
Denn der Achte hat wohl grade bei 'nem Major unterschrieben
Der Siebte war zu schwach und dachte ständig nur an Sex
So lief er schnell in 'nen Puff, nahm sich ne Frau dann waren’s Sechs
Sechs harte Rapper, guck der eine war zu dünn
Ich gab ihm eine Boxe und dann waren’s nur noch fünf, hey

Guck ich alleine, gegen sie alle

Fünf harte Rapper, die mich stressen ohne Grund
Ich seh‘ Ali wie er sich den fünften Rapper nimmt als Hund
Vier harte Rapper wollten gern‘ wie Rambo sein
Doch einer kackte ab und fing auf einmal an zu schleimen
Drei harte Rapper guck sie fliehen vor Alpa Gun
Sie rennen um ihr Leben bis der eine nicht mehr kann, hey

Guck ich alleine, gegen sie alle

Filmstar, ab jetzt läuft meine Promo auf dem Ersten ?
Ich hab mich für kurze Zeit zurückgelehnt, darauf musst du Rücksicht nehmen
Aber jetzt geht es weiter also drück auf Play
Immer noch ein Ehrenmann, fang keine Probleme an
Ich hab ein gutes Herz doch kann auch töten Caney, Elefant
Immer noch der gleiche Kerl, nur jetzt bin ich Top Five
Grüße raus an Gündoğan, alles Gute zur Hochzeit
Fünftes Album, jetzt geht's los, ich hab das Geschäft verschont
Alper Abi ist für deutsche Rapper die Respektsperson
Ich will nichts über die Vergangenheit mit Sido wissen
Heute bin ich selber unterwegs und mache Kinobusiness
Nenn mich Alper Abi Siggi, du weisst, dass ich älter bin
Ich wollt dir nur sagen, dass deine neuen Lieder seltsam klingen

Kay ist nur ein V-Mann, er vertraut jetzt auf's Gesetz
Und die anderen, die es sonst so gibt, sie sind auch nicht echt
Ihr müsst jetzt die Klappen halten und dürft höchstens
Bei meinem nächsten Filmdreh einmal kurz die Klappen halten
Şerefsiz, lächel nicht, bevor du auf die Fresse kriegst
Paparazzis überall, hörst du, wie die Presse knipst?
Ihr macht jetzt auf sexy mit Champanger und Jetski
Ich lauf durch die Straßen mit Salvar und Tesbih
Komm mal her, Alper Abi, Jet Li, Neben mir
Sind alle die andren Rapper zweite Wahl, so wie Pepsi
Ich bin jetzt erwachsen, nein ich häng nicht mehr mit Fotzen rum
Mok du Hund, komm mir in die Quere und ich knock dich um

Alpa Gun ist zu beliebt, der, der ohne Skrupel schießt
Ich verprügel' diese Affen, so wie in der UFC
Zwölf letzte Takte, die die Fakten noch mal klar stellen
Major moves als Kartell, ich hol mir mein Bargeld
Metzger, so wie Stefan Raab, schlachte diese Mastschweine
Auch wenn ich abschweife, Trip kriegt 'ne Backpfeife

Heute wird mein Flug nach Istanbul von Major Movez bezahlt
Ich häng in der business Class und denk an Zeiten als es noch nicht so war
Ich war auf der Straße und vertickte Gras
Ja wir waren richtig Arm
Schöneberg in Palasthof da wurd' ich mit den Arabs groß 
So ging die Jagd nach Parra los
Rapper hab ich alle samt nur ausgelacht
So lang das Ott am laufen war
Ich machte mit Gras am tag ein 1000er
Straßenleben bis die ersten Brüder in den Rücken fallen
Kraft haben abwarten Haftstrafen Schüsse fallen
Das war nicht mein Ding 
Ich wollte es immer weit bringen
Heute ist meine Gage wie der preis einer Breitling
Ich Danke Gott dafür das die Zeiten jetzt vorbei sind
Ich war auf fünf und mach so lange weiter bis ich eins bin

Es war nicht immer so und heute weiß ich 
Dass das ist mein Leben ich hab mir alles selber beigebracht
Viele meiner Freunde sitzen heute noch in Einzelhaft
Doch Alpa Gun hat es aus dem Ghetto allein geschafft 

Es war nicht immer so und heute seh 
Ich's klar und ich bedanke mich beim lieben Gott dafür an jeden tag
Scheiß auf die Vergangenheit das ist die Gegenwart
Alpa Gun der Rapstar der aus deiner Gegend kam

Alpa Gun jetzt bin ich im business unterwegs 
Doch egal wie viel Termine ich verrichte mein Gebet Canim
Damals hab ich nichts davon gesehen
Jetzt bin ich der lebende Beweis dafür das die Geschichte sich auch dreht 
Bin nicht weit weg vom Ziel
Guck mal her ich krieg die Nikes jetzt for free und brauch
Dafür nicht am Stein mehr zu Dealen yeah 
Pump mal Azad aus dem Ghettoblaster 
In Schöneberg neben bei am dealen aber nie mit einen bösen Herz
Du bist nicht von hier und ich erkenne wie du Angst hast 
Standard sie boxen sich hier sogar mit den Amqas nein ich war nicht so wie all die andern
Ich gab ein fick auf jeden rapper in Berlin der irgenwie bekannt war 
Zwei drei mal gerappt und plötzlich war ich in der Sekte drin
Ich wusste das ist da der beste bin auch wen es verletzend klingt
Ich ging mein Weg alleine dann ist alles wie von Selbst passiert jetz bin ich hier und möchte Geld für mein CL kassieren 

Es war nicht immer so und heute weiß ich, 
Dass das ist mein Leben ich hab mir alles selber beigebracht

Verdammt an manchen Tagen gleicht dein leben einer Hetzjagd Olum 
Sei mal jetz stark du kannst mir wirklich glauben 
Das ich recht hab ich wurd nicht einfach so zu einen Rapstar
Die Leute haben gelestert sie meinten ihr vergesst das

Ich küsse deine Hand und halte sie an meine Stirn
Vater, Dank dir hatt' ich eine schöne Kindheit
Und wenn ich ehrlich bin, würd' ich so gern wieder ein Kind sein
Ich würd' so gern wieder in deinen Armen einschlafen
Glaub' mir, ich vermisse den Geruch an dei'm Kragen
Ich war der kleine Prinz auf dei'm Schoß
Es war wie mein Thron, ich war mehr als dein Sohn
Ich war ein Wunderkind und konnte schon mit sechs lesen
Und mein Bruder kam nicht klar mit diesen Nesthäkchen
Jetzt bin ich älter, danke Vater, nein, ich brauche nichts
Mir geht's gut, denn meine Alben, sie verkaufen sich
Ich will nur, dass du zufrieden bist, das reicht mir
Ich liebe dich und bin mit Herzem immer bei dir

Yeah, das ist für dich Vater
Du warst der Einzige, der jedes Mal für mich da war
Jetzt wird mir alles klar, damals hab' ich dich nicht verstanden
Du bist der beste Mensch auf dieser Welt
Yeah, ich liebe dich Vater
Du bist der Einzige auf dieser Welt, der mir nah war
Und dafür wollt' ich mich bei dir bedanken
Du bist und bleibst für mich der beste Mensch auf dieser Welt

Du hast für uns gearbeitet, wir waren zwar keine Bonzen
Wir waren glücklich, auch wenn wir uns nicht viel leisten konnten
Es war dein Traum, dass ich mit Fußball Karriere mache
Doch ich wollte auf die Straße, weil ich andere Pläne hatte
Das war genau die Zeit, nach meiner Pubertät
Ich war noch jung und oft mit falschen Leuten unterwegs
Ich habe Shit geraucht, auf der Straße Mist gebaut
Und in der Schule war ich faul und habe nix getaugt
Du hast an mich geglaubt, doch ich hab' dich enttäuscht
Mama hat nur geweint und du wolltest mich nicht mehr sehen
Doch du bist mein Zeuge, Vater, glaub' mir, ich habe es bereut
Damals war ich zornig, heute kann ich dich verstehen
Ich hab' mit allem aufgehört
Es war der falsche Weg, ich weiß, ich habe draus gelernt
Ich mach' das alles wieder gut, bitte verzeih' mir
Ich liebe dich und bin mit Herzem immer bei dir

Yeah, das ist für dich Vater
Du warst der Einzige, der jedes Mal für mich da war
Jetzt wird mir alles klar, damals hab' ich dich nicht verstanden
Du bist der beste Mensch auf dieser Welt
Yeah, ich liebe dich Vater
Du bist der Einzige auf dieser Welt, der mir nah war
Und dafür wollt' ich mich bei dir bedanken
Du bist und bleibst für mich der beste Mensch auf dieser Welt

Das Schlimmste, was du mir gesagt hast, war ""du Versager""
Du hast mich nie geschlagen, warst immer ein guter Vater
Ich bin stolz auf diesen Namen, den ich von dir trage
Alles, was ich von dir habe, werde ich mir stolz bewahren
Ich hab' dir noch so viel zu sagen, doch ich schaff' es nicht
Auch wenn ich's könnte, reichen dafür die paar Takte nicht
Und trotzdem sitz' ich hier und dachte mir, ich schreib' dir
Ich liebe dich und bin mit Herzem immer bei dir

Yeah, das ist für dich Vater
Du warst der Einzige, der jedes Mal für mich da war
Jetzt wird mir alles klar, damals hab' ich dich nicht verstanden
Du bist der beste Mensch auf dieser Welt

Doch sind wir ehrlich, so passt sie perfekt zu der Figur
Jetzt ist die Zeit vergangen, seit ich bei der Sekte war
Sitz im Studio und schreibe 16er für 16er
Nenn mich Jason Statham, Alpa Gun der Action-Star
Bitches reißen sich um mich, als wäre ich der Bachelor

Hallo allerseits, Tachchen oder ma-salaam
Deutsche Rapper trauen sich nicht mal auf 'ne Wasserbahn
Ich und meine Glatze sind wie Chris Tucker und Jackie Chan
Wir sind ein Dreamteam und Alpa ist der Kapitan
Es wäre besser, wenn ihr Pisser keine Faxen macht
Ich mein es ernst, Chabos wissen, wer 'ne Glatze hat
Ich komm aus Berlin, Alpa Gun ist nicht aus Harlem, Bitch
Alles kam zurück in meinem Leben, nur die Haare nicht
Damals dealte ich noch mit den Drogen auf der Straße
Heute gibt es jedes Jahr Promo und Reklame
Kay hat so viel Koks in seiner popeligen Nase
Rapper sind mir nicht gewachsen, so wie meine Haare
Alle rufen ""Boah, was?"", bin ich mal zu Gast in deiner Ortschaft
Denn sie lieben mich, weil ich Humor hab
Wenn ich vor dir steh ist es zu spät für dein Gequatsche

Ich weiß, der Haarausfall ist manchmal ziemlich abgefuckt
Das geht an jeden da draußen, der eine Glatze hat
Wir treffen uns und ziehen Cro seine Maske ab
Du solltest besser darauf aufpassen, was du machst
Ich grüße meinen Bruder Savas, der 'ne Glatze hat
Ich freu mich über jeden Rapper, der 'ne Glatze hat

Wir haben zwar Charme, doch können leider nicht romantisch sein
Motzen die Autos auf und fahren einmal ums Carree
Oder wir chillen und sitzen den ganzen Tag im Cafe
Rauchen ne Shisha oder spielen ne Runde Tavla
Die Frau geht einkaufen und macht zuhause sauber
Guck in der Ehe haben wir Männer die Hosen an
Auch ohne Job kommen wir irgendwie an Kohle ran
Ihr kommt einfach damit nicht klar, weil wir so anders wirken

Und kann in deinen Augen die Narben deiner Reise sehen
Du bist jetzt 25, bald geht es richtig los
Doch das einzig sichere an deinem Leben ist der Tod
Schon am Morgen bist du stoned
Die letzten Jahr ha'm sich nicht gelohnt
Du warst in der Zelle für ein bisschen Koks
Du wolltest rum haben, auf der Straße anerkannt sein
Doch nach allem anschein bist du nicht mehr angstfrei
Denn die letzten Jahre ließen dich fallen
Auch wenn kein Gitterstab mehr da ist, bist du nie wieder frei
Und du spürst, dass du gebrochen bist
Denn man macht unter der Woche nix, wenn man den ganzen Tag nur besoffen ist
Das muss jetzt aufhören, es wird Zeit ein Mann zu sein
Scheiß auf die Vergangenheit, dir bleibt nicht mehr lange Zeit
Ich kenn die Ausreden, ach Caney erzähl mir nichts

Es ist für gar nichts zu spät
Um es einzusehen
Es ist das Leben, was prägt
Und dir die Fährten legt
Guck es ist nicht vorbei, vorbei, vorbei
Das Leben fängt gerad' an

Yeah, setz dich Schwester, ich seh', dass du am Ende bist
Kurz vorm Aufgeben, sag mir, warum kämpfst du nicht
Glaub mir, dieses Leben endet einzig nur durch Gott allein
Sei jetzt eine starke Frau, warum bist du noch am Weinen
Jagst nach falschen Werten, weil du denkst, dass es dich glücklich macht
Doch Partys haben dir dein Lachen nie zurückgebracht
Du ziehst dich aus für sie, für irgendwelche Typen
Doch am nächsten Tag legt dir keiner mehr die Welt zu Füßen
Du sparst dein Geld für irgendwelche OPs
Was denkst du, denken sie, wenn sich deine Eltern so sehen
Ein so hübsches Mädchen, im Innern verloren
Schwester kämpf' gegen diese Stimmen im Ohr
Du hast Angst davor, dich nicht mehr um dein Image zu sorgen
Doch in meinen Augen beginnen nur Gewinner von vorn, yeah
Lass mal die Ausreden, Schwester, erzähl' mir nichts
Es ist für nichts zu spät, solang du noch am Leben bist

Es ist für gar nichts zu spät
Um es einzusehen
Es ist das Leben, was prägt
Und dir die Fährten legt
Guck es ist nicht vorbei, vorbei, vorbei
Das Leben fängt gerad' an

Yeah

Das Leben hält für jeden seine Prüfung bereit
Du musst aufhören, den ganzen Tag nur wütend zu sein
Gott sieht alles, nein, du kommst mit einer Lüge nicht weit
Und wenn du Gutes kriegen willst, musst du brüderlich teilen
Lass dich nie von falschen Werten blenden
Caney, auch wenn wir uns schwer ergänzen
Müssen wir den Hass in unserem Herz bekämpfen
Lasst uns aufwachen, es ist zu spät für nix
Solange du noch atmen kannst und noch am Leben bist

Ich wollte Freunde haben doch sie ließen mich allein
Was hab ich nur falsch gemacht?
Das kann doch nicht mein Schicksal sein
Manchmal hab ich draußen auf der Straße übernachtet
Ich wollte nur ein Gruß doch sie hab'm mich nicht beachtet
Ich wollte lieben dachte das mir jemand helfen kann
Doch die eine Frau die ich geliebt hab ist mir Fremd gegang'
Ich wollte helfen und der Mensch hat das nur ausgenutzt
Ich hab ihm Treue und mein Herz geschenkt doch er hat drauf gespuckt
Er hat mich angelächelt mit mir ein drauf gemacht
Doch hinter meim' Rücken war er falsch und hat mich ausgelacht
Der Mensch will alles haben doch ich wollte nichts der gleichen
Ich wollte einfach glücklich sein und vielleicht was erreichen
Ihr habt mich nie verstanden und werdet es auch nie tun
Den ihr habt nicht so ein Herz wie ich

Man ihr habt mich nie verstanden heute geht es nur noch um mich
Ich sah das gute in den Menschen oder war ich so blind?
Ich hab es nie verstanden warum denkt der Mensch nur an sich?
Ich wollte es nie glauben das die Menschen alle so sind

Ihr habt mich nie verstanden heute denk ich nur noch an mich
Ich sah das gute in den Menschen oder war ich so blind?
Ich hab es nie verstanden warum denkt der Mensch nur an sich?
Ich wollte es nie glauben das die Menschen alle so sind

Und jedes mal hat mich der Mensch belogen
Ich wollte Sauber sein doch er hat mich in Dreck gezogen
Ich wollte ehrlich sein und nichts von diesem Schwarzen Geld
Am Ende war ich Schuldig und wurde als Lügner dargestellt
Ich wollt nur gutes tun doch hab dafür ein Dreck bekomm'
Ich hab gelernt zu teilen doch sie hab'm mir alles weggenommen
Es kam von Herzen doch die Menschen haben das nicht erkannt
Ich mein ein Bitte oder Dankeschön ist nicht zu viel verlangt
Ich hab die ganze Zeit versucht ein guter Mensch zu sein
Und auch in schlechten Zeiten wollt' ich keine Schwäche zeigen
Ich wollte nur ein bisschen Glück doch hab nur Pech gehabt
Und trotzdem bin ich dankbar dafür das ich was zu Essen hab
Ich wollte nichts von euch und niemanden was böses tun
Ich musste kämpfen denn ich bin nicht so verwöhnt
Wie du doch ihr habt mich nie verstanden und werdet es auch nie tun

Jetzt bin ich abgehärtet

Mir geht es um Menschlichkeit

Ich hab zwar nicht so viel wie du und trotzdem reicht es mir

It's the same face every night
Under the bathroom light

Time to get dressed
And fast
Checking for keys and cash
Close the door

Head for the city
Letting the taxi cab
Find the way
Find your way

And when the evening's underway
Everyone feels ok
Watch my timing with champagne
And blissfully feel no pain

I catch a silhouette
I feel a smile
Like you found the way
Found your way

And time's come into play
You found your way
And time's come into play
Hurry up baby

Hurry up come to me

Lips curl to fight

Blood from the bite

Through that situation again, I'd like to catch 
That something in your eyes it thrilled me once again 
That gentle touch I can't describe 
It's like a reflection of the moon on the water 
Don't let it go, because of you the earth stood still 
Just do it again 
Burn, burn away, sacred letters, ragged backdrops 
I don't care, the certainty of death, 
The boring rituals of life they seem so far 
I don't care for my life, I just live for your love

From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?

Your heros for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

Swimming in a fish bowl,

Running over the same old ground.

I could try, but I'd never take it
Yell and I will never be heard

Losing in my sleep
Tired of taking history on the chin
I've been bleeding from the pressure lately

I won't fade out
I won't leave you behind
Everlasting love
And my heart is screaming
""hold on to me I won't leave you behind""
 
Trying but you cannot hide
To change this lock and key
Traded for some peace of mind

You left a note that your white fence was gone
Where is your head?
Stuck in a hole

It was the first time you had a chance 
And you gave it all up 
With nothing left
Stuck in a hole

And I feel like I'm in hell
Cause I tried to save myself
I didn't think I needed help
Was it too late, walking through the wasteland

Great light has kept my compass pointed 
Down in the dirt
I've got nothing left
Stuck in a hole

And the light shines into the darkest places
For a desperate heart when I was left
Stuck in a hole

And I feel like I'm in hell
Cause I tried to save myself
I didn't think I needed help
Was it too late, walking through the wasteland

Crawling through the wasteland
Looking for a true friend
Standing out with both ends

I don't wanna stay in",White Fences

Walked the face of earth
There've been watching for the time
No one needs to be mistaken
There's a place for you tonight

I will give you what you wishing
I will give you everything
And you will be so numb
I will be tying you up
You will never feel a thing

And I will come
For you

I will hold you
I will defend you

Our fight, this burning bed
See the bones that bullets have shattered
And I feel every drop of blood you've bled

Lay down these promises broken
Take me into your hurricane
While violent clouds roll over
I'll hold your hand till the colors fade
I'll be here till your dying day

Sing loud from the roof tops
Come dance on the rivers edge
Carry me over mountains to the end of love
Close the gates to the city
Hear the drums on the hillside
Carry me over mountains to the end of love

Standing in a field of voices
Find shelter from the blame
Even if you think it's all over

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

Put down the knife you're wielding
Let high stone walls fall away
With gentle time will be an ending
And I'll be here till the colors fade
And I'll be here till your dying day

Comme Sneazz, je me demande si ils sont prêts
Et aussi, est-ce qu'ils fileront le 'zeille
Sur cette immonde terre, je taffe comme une fourmi
Et je chill comme la cigale
Mais je compte voir les hirondelles, les arc-en-ciels, les champs de marguerites
Là où le temps n'est jamais perdu, là où le présent et l'avenir
Sont la même chose, tu captes?
Bref, un enième couplet que je pose
Cela veux dire une grande bouffée d'air pur
Comme les grands MC je ferai le job, respecte, car je rap pas, je respire
Demande a mon gars Veerus, plus le temps de glander
Le rap doit assurer nos rentes, rassurer nos rents-pa, car on a pas de plan B
Planqués dans l'ombre, nombreux sont ceux qui veulent me voir me planter
Les structures de rimes surgissent chaque jour
Je rap sur le rap, car a cause de lui je n'ai plus de vie
Je rimais déjà au lycée, normal qu'ils apprécient mes flows
Mais la majorité préfèrent lustrer la pine des autres
Fuck, je continue a piller le show
Grande salle ou petit appart', dans mon odyssée je suis comme Gyneco
Je cherche le nirvana, j'esquive les pires fanatiques et je respire Paname
Je constate qu'elles ont un penchant pour les déséquilibrés, donc je m'éloigne
Sinon je constate, les gens changent quand ils pensent que t'as du gent-gent

Accompagnés d'hydroponique médicale
On sera dans la légende genre Rakim et G rap, ou Big et Jigga
Quand j'aurai fait les films, séduit les Milf's, accomplis ma vengeance
Qui médira? Enfoiré, dis moi qui médira?
La tape de Flingue est folle, les rappeurs français y'en a plein que j'apprécie, mais très peu m'impressionnent
Après c'est une histoire de goûts, j'suis un Wack rappeur peut-être
Pend toi si ton rappeur préféré est le reflet de celui que tu as peur d'être
Tombe le masque, c'est dans l'ombre que je marche

As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company

 INSIDE OUT 
Lyrics: Gold/music: Gold-Lloyd-Echolette

Your hand full of hours - sand from the urns 
A travelling companion - the secret of ferns 
From darkness to darkness - where shall I begin 
When whiteness attacked us - sewn under our skin 
And there were the stars that helped to navigate our souls 
With all my love - I went into the world 
From inside out - and I gave it all to you 
But I need your love - that was looking for me 
Just on my lips look for your kiss 
And always I think where we might have gone 
If we'd never met inside this song 
Our names are enciphered - but the words became true 
When I was the sun and you, you were the moon 
And there were the stars that helped to navigate our souls 
      
      
INTO THE DARK 
Lyrics: Gold/music: Gold-Lloyd-Mertens

Long view into the dark 
Moving your finger 
You gonna make it for sure into the dark 
Master of duel, rendezvoyeur 
This is a walk into the dark 
Playing the ball 
Roll it on but not too fast 
There she goes into the light 
Close to your eye 
Breaking the mirror 
Gone out of sight 
Flash in the rain 
Sign of a walk into the dark..

IRON JOHN 
Lyrics: Gold-Rudy Nielson/music: Lloyd-Gold-Echolette
 
If you open up the cage 
You will hurt yourself 
The king said it's forbidden 
Or you may get hell 
But the prisoner lets you know 
Where to find the key 
Under her satin pillow 
Yes, there it has to be 
Modesty is fine but it doesn't take you very far 
When you make your decision 
Don't be afraid of the dark 
Longing for the golden ball 
That it will be yours for keeps 
Be sure about it as you saw 
So shall you reap 
Lets take a ride on iron john's shoulders 
He has more gold than anybody in this world 
Lets tak a ride, hey-ho on iron john 
He has more gold 
Than anybody in this world 
Jump on the train to nowhere 
From now on you are free 
After rising from the ashes 
You'll become a mystery 
Too many of those strange injections, 
Too many gazes at the sun 
The lady says, well that's the business, 
Running after no.1 
For all their childish daydreams 
You caught their falling stars 
Just for the cheapest contracts 
You signed your autograph 
And if you started much too early, 
Therefore you stopped too late 
Make sure no one can stop you now, 
Here comes the ultimate 
He will be with you, he will be there 
When you call out the magic words..

From my little hideaway 
My sweet ivory tower 
I've sent you songs about so many things 
Mighty moondogs skipping waves 
Dolphins playing their lives away 
Golden circus girls and pharaohs 
Fallen angels, streetside romeos 
Patricia's park and anyway 
Eternal youth and neverending summerdays 
Lonely girls, music halls, the mysteries of love 
In the event 
That I don't return

And it's just for you
You've got a reservation
For the 17th of June

Open your eyes and let the sun break in for a while
There may be something
That you've never seen inside

Feel how your heart beats
Like a heavy machine
The sound of the traffic
Is like a silent dream

The dust in the park
The exhaust from the cars
Ascends in that heated afternoon
(You touch a sweaty body)

Summer in Berlin, it's alright
The day feels so tired
From the lead in the air
And the fire in the skies

Life seemed to be a fault of grace
But it's okay
It gave you a kiss
In the middle of the crossroads

What do I do 
Playing my tune for you 
Just to get you in the mood

And I skate on a knife on a wire 
That is strung from this song to a distant shore

Intuition is just another phase of chance 
While we're crawling through the old pyramid's floors

And the little black dog, here it comes again 

It's a true companion in a foreign land 
On a quest for the valley of boojums
And birthdays and phonecalls I cannot recall

And the man at the helm shall talk to no one

And the echo of her voice filled the empty places in my dreams

As pale reflections play on the deserted road 
I hear a humming of machines 

A distant sound like thunder 
Crawling through the cold

I run around in circles without end

That is because you haunt me so
I wasn't right to let you go away
I try to kill the pain inside

Much too much impact of obscene terror 
I wonder why I'm still surfing on this wave of obsession 
Is there a reason to stay any longer 
Waiting for some cool messiah 
Give me a reason to stay here forever 
Waiting for something to come 
Is it my soul 
Is it that glimpse of light I never forget to expect 
Or is it you, some kind of angel 
That keeps me in waiting forever 
There's too much war on the outside 
Much too much impact of symbols and meanings 
I wonder why I'm still fighting in this ocean of questions

Let it all out, please let me out of here 
And I shall rise from the ashes 

Grow like a rose from the ruins 
There must be light in the darkness 
Hope at the end of the night 
Yes, I've been tryin' all my 
Life to get to heaven 
But awoke in the eye of the storm 
But I shall rise from the ashes
Grow from the ruins and return back home 

This is a call from the goals coming up 
To the prisoners of pleasure 
Drunk on the blood of the next generations 
And I've been through many strange confusions
Splitting myself into to many faces 
Now the mirror is broken
I can see the worms behind 
You may well have your ways of triumph
You may well have your ways of truth 

Just gimme some room to breathe
That's all that I need

We all belong to the grand astral body 
Take my hand and I take you out of here 
And there's you behind those legendary curtains 
Take my hand before you wither in the crowd 

And I take you out of here

Slow and gentle, sentimental

Dance on moonbeams, slide on rainbows
In furs or blue jeans, you know what i mean

If you feel blue look through who's who
See La Goulue and Nijinsky

It's late and I want to sleep

It's called Miracle Healing
I read it on a sign somewhere in Port of Spain

(29. 4. 2000)

I remember a bright-blue-colonial building
For me it looked like the entrance to paradise
A place full of smiling people, a place full of happiness
I was dreaming to go there

Instead of doing the interview & receive...
A miracle healing of innocence & ectasy
Dreams of independence
Love, caress & energy

The circle & square, sound & vision, angels are singing
You're gonna burn in hell no more
You're gonna burn in hell no more...
Are you sure what to think of me?

Do you know how I should be?
Is there any damn explanation for this world?
And what kind of healing would I need?
Only one thing I know is that I need some help

I must finish this song to find it all out
A miracle healing...

Hello my friend!
It's late and I want to sleep
And I'm sitting here all alone with my ghosts tonite
I don't know what to write to you
I just want to say that I'm thinking of you

And I hope that you're alright
I am, well, ...better
I think it must be because of this letter
And if it's not so then I really don't have a clue

Would you resurrect me from the dead
Would you light up my darkness
would you give me...

The ground to be his bed

So much your heart's become fond of this

Oh, let me whisper like the rubbing hands
Of tourists in Verona
I just want to love you in my own language

Good like burning wood

To two thirsty girls from Hornsea
Who left a note when morning came

Girls from the pool say ""Hi"" (hi)
The road erodes at five feet per year
Along England's east coastline
Was this your first time?

Have all the fun in life

Altan,"Lately last night, I was asked to a wedding
The wedding of a fair maid who proved to me unkind
For that day as she thought of her intended young lover
Thoughts of her old one had run through her mind

Supper being over and all things were ended
Every young man was to sing a fine song
Until it came to the turn of her own foreign lover
And the song that he sang to the bride did belong

How can you sit at another man's table
How can you drink of another man's wine
How can you lie in the arms of another
Many's the night, love, that you lay in mine

Many's the one has been seven years parted
Seven years parted and did return again
But I have only been two years away, love
Two years away, love, and did return again

The bride, she was seated at the head of the table
Very well she knew to whom the song did belong
Her heart it grew faint, she could stand it no longer
Down at the feet of the bridegroom she fell

Sobbing and sighing she rose from the table
Sobbing and sighing she went to her bed
Early next morning the bridegroom awakened
He turned to embrace her and found she was dead

Saying, ""Annie, dear Annie, I knew you never loved me
My love and your love could never agree
For I knew all along that your poor heart was breaking
All for the sake of a foreign young man""

So now I must wear a frock of deep mourning
A frock of deep mourning, one, two and three
I must wear to her wake my own wedding garment
Ne'er again shall I go between the bark and the tree",A Nobleman's Wedding

Down by Blackwaterside
'Twas a-gazing all around me
That the Irish lad I spied

All through the far part of the night
We did lie in sport and play
When this young man arose and gathered his clothes
Saying, ""Fare thee well today""

That's not the promise that you gave to me
When you lay on my breast
You could make me believe with your lying words
That the sun rose in the west

Go home, go home to your father's garden
Go home and weep your fill
And think on your own misfortune
You brought on with your want and will

For there's not a girl in this whole wide world
As easily led as I
And when fishes can fly and the seas run dry
It is then that you'll marry I
It is then that you'll marry I",Blackwaterside

Altan,"The trees, they grow high, and the leaves, they do grow green
Many is the time my true love I've seen
Many an hour I watched him all alone
He's young but he's daily growing

Father, dear father, you've done me great wrong
You have married me to a boy who is too young
I am twice twelve and he is but fourteen
He's young but he's daily growing

Daughter, dear daughter, I've done you no wrong
I have married you to a great lord's son
And he will be a man for you when I am dead and gone
He's young but he's daily growing

Father, dear father, if you see fit
We'll send him to college for another year yet
I'll tie a blue ribbon all around his head
To let the maidens know that he is married

One day I was looking over my father's castle wall
I spied all the boys playing with a ball
And my own true love, he was the flower of them all
He's young but he's daily growing

And so early in the morning at the dawning of the day
They went into a hayfield for to have some sport and play
And what they did there she never would declare
But she never more complained of his growing

At the age of fourteen he was a married man
At the age of fifteen, the father of my son
At the age of sixteen, his grave, it was green
And death had put an end to his growing

I'll buy my love some flannel, I'll make my love a shroud
And every stitch I put in it, the tears, they'll pour down
Amd every stitch I put in it, how the tears, they will flow
Cruel fate has put an end to his growing",Daily Growing [Song]
Altan,"This pretty young maid I seek far and wide
My heartache each morn with her I don't meet
When I go to the bar, the dance hall or fete
But I'd follow her trail in the dead of the night

Now you're the young man that travels afar
Find me a gem I can have as my wife
Never yearn or pine for flocks or for kine
And I'll conjure plan that will charm her life

Have her youthful and fair with no worry or care
Patient and wise in affairs of all kind
Modest and mild, without too much pride
That is my love if she hadn't a dime

Now you're the young man that travels afar
Find me a gem I can have as my wife
Never yearn or pine for flocks or for kine
And I'll conjure plan that will charm her life

Let no blemish or shame be attached to her name
Honest in heart and gentle in mien
No hatred or vice to be heard in her voice
But cheerful and smiling from morning 'til night

Now you're the young man that travels afar
Find me a gem I can have as my wife
Never yearn or pine for flocks or for kine
And I'll conjure plan that will charm her life

Altan,"When first I went a sea-apprentice bound
I sailed the salt seas all 'round and 'round
I scarce had sailed a voyage but one
When I fell in love with my charming Anne

I went to my captain both stout and bold
And unto him my secret told
I love yon lass as I love my life
What would I give if she were my wife?

Well, the captain said, ""You're a foolish boy
For to court a girl that you'll ne'er enjoy
For she'll have lovers while you're at sea
And she'll be married e're you'll be free""

Well, I don't know but I'll go and try
For she might fancy an apprentice boy
And she might alter her mind for me
And wait on me until I be free

Well, I bought her ribbons, I bought her gloves
These things to prove of a heart that loves
She accepted all and she was not shy
And she vowed to wait for her apprentice boy

When my ship is anchored and my work is over
I'll steer my barque for sweet Erin's shore
In my native country, my love I'll enjoy
And she'll welcome home her apprentice boy

So come all you sea-apprentices where e'er you be
Never slight your true love while you're at sea
Just love her as you love your life
And she'll consent to become your wife

There be many a good man's daughter with
Her hair all hanging down

But my bed is empty 
I know I am too set in my ways
Tell all I am okay

So burn it down
Discover the dusk of your day 
Has reached its dawn
So burn it down
Remember to find a new to carry on

Flew so high last night I think that I fell
To the ground so heavy 
Woke up to find this living hell
It used to be so easy 
Hard to tell my nights now from my days
The curtains hide my feelings 
Don't feel I have any right to pray
And they will find me someday, someday 

So burn it down
Discover the dusk of your day 
Has reached its dawn
So burn it down
Remember to find a new to carry on
So burn it down
Discover the dusk of your day 
Has reached its dawn
So burn it down
Remember to find a new to carry on

Whatever takes us anyway
Will be the same to drive us on
Whatever takes us anyway
Will be the same to drive us on

Remember to find a new way
A way to see it all
We're finally slipping away
And soon it will be gone
Remember to find a new day
Remember to carry on

So burn it down
Discover the dusk of your day
Has reached its dawn
So burn it down
Remember to find a new way to carry on

So burn it down
Discover the dusk of your day
Has reached its dawn
So burn it down
Remember to find a new way to carry on, oh

I will find the meaning this time

The face of a stranger

I hunger for more
Cause I'm selfish
And all I'm left with
Is a crown of thorns
And I'm helpless

Yesterday is gone, we can't go back again
Do you ever cry for the ghost of days gone by

I remember summer days
We were young and unafraid
With innocence we'd glide beneath the stars

It seems so long ago
Beyond the life that I now know
Before the years would have their way and break my heart

Do you feel the same
For what was remained
Yesterday is gone, we can't go back again
Do you ever cry for the ghost of days gone by

And I know it's drawing closer
With each day I feel the end

Don't wanna die, don't wanna die

I don't wanna die

Altiyan Childs,"I got my first real six-string
Bought it at the five-and-dime
Played it till my fingers bled
Was the summer of '69

Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit, Jody got married
Shoulda known, we'd never get far

Oh when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Yeah, I'd always want to be there
Those were the best days of my life

Ain't no use in complainin'
When you got a job to do
Spent my evenings down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

Oh yeah
Back in the summer of '69
Ohhh

Man we were killin' time
We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothin' can last forever, forever, no

And now the times are changin'
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old six-string
Think about you wonder what went wrong

How you spending for my ship and then you still ain't hitting

Can't you see me, nobody get me, and I will hurt feelings
Yeah, so keep your hands up off me
I get it if I want it, I don't care what you bought me

Uh, take cover, my girls all hover
When we see a creep, we put 'em to sleep, uh
Macaroni Tony in a ditch
'Cause he grabbed my ass and called me a bitch

Got wolves around the world, coulda sent one of my juniors

On Friday night, and I feel all right.
The party's here on the West side
So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver, take the keys to my truck
Hit the floor cause I'm faded
Honeys in the street say, Monty, yea you made it!
It feels so good in my hood tonight
The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani
All the gang bangers forgot about the drive-by
You gotta get your groove on, before you gonna get paid
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up

I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because

(This is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back

This is how we do it, all hands are in the air
And we wave 'em from here to there
If you're an O.G. mack or a wanna-be player
You see the hood's been good to me
Ever since I was a lower-case G
Now I'm a big G; boys say I've got the money
Hundred-dollar bills y'all
If you were from where I'm from then you would know
That I gotta get mine in a big black truck
You can get yours in a 64

And I know that there's someone who's in wanderlust with you

If I knew better, I would stay here
Taking all my luck as it comes
But when I met a lady fortune
I swallowed, swallowed wanderlust

Dancing away the dead gone days

Burning deep into the night

E poi non dirmi che è un'illusione
E poi non dirmi che è un'illusione
   
E io sì t'avrei trovata per far l'amore

Lascia il tuo viso scivolare piano
Lasciati sola senza una ragione
Lasciati sola senza troppa intenzione

Non ti ascolto se mi chiedi domani
Siamo ancora insieme come stasera

El hermano del destino
Nunca solo me sentí

Subiendo la cuesta al horizonte
El bolsillo de polvo se llenó
Apariencias que tal vez confunden
Cicatrices cuentan que pasó

Cuando no supe seguir

Y yo no pude explicar porque tenía
Que pasarlo mal, y no lo vi

Me duele la distancia, solo quiero estar
Perdido en tus abrazos en qualquier lugar

Grabar en mi corazón la imagen
Que quise guardar
Para recordarla siempre y así solo
Yo nunca tendría que estar

Grabar el sabor de aquel café
Después de pasear
Por las calles del pueblo perdidos en Sant Cugat
Para recordarlo siempre y así un rato

Me duele la distancia, solo quiero estar
Perdido en tus abrazos en qualquier lugar

Te miro y me sonríes, vuelvo a preguntar
¿Y cuándo volverás?

Recuerdos que un día dejé atrás
Me dan la ilusión
Para yo acordarme siempre que
Hay alguien esperando con razón

Me duele la distancia, solo quiero estar
Perdido en tus abrazos en qualquier lugar

Volver a llenar tus ojos de alegría junto al mar
Y tengo esperanza que si tú no me encuentras
Seguro lo haré yo
Sí lo haré yo

Why mas aun que te hallas fiado de mi.
Te jugaste todo a nada al quererme
Pero te juro que no te vas arrepentir.

why no te miento cuando digo que te amo
Que yo sin ti ya no podria vivir,
Pongo el alma why la vida en tus manos
Para que sepas que tu eres todo para mi.

Nada se compara contigo las emociones mas profundas
Why tantas iluciones juntas
Solo he podido descubrirlas junto a ti,
Tu me fascinas why eres la tentacion mas exquisita.

Nada se compara contigo no tuve amor mas impetuoso
Why la pasion que en ti derrocho
Why aunque parezca fantacioso es asi de lo vivido
Nada se compara contigo.

why no te miento cuando te digo que te amo
Que yo sin ti ya no podria vivir
Pongo el alma why la vida en tus manos
Para que sepas que tu eres todo para mi.

Alvaro Torres,"Hacía tanto que no me detenía
A contemplarte que había olvidado
Hasta la sensación de disfrutarte
Pero hoy bajé hasta el fondo de tu vientre
Hasta ahí donde se vive de esperanza
De donde un día yo me fui a buscar mi suerte

El tiempo vuela que hare
Que en estas calles yo era un niño
Como cualquiera ganándome la vida en mil oficios
En el barrio ya no hay nadie conocido
Nuevas vidas han brotado why pido al cielo
Que dios bendiga el futuro de estos niños

Toma esta canción patria querida
Escrita con nostalgia why con melancolía
Es mi corazón el que se inspira
Pues en la distancia te añoro cada día

Toma esta canción patria querida
Escrita con nostalgia why con melancolía
Es mi corazón el que se inspira
Pues en la distancia te añoro cada día

Tú estás más bella cualquiera
Pensaría que no has sufrido
Por que las huellas las has
Cubierto con perdón why olvido
Muchas cosas han pasado en estos años
Pero quiero que se enteren mis amigos
Que todavía los recuerdo why los extraño

Entre mis manos, a verte conocido Están hermoso q
Aun no salgo de mi asombro, te juro q me gustas

De amor why mil deseos, de ti no cuesta nada

Enamorarse, amarte es como amar aun ángel, no
Quiero despertar si esto es un sueño, mi ángel de
Amor mi alma es tuya desde el día q te vi sin duda
Alguna yo he nacido para ti pase lo q pase, mi

Angel de amor quien descifra la emoción de amarte
Así, se quedan cortas cortas mis palabras al
Decir q te amo mas q ah nadie en este mundo

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain

Alvin Stardust,"I stood stone-like at midnight, suspended in my masquerade
I combed my hair till it was just right and commanded the night brigade
I was open to pain and crossed by the rain and I walked on a crooked crutch
I strolled all alone through a fallout zone and come out with my soul untouched
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd, but when they said, ""Sit down,"" I stood up
Ooh...growin' up

The flag of piracy flew from my mast, my sails were set wing to wing
I had a jukebox graduate for first mate, she couldn't sail but she sure could sing
I pushed b-52 and bombed them with the blues with my gear set stubborn on standing
I broke all the rules, strafed my old high school, never once gave thought to landing
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd, but when they said, ""Come down,"" I threw up
Ooh...growin' up

I took month-long vacations in the stratosphere, and you know it's really hard to hold your breath
I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared, I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress
Well, my feet they finally took root in the earth, but I got me a nice little place in the stars
And I swear I found the key to the universe in the engine of an old parked car
I hid in the mother breast of the crowd, but when they said, ""Pull down,"" I pulled up
Ooh...growin' up

Alvin Terry,"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance

Lord, you can seek, you know what I mean

So make her feel that she's for real and she'll give you happiness

If you fail to do this, don't blame her if she looks my way

Alvino Rey,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

If it's just band music or rhythm and blues
Just go and listen
It'll start with a smile
It won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
Your feet start tapping
And you can't seem to find
How you got there
So just blow your mind

Do you believe in magic?
Come along with me
We'll dance until morning, just you and me
And maybe, if the music the right
I'll meet ya tomorrow
So late at night

We'll go a dancin' baby then you'll see
All the magic's in the music and the music's in me, yeah

Do you believe in magic? Yeah.
Believe in the magic in a young girl's soul
Believe in the magic of rock n roll
Believe in the magic that can set you free

A mannequin looks more alive
Haven't meant a word, I've written here

It's not snow, it's rain coming down
And the lights are cool but they burn out
And I can't pull off the cheer
Not this year, not this year, not this year

No happiness is present here
Not supposed to whine, not supposed to cry
Try to hold it in but not at this time

I will, I will speak louder for you

I won't forget that day
The sunlight open my eyes
First kiss on the beach is like paradise

Cali, Cali, Cali, California
I won't forget that night
The palm trees swinging above
One touch and I knew it was California love

Oooh, oh
I'm dreaming of a sunny place
Where the ocean waves fill up my mind
I forget about everything
And I just sit back and I really don't whine

But life ain't going that way
When you don't have enough power to stop
All these crazy situations you find yourself in
But you can't get out of

Texas heat, it drives me crazy
But it don't matter cause in my mind

Cali, Cali, Cali, California love
Cali, Cali, Cali, California

If I could just feel the sand in my toes
And remind myself that there is some hope
Realizing I'm the only one
Who's got enough power to save my soul

But mama I swear to you,
When I get there, everything's gonna be better
But it's still 1,000 miles away from home
Wanna hurry up and get there

Texas heat, it drives me crazy
But it don't matter cause in my mind

Cali, Cali, Cali, California
I won't forget that day
The sunlight open my eyes
First kiss on the beach is like paradise

Cali, Cali, Cali, California
I won't forget that night
The palm trees swinging above
One touch and I knew it was California love

Texas heat, it drives me crazy
I wanna chill out, baby I'm feeling lazy
Everyday's the same and it brings me down
But it don't matter cause soon I'll be there

I won't forget that day
The sunlight open my eyes

I came out the other side

Another day
Another reason why I'm alone
You said you'd stay
But lately I've been standing on my own

Here it goes
You said it wouldn't stop
When the records starts to drop
You'll hear me loud and clear

And I know you can't wait
Your belligerent hate
There's no place like home
There's no place like home

There's a little white porch
And you wanted it so
Can you let me go down
To the end of the road
In the black and the white
A techni-colorful life
Can I stand by your side?
We can make it alright

Words cannot express

I wish I could turn back time

Where love had no end
And you and me were as one

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,

If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Eu vou a praça recordar o que passou
Ando em silêncio entre as plantas do jardim
E sinto em tudo a presença do amor
De vez em quando sinto algo diferente
Então procuro na penumbra um rosto amigo
O meu desejo vai queimando pouco a pouco
Até parece que você esta comigo
Com um sorriso meio triste no meu rosto
Vou recordando as nossas noites com carinho
Naquela hora em que todos se completam
É que percebo que só eu estou sozinho

Sentado na praça eu fico sem graça
Olhando os casais que passam por mim
Parece um castigo eu penso comigo
Meu Deus até quando isso vai ser assim
Ali sentado vou sofrendo meu castigo
Misturo a dor com a vontade de esquecer
Os casais fazendo amor vão sussurrando
Todas as frases que eu queria lhe dizer
Você trocou a nossa praça tão bonita
Pelo conforto dos motéis la da cidade
Você terá toda riqueza que sonhou
Mas certamente não terá felicidade
Enquanto isso vou vivendo de lembranças
Das nossas noites ali mesmo no jardim
A esperança é a última que morre
Quem sabe um dia
Você vai voltar pra mim",Sentado Na Praça
Amado Batista,"Foi lá pelos anos 60, o mês eu não me lembro mais
Eu andava noite adentro, a procura de amor e de paz
Fui parar num bordel, lugar distante do céu
Morada do satanás

Parece que foi um castigo, de fato não me controlei
Ao ver aquela mulher linda sentada na mesa do canto
Me envolvi em seus encantos, por ela me apaixonei

E por orgulho ou vaidade, eu nunca contei pra ninguém
Temia a lingua do povo, temia a sociedade
E fui levando essa paixão sempre na obscuridade

Porém um dia lá cheguei pra encontrar com ela
Não vendo ela no salão por ela procurei
Fiquei sabendo que ela estava no quarto vendendo
O amor que eu neguei

Me completamente louco de arma na mão
Quebrando a porta do quarto atirei sem perdão
Não pude fugir da justiça o preço do amor eu
Paguei na prisão

E depois de tantos anos eu já cumpri minha sentença
Hoje estou livre das grades mas preso pela consciência
Por matar um desconhecido na mais completa inocência

Portanto meu prezado amigo, se acaso lhe acontecer
De amar uma mulher da vida, você nunca deve esconder
Não faça jamais como eu fiz, matar uma pobre infeliz
Pelo amor que ela foi vender",Não Faça Jamais Como Eu Fiz
Amado Batista,"Acorde amor!
Não deixe o homem que te ama sem o teu calor
Não deixe as tristezas desse mundo todas para mim
Não vá, não vá embora

Foram quase doze anos de vida vivida em comum
No outro mundo não te deixarão entrar sem mim
Acorde amor!
Acorda a alma

Diga que está fingindo
Diga qualquer coisa pelo amor de Deus
Diga que está com sono
Que foi só um remédio que você bebeu

Um deles é ter casa bonita
Se esquecendo de cuidar do seu marido
Enfraquecendo seu amor que é tão bonito

E eu não acreditando nesta ideia
Fiz tudo que podia e não podia
Construí a nossa casa tão sonhada
Com jardins, cheia de flores e muralhas

Mas isso não foi bastante
Pra você poder ficar
Foi embora e nem se lembra
De voltar pra me buscar

E agora olho esta casa tão bonita
E lembro que era tudo o que queria

Você foi matando nosso amor, querida

Sei que você era vaidosa
Por isso fiz das tripas coração
Pra ver você feliz e orgulhosa
Pois não ligo, já dormi até no chão

E entre os sonhos que tivemos
Um foi ter casa bonita
E o outro amar eternamente
