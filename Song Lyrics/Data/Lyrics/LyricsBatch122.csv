Flop,"I kissed the letter that you sent to me
I realize now that you are the one to
(Three, four, five)
You are the passport to the sanitarium
And all the records that you stole from me

[Chorus]
I realize now that you are the one to 
See it through
I cornered you at the Woolworth
Now my wish came true
They said to talk to you
I wasn't going to

I read the letter that you sent to me
I sympathize with what you have to go through

You wear your face up like a true chameleon
And all the hours that you stole from me

Floppy Sounds,"Hey!  Life, look at me, I can see the reality,
'Cause when you shook me, took me outta my world, I woke up.
Suddenly I just woke up to The Happening.
When you find that you left the future behind.
'Cause when you got a tender love you don't take care of, 
then you better beware of,
 
The Happening.
One day you're up, when you turn around,
You find your world is tumbling down.
It happened to me and it can happen to you.
 
I was sure, I felt secure until love took a detour.
Yeah!  Riding high on top of the world, it happened.
Suddenly it just happened, 
I saw my dreams torn apart 
when love walked away from my heart.
And when you lose a precious love you need to guide you 
something happens inside you,
 
The Happening.
Now I see life for what it is.
It's not of dreams, it's not of bliss.
It happened to me and it can happen to you
And then it happened.
Oo, and then it happened.
Oo, and then it happened.
 
Is it real?  Is it fake?
Is this game of life a mistake?
'Cause when I lost the love I thought was mine for certain,
Suddenly it starts hurtin'.
I saw the light too late when that fickle finger of fate.
Yeah!  It came and broke my pretty balloon,
I woke up, suddenly I just woke up, so sure,
I felt secure until love took a detour.
'Cause when you got a tender love you don't take care of,
then you better beware of,
The Happening.
The Happening.

Flor Yvon,"No me conoces aun
Por que lo nuestro fue tan pasional
Que no nos dimos la oportunidad,
De decirnos cosas de amor de verdad

No me conoces aun
Las emociones que te hice sentir
Son solamente los días de abril
Nos quedan a4os de amor por vivir

Ven a mi casa, abrázame
Hazme el amor
Pero esta vez con una mirada
No te conozco
No me conoces a mi
Sorpresas hay por vivir

No me conoces aun
Porque dejamos correr el reloj
Entre caricias y haciendo el amor
Sin conocernos un poco mejor

No me conoces aun
Y nos amamos sin ganas de amar
Y nos besamos por tan solo besar
Vamos a darnos la oportunidad

Ven a mi casa, abrázame
Hazme el amor
Pero esta vez con una mirada
No te conozco
No me conoces a mi
Sorpresas hay por vivir

Ven a mi casa, abrázame

Good morning heartache, thought we said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone

Wish I'd forget you, but you're here to stay
It seems I met you when my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you
Good morning heartache, what's new

Stop haunting me now
Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning heartache, here we go again
Good morning heartache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hanging around

Like the kicker in a julep or two

That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

Everybody in the club trying to make it rain
But not for famine just for the sake of habit
Fifteen minutes of fame and everything's the same
Again and again I see the same thing
Everybody acting like they their plane sailin'
I see rough seas ahead maybe a recession
And then a depression in whatever profession
This is my confession I cant fight I'm in the forefront
Living for money ready to start like a bungee jump
With no rope but I ain't trying to see the bottom
Because that's were I came from, I ain't forgotten

The breath that carried me
The sigh that blew me forward

'Cause it was trapped
Trapped between two lungs
It was trapped between two lungs
It was trapped between two lungs

And my running feet could fly
Each breath screaming
""We are all too young to die""

Between two lungs it was released
The breath that passed from you to me
That flew between us as we slept
That slipped from your mouth into mine
It crept between two lungs
It was released
The breath that passed from you to me
That flew between us as we slept
That slipped from your mouth into mine
It crept

'Cause it was trapped
Tapped between two lungs
It was trapped between two lungs

Now all the days of begging
The days of theft
No more gasping for a breath
The air has filled me head-to-toe
And I can see the ground far below
I have this breath
And I hold it tight
And I keep it in my chest
With all my might
I pray to God this breath will last
As it pushes past my lips
As I gasp

The breath that passed from you to me",Between Two Lungs

No more dreaming like a girl so in love, so in love
No more dreaming like a girl so in love with the wrong world

And all around the world was waking, I never could go back

In the shadow of your heart

But then it stopped, and I was in the darkness,
So darkness I became

No dawn, no day, I'm always in this twilight

I took the stars from our eyes, and then I made a map
And knew that somehow I could find my way back

It couldn't wash the echoes out

Like some child possessed, the beast howls in my veins
I want to find you, tear out all of your tenderness

And howl, howl
Howl, howl

Be careful of the curse that falls on young lovers
Starts so soft and sweet and turns them to hunters

Until I wrap myself inside your arms I cannot rest
The saints can't help me now, the ropes have been unbound

The hardest of hearts
The hardest of hearts
The hardest of hearts

There is love in our bodies and it holds us together
But pulls us apart when we're holding each other
We all want something to hold in the night
We don't care if it hurts or we're holding too tight

There is love in your body but you can't get it out
It gets stuck in your head, won't come out of your mouth
Sticks to your tongue and it shows on your face
That the sweetest of words have the bitterest taste

Darling heart, I loved you from the start
But you'll never know what a fool I've been
Darling heart, I loved you from the start
But that's no excuse for the state I'm in

The hardest of hearts
The hardest of hearts
The hardest of hearts

My heart swells like a water at work
Can't stop myself before it's too late
Hold on to your heart
'Cause I'm coming to take it
Hold on to your heart
'Cause I'm coming to break it

Hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on
Hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on

About my old school
And she was there all pink and gold and glittering
I threw my arms around her legs
Came to weeping (came to weeping)
Came to weeping (came to weeping)

And I heard your voice
As clear as day
And you told me I should concentrate
It was all so strange
And so surreal
That a ghost should be so practical
Only if for a night

And the only solution was to stand and fight
And my body was bruised and I was set alight
But you came over me like some holy rite
And although I was burning, you're the only light
Only if for a night

And the grass was so green against my new clothes
And I did cartwheels in your honour
Dancing on tiptoes
My own secret ceremonials
Before the service began
In the graveyard doing handstands

And I heard your voice
As clear as day
And you told me I should concentrate
It was all so strange
And so surreal
That a ghost should be so practical
Only if for a night

And the only solution was to stand and fight
And my body was bruised and I was set alight

And although I was burning, you're the only light

And prayers and proclamations in the grand days
Of great men and the smallest of gestures
In short shallow gasps

And the words are all escaping me
And coming back all damaged
And I would put them back in poetry

And I would give all this and heaven too
I would give it all if only for a moment

And sings to me inside

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence","How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful [Demo / Bonus Track]"

It just gains its strength and digs its hooks
To drag me through the day

I can't keep calm, I can't keep still
Pulled apart against my will

Say it's the thing to do
But it's hard to see it when you're in it

Then you leave my head and crawl out of bed
Subconscious [?]
And for those hours deep in the dark
Perhaps you don't exist

Every stone in this city keeps reminding me
Can you protect me from what I want?

Mother, make me
Make me a big tall tree
So I can shed my leaves and let it blow through me
Mother, make me
Make me a big grey cloud
So I can rain on you things I can't say out loud

All these couples are kissing
And I can't stand the heat
I lost my shoes and left the party
I wander in the street

I put my feet into the fountain
The statues all asleep
No use wishing on the water
It grants you no relief

Mother, make me
Make me a bird of prey
So I can rise above this, let it fall away
Mother, make me
Make me a song so sweet
Heaven trembles, fallen at our feet

À dire au revoir
Les yeux dans les yeux
Dans le noir
Sans ton regard
Je saurai peut être mieux

M'en veut pas
Si je te parais lâche
Pour tout ce que je gâche

J'me dis parfois
C'est par peur d'être heureux

Je ne sais pas parler d'amour
Je ne sais pas demander pardon
J'ai toujours peur d'être en dessous
Que tu m'ais attendu
Et puis t'avoir déçu
Il faudra toujours entre nous
Ne pas tricher ni se mentir non
Mais au fond de toi saurais-tu?
Me dire en face que
Que tu ne m'aimes plus

J'arrive pas a m'en aller
À me dire que ça serait mieux
Je ne peux pas baisser les bras
Et encore moins baisser les yeux

M'en veux pas
Si je manque de courage
Si je rêve d'autres voyages
Si à chaque fois je ne fais que m'enfuir

Dis moi quand tu rentres, que je me réveille

À toi, à toi et me voilà aujourd'hui

D'être seul pour toute une vie

Elle est arrivée là rien que pour toi

Pour la vie ou pour la nuit
Tu veux l'avoir tu veux savoir
Pour l'envie ou pour l'ennui
Tu veux pouvoir y croire
Tu veux pouvoir avoir trouvé
Celle qui faut pas chercher
Celle que t'attends en séduisant
En les aimant en les aimant
Jusqu'à les oublier

Elle te dit oui elle te dit non
Elle a envie oh et puis non
Elle te sourit elle est à toi
Elle est ta vie elle est plus là
T'as rien vu tu t'en fous
T'as perdu et c'est tout
Ou alors
Elle te dit non mais elle dit oui
Elle redit non elle a envie
Elle est à toi tu l'as vaincue
Elle est ta vie mais t'en veux plus
Elle a rien vu tu t'en fous
T'as perdu et c'est tout

Dans ta vie ou dans tes nuits
Tu veux l'avoir tu veux savoir
Dans l'envie ou dans l'ennui
Tu veux pouvoir y croire
Tu veux pouvoir un jour trouver
Celle qui faut pas chercher
Celle que t'attends en séduisant
En les aimant en attendant
Jusqu'à les oublier
Mais un jour elle apparaît
Elle est là et tu le sais
Elle te regarde elle te connaît
Elle est encore plus belle en vrai
Tu es certain que plus rien
Ne pourra arrêter ça

Pour la vie pas pour la nuit
Ju vais l'avoir je vais savoir
Pour l'envie pas pour l'ennui
Je veux encore y croire
Je veux pouvoir avoir trouvé
Celle qu'on a tant cherché
Celle qu'on a attendu longtemps

En les aimant en les aimant",Pour la Vie
Florent Pagny,"Où sont partis les hommes qui savent 
Où sont parties ces âmes sages 
Ils sont partis 
Pas trop de bruit 
Jour après jour, nos visages 
Se sont détournés de leur savoir 
Ils sont partis 
On a fermé les yeux 
Ils sont partis 

On a pas su les voir 
Et tout le monde croit savoir 
Aveugles du pouvoir! 

Voix que nous n'entendons plus 
Les hommes qui savent depuis longtemps se sont tus 
Se sont tus 
Tant de chemins parcourus 
Et tant de valeurs perdues

Se sont tus

Florent Pagny,"Bien sûr qu’il n’y a rien à dire 
Les jours se suivent 
Et l’amour ne se ressemble pas 
Ça je l’savais déjà 
Le vide prend sa place 
Et regarde le temps qui passe 

Bien sûr on continue à vivre 
Et l’avenir s’ouvre à nous 
Comme un pays nouveau 
Mais tout nouveau tout beau 
Y paraît qu’c’est bien de r’partir à zéro 

J’sais pas si c’est bien 
J’sais pas si ce sera mieux 
J’sais pas si comme ça 
On sera plus heureux 
J’sais qu’on en avait besoin 
Qu’il fallait pour nous deux 
Qu’il fallait qu’on y arrive 
Même si j’en avais pas envie 
Je sais, c’est la vie qui choisit 

Bien sûr qu’il n’y a rien à dire 
Fais bon voyage 

Et soit fière d’être dans ta peau 
Nous deux, c’est toujours beau 
Oublie les histoires qu’on raconte dans mon dos 

Les souvenirs vont nous accompagner 
Pour habiller ces heures où le goût du passé 
Viendra nous caresser 
Pour ne pas oublier 
Qu’un jour on s’est aimé 

C’est vrai qu’c’était bien 
C’est vrai qu’c’était pas un jeu 
Même la fin on se la fait dans les yeux 
Bonne nuit à demain 
On va vieillir un p’tit peu 
Voir si la vie a bien choisi 
Et si l’amour devient l’ami 
Des mauvais jours 
Là je t’en prie, rappelle-toi 
Je serai toujours là 
Si t’as besoin de quelqu’un qui te connaît bien 
Mais tout va bien se passer 
Fais attention à toi 
Et à bientôt mon p’tit bout

Entre sommeil et petit jour

Pour faire une place à mon amour

Tout piqueté de diamants doux
Quand la rivière défait son lit
Et qu'elle écarte ses genoux

Entre confesse et pieux mensonge
Entre caresse et demi-tour
J'ouvre tes voies que je prolonge
Pour faire une place à mon amour

Et sur la mer vaguement femme
Quand ses courbures se silhouettent
Et qu'elles se gonflent et qu'elles réclament

Entre un baiser et un détour
Entre ma peur et ton sanglot

Su una vecchia terrazza davanti al golfo di Surriento
Un uomo abbraccia una ragazza dopo che aveva pianto
Poi si schiarisce la voce e ricomincia il canto

Te voglio bene assaie ma tanto bene sai
É una catena ormai che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene sai

Vide le luci in mezzo al mare pensò alle notti lá in America
Ma erano solo le lampare e la bianca scia di un'elica
Sentì il dolore nella musica si alzò dal pianoforte
Ma quando vide la luna uscire da un nuvola
Gli sembrò più dolce anche la morte
Guardò negli occhi la ragazza quegli occhi verdi come il mare
Poi all'improvviso uscì una lacrima e lui credette di affogare

Te voglio bene assaie, ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene, sai

Potenza della lirica, dove ogni dramma è un falso
Che con un po' di trucco e con la mimica puoi diventare un altro
Ma due occhi che ti guardano così vicini e veri
Ti fan scordare le parole confondono i pensieri
Così diventa tutto piccolo anche le nottie là in America
Ti volti e vedi la tua vita come là scia di un'elica
Ma si è la vita che finisce ma lui non ci pensò poi tanto
Anzi si sentiva già felice e ricominciò il suo canto

Un gros ceinturon,
Une chemise ouverte

Planquée, dans la Mercédès.

Et la peur qui vous glace, vous tasse et vous ravage

Quand ça arrive
Quand on y est
Alors on sait 
Y a pas un homme qui soit né pour ça
Y a pas un homme qui soit né pour ça
Y a pas un homme, y a pas un homme
Qui soit né pour ça ...

Des cris dans le couloir, le visage dans les mains
On compte l'éternité d'avoir les mêmes lendemains
On se sent seul et sale à bout de tout courage
Comme au fond d'une cale quand on sait le naufrage

Quand ça arrive
Quand on y est 
Alors on sait
Y a pas un homme qui soit né pour ça
Y a pas un homme qui soit né pour ça
Y a pas un homme, y a pas un homme
Qui soit né pour ça ...

La nuit n'est pas levée mais ça ne change rien
La vie est condamnée à n'espérer plus rien
Et ces jours que l'on raye
Ou qu'on décide pour vous
Est-ce qu'on en sort pareil
Ou plus sage ou plus fou
Ou plus sage ou plus fou ...

Y a pas un homme qui soit né pour ça
Y a pas un homme qui soit né pour ça
Y a pas un homme, y a pas un homme
Y a pas un homme
Qui soit né pour ça 
Qui soit né pour ça
Y a pas un homme
Non pas un homme qui soit né pour ça

Y a pas un homme
Y a pas un homme
Qui soit né pour ça ...",Y'a Pas un Homme Qui Soit Né Pour Ça
Florent Pagny,"Elle dit 
Ne parlons pas d'amour 
Restons comme ça au jour le jour 
Elle dit 
Pour elle plus de toujours 
Elle prend plus jamais l'aller sans retour 
Elle dit 
Qu'elle veut rester libre 
Et pouvoir partir quand elle veut 
Qu'elle a perdu l'équilibre 
D'une histoire qui n'se vit qu'à  deux 

Elle dit 
Qu'elle n'a plus peur 
Qu'elle connait trop les plans par cœur 
Que l'homme a commis trop d'erreur 
Qu'il faut remettre les pendules à  l'heure 
Elle dit 

Qu'elle ne veut plus croire les livres 
Qui parlent de l'amour et du feu 

Pourtant elle en a rêvé 
Pourtant elle a tout donné 
En échange elle a eu 
Des larmes des larmes des larmes

Florent Pagny,"C'est pas la plage, pas la Floride 
Pas l'soleil qui m'chatouille les yeux 
Fin du rêve et motel sordide 
C'est la télé qui m'sort du bleu 
Allez, debout 
Ça fait combien d'temps que je suis là  
A rêver d'endroits où j'vais pas 
A me rabâcher que quand t'as plus rien 
Ta fuite au moins, elle t'appartient 
A droite une montagne invincible 
A gauche le précipice m'attire 
Plus l'choix, plus l'choix, devant moi plus qu'ça

Loin de moi, loin d'ici 
De tout c'que j'ai loupé 
Loin pour une autre vie

Loin de moi, loin d'ici

Salut à  tous c'foutu passé 
Bienvenue au futur annoncé 
J'me r'trouve comme un gamin heureux

Florent Pagny,"Rester vrai, c'est compliqué 
Comment se trouver, sans ressembler 

Travestis, dans nos pensées 
Pourquoi toujours écouter l'autre, l'autre parler 

Penser seul, individualité 
Chacun est différent de celui d'à  coté 

Etre soi, mais sans tricher 
Parfois se trouver bien, bien obligé 

Essayer, le mot sincérité 
Du fond de ses défauts jusqu'à  ses qualités 

Etre soi, sans maquiller 
Mais chacun cherche ailleurs, ce qu'il est 

Au-delà  des influences 
C'est une seconde naissance

Chacun s'enferme dans sa coquille 
Les yeux baissés 
Ne plus parler, ne plus parler 
Les garçons ne parlent plus aux filles 
Et ce ne sont même pas des pédés 

Ainsi va le monde

On se désintègre individuel 
On n'avance pas on tourne en rond 
On ne peut plus se provoquer en duel 
Y a plus de témoin dans la maison 

On est tout seul, chacun tout seul 
On refuse la différence 
On est tout seul, tout seul ensemble 
On cultive la différence

Florent Pagny,"Et maintenant que vais-je faire?
De tout ce temps que sera ma vie
De tous ces gens qui m'indiffèrent
Maintenant que tu es partie

Toutes ces nuits, pourquoi, pour qui?
Et ce matin qui revient pour rien
Ce coeur qui bat, pour qui, pourquoi?
Qui bat trop fort, trop fort

Et maintenant que vais-je faire
Vers quel néant glissera ma vie?
Tu m'as laissé la terre entière
Mais la terre sans toi c'est petit

Vous, mes amis, soyez gentils
Vous savez bien que l'on n'y peut rien
Même Paris crève d'ennui
Toutes ses rues me tuent

Et maintenant que vais-je faire?
Je vais en rire pour ne plus pleurer
Je vais brûler des nuits entières
Au matin je te haïrai

Et puis un soir dans mon miroir
Je verrai bien la fin du chemin
Pas une fleur et pas de pleurs
Au moment de l'adieu

Je n'ai vraiment plus rien à faire
Je n'ai vraiment plus rien",Et Maintenant
Florent Pagny,"Ce soir il neige jusqu'en enfer
Il gèle à fendre des cailloux
Y'a du blanc jusque dans la mer
Le ciel touche la terre au bout
Dehors, il fait un froid de chien
Un froid de chagrin de décembre
Et de tous les côtés s'éteint
Le feu qui couve sous la cendre
Et pourtant j'ai chaud
Je sue le sang et l'eau
Je brûle à l'intérieur
Juste à l'endroit du coeur
Et pourtant j'ai chaud
J'ai le feu à la peau
Je brûle pour le pire
À l'endroit du désir…
Partout les rues sont blanches et grises
La lune luit sur les pavés
Les murs ressemblent à des banquises
Qui s'effondrent sans dériver

Le sol est solide et glacé
Les branches cassent comme du verre
Les rivières sont arrêtées
Il fait plus hiver qu'en hiver
Et pourtant j'ai chaud
Je sue le sang et l'eau
Je brûle à l'intérieur
Juste à l'endroit du coeur
Et pourtant j'ai chaud
J'ai le feu à la peau
Et je brûle pour toi
Mais tu ne le vois pas…
Ce soir mêm' le temps est gelé
Il fait pas bon traîner dehors
Les heures durent des années
Les quatre points marquent le nord
Le blizzard cogne à la fenêtre
Y'a du givre sur les étoiles

Pour ne pas déchirer la toile",Le Feu À la Peau
Florent Pagny,"Manière de parler,
Façon de voir
Angle de vue, vue de l'esprit,

L'enfant qui pleure
L'esclave officiel ou le méconnu

Manière de donner,
Façon d'avoir,
Se prêter à des intentions
Mais ne pas rendre ses devoirs
Maigre victoire

Moi je prétends que ce monde
N'a rien de moderne.

Que c'est Dieu qui l'a fait

Qui parle pas le japonais
Qui ne se prend pas pour une déesse
Un peu serrée dans son deux-pièces
Pas un canon de magazine
Dans ses dessous de cellophane
Camper debout dans la benzine
Qui fait semblant d’etre une femme

Un petit bout de rien du tout
Les mains croisées sur ses genoux
Avec des airs de sainte-nitouche
Qui fait Han Han quand je la touche
Pas une gravure aux yeux bidons
Sur un panneau publicitaire
Qui se donne l’air sur son carton
De pouvoir m’envoyer en l’air

A tout peser à bien choisir
J’aime mieux tenir que trop courir
J’aime mieux me dire que d'te mentir
Et je préfère quand vient la nuit
Une femme à moi qu’une fille dans Lui


Un bout de femme mais de bon goût
Qui sent le charme sous ses dessous
Et puis dessus sur sa boutique
Les parfums chics de Prisunic
Pas une diva amidonnée
Qui se trémousse à la télé
Avec ses seins inanimés
Qui voudrait bien me faire rever

A tout peser à bien choisir
J’aime mieux tenir que trop courir
J’aime mieux me dire que d'te mentir
Et je préfère quand vient la nuit
Une femme à moi qu’une fille dans Lui

Un bout de femme et son caddy
Dans les rayons de chez Tati

The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

But baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do ya
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

People. people, people

I only ask of God
He won't let me be indifferent to the injustice
That they do not slap my other cheek
After a claw has scratched my whole body

I only ask of God
He won't let me be indifferent to the wars
It is a big monster which treads hard
On the poor innocence of people
It is a big monster which treads hard

Florent Pagny,"Sciogli i capelli 
spoglia il tuo cuore 
restiamo nudi qui
senza parole

Non ti ho amato
mai abbastanza 
da lasciare tutto
quando me ne andai 
la distanza fu 
una malattia 

Finchè pace non avrò
finchè luce troverò
da te mi rifugerò
una amante io 
perso nell'oblio

E nasce il giorno
tra le lenzuola
come ogni volta 
io fuggo ancora

Dal profumo tuo
che mi segue 
in ogni respiro
quando tornerò 
dentro casa mia 
e ti scorderò

Finchè pace non avrò
finchè luce troverò
da te mi rifugerò

Florent Pagny,"Tears falling from the sky
And how can we not know the reason why?
It took us all two thousand years of work and strife
Bringing the day we made God cry.

They taught us all from birth
There’s only one who rules upon this earth.
We know his name! We even claim we know his face.
Blue eyes or black.......... his sorrow’s our disgrace.

CHORUS:
So we lay our roads and slay the trees.
To possess more than our enemies.
And our means can justify the end. We’ll
Trample on a friend. So disrespectfully. 
And with all this anger in our hearts
We rebel and swear God plays a part.
So we kill and pray to make amends. The 
Story never ends and flags will burn again.

Tears falling from the sky.
Under the dust the city ceased to shine
And all the children search within their mother’s eyes.........
“ How could it be that we have made God cry?”

CHORUS:
So we lay our roads and slay the trees.
To possess more than our enemies.
And our means can justify the end. We’ll
Trample on a friend. So disrespectfully.
And we send our hatred from above
In the name of one who taught to love.
We proclaim we’re worthy of this place. The
Chosen human race could
Never justify.................the day we made God cry.",The Day We Made God Cry

Que je brûle mes derniers feux

Pour mieux parler de virilité

Comme des arbres de Noël

Etre une heure, une heure quelquefois 
Etre une heure, rien qu'une heure durant

Du whisky de Clermont-Ferrand

Que j'aie une banque à chaque doigt 
Et un doigt dans chaque pays 
Que chaque pays soit à moi

Celui qui est dans l'annuaire 
Entre Dieulefit et Dieu vous garde

Même si toujours trop bonne pomme 
Je me crève le coeur et le pur esprit 
A vouloir consoler les hommes 
Je sais quand même que chaque nuit 
J'entendrai dans mon 
Paradis Les anges, les Saints et Lucifer

El amor prefiero hacértelo de día, me gustan tus ojos y tu timidez

Porque yo no quiero dejar de creer, no tengo mucho que perder

Cuando era grande como un pez 
Y todo parecía mal 
La vida debía pasar
Cuando no sabía qué hacer 

Bajo campanas de un reló 
Bajo las faldas de mamá 
Me aseguraban sin dudar 
Que luego seria mejor 

A veces piensan que no voy
Por donde deberia andar
Pero no me gusta olvidar

Y cuando miro alrededor
Y todo me parece igual
Me gustaria reclamar
Ahora que puedo preguntar
A los que saben mucho mas
A los que deben responder

Dónde está la poesia
Dónde están los que podian
Donde van las ilusiones
Dónde están las decisiones
Dónde están las alegrias
Que le hace falta a la vida
Dónde esta lo que buscaba
Cuando no sabía de nada

Quizás parece que viví 
Mejor de lo que podía ser
Si bien recuerdo lo que vi
Cuando no sabia que hacer

Pero no pienso que este bien
Dejar las cosas como están
Porque alguien vendrá a preguntar
Y cuando miro alrededor
Y todo me parece igual
Ahora yo quiero reclamar
Ahora que puedo preguntar
A los que saben la verdad
A los que deben responder

Dónde está la poesia
Dónde están los que podian
Donde van las ilusiones
Dónde están las decisiones
Dónde están las alegrias
Que le hace falta a la vida
Dónde  esta lo que buscaba
Cuando no sabia de nada

Dónde están los motivos
Y dónde está lo que digo

Dónde está la poesia
Dónde están los que podian
Donde van las ilusiones
Dónde están las decisiones
Dónde están las alegrias
Que le hace falta a la vida
Dónde esta lo que buscaba

Florent Pagny,"Donde va la vida, la vida de adentro
La que va conmigo, la que esta en mi sueno
La vida que fluye de la que me invento
La vida que esconde tantos sentimientos

Donde va la vida, la que hacemos juntos
La de las miradas, la de las sonrisas, la de los segundos
La vida más suave, que controla todo
Mi poeta vida al mirar tus ojos

Donde va la vida, la que deja tiempo
La de los momentos que saben a vida, la que pasa lento
La vida con nombre, la vida sin miedo
La inocente vida de los que podemos

Pasa un ave sombre el mar
Pasa el rio en su caudal
Pasa el viento sin hablar y yo 
Antes que vuelva a pasar, esta vida, se te va
Se te va la vida, la vida se va

Donde va la vida, la vida que impone
La vida castigo por estar debajo de las decisiones
La pequeña vida, la que nadie mira
La que se confunde, la que no termina

Donde va la vida, la vida que muere 
Antes que la vida de la soluciones, la vida que hiere
La vida sin vida, que pasa de largo
La vida escondida detrás de un milagro

Donde está la vida, la que nos gastamos
La que merecemos, la que nos debemos, la que nos confiaron
La vida que vuelve sin dejarnos vida
La vida del otro, la vida que es vida

Pasa un ave sobre el mar
Pasa el rio en su caudal
Pasa el viento sin hablar y yo
Antes de que vuelva, la vida se va, la vida se va
Se te va la vida, la vida se va

Donde va la vida, la vida se va

Donde va la vida, la vida se va

Florent Pagny,"Pensar, tener, querer, andar 
Abriendo en cada puerta una verdad 
Yo soy quien va dejando atrás 
Tú entregas cada noche el alma 
¿Cómo llegar y no perder? 
Se enreda entre la suerte cada despertar 
Cristal de miel, agua de mar 
¡Despierta! El día llega y se nos va

Encore tes yeux, encore ton souffle
Encore ta main
Encore nous deux, encore heureux
Encore demain
Encore je t'aime, encore je suis
Encore c'est toi
Et puis encore, encore s'enfuir
Jusqu'à demain

Tocar la voz, borrar la piel 
Correr, volar, me salva 
Mirar tus manos tocando el mar 
Saber que sólo soy un árbol en la piedra 
Y tú te irás aún sin querer 
En un segundo hay tanto que te sobra 
Perdona mi viejo amor, mi carrusel 
Se está nublando el cielo, va a llover

Encore tes yeux, encore ton souffle
Encore ta main
Encore nous deux, encore heureux
Encore demain
Encore je t'aime, encore je suis
Encore c'est toi
Et puis encore, on va s'enfuir
Encore demain",Encore
Florent Pagny,"De papel o de ceniza
Como un cuento del abuelo 
Descubrí bajo el sombrero
Una tarde su sonrisa
A nadie se parecía
Al menos en la mirada
Jovencita de mil ganas 
Y otras miles prohibidas 
Y nos fuimos caminando entre risas y alborotos 
Y a su lado fui sonando entre sorpresas y rotos 

Habana, que espera 
Sentada en el balcón a que suba la marea
Habana tranquila 
Bañándose en el mar la luna siempre te mira 
Y yo

Me dijeron tantas cosas
De buenos y de villanos 
Pero al hablarte con las manos 
Se te enredan las razones 
Y luego la mente flota
Dicen que tiene un amante 
Pero prefiere estar sola
Tiene una luz que enamora 
Y un dolor en el semblante 
Y volvimos caminando 
Bien borrachos de alegría 
Pero no se todavía si ya fue
O está pasando

Habana se enciende
Jugando a enamorar
Jugando a ser diferente 
Habana desnuda
Pasiones de un lugar, donde la vida se fuma

Si la vas a enamorar, siente 
Si la quieres olvidar, no te enamores
Y si llegas a besar 
Terminas aprendiendo a respetar su suerte 

Habana cansada 
De volver a empezar 
Y de que no pase nada. 
Habana de noche, 
La magia de rodar 
Donde todos te conocen
 
Habana perdida
De música y de mar 
Pasiones y mentiras 
Habana se enciende
Jugando a enamorar
Jugando a ser diferente

Habana desnuda 
Pasiones de un lugar 
Donde la vida se fuma, se fuma
Donde la vida se fuma 
Habana

Habana desnuda 
Pasiones de un lugar 
Donde la vida se fuma

Florent Pagny,"Otra vez tus ojos me dicen te amo y otra vez un beso 
Y otra vez las manos que quedan apretadas 
Decidiendo los sueños que llegaran mañana 
Otra vez se me olvida la mitad de la vida 
Y el silencio se instala y los miedos se pierden 
Y otra vez la ventana se ha quedado abierta 
Y otra vez yo contigo hasta que amanezca 

Otra vez los mismos cuentos largos 
Y otra vez nada empieza y otra vez yo me tardo 
Y me busco entre gritos que casi no me miran 
Y me pierdo entre mitos que deciden mi vida 
Y otra vez lo que acaba y otra vez la prisa 
Y otra vez el domingo encontró mi sonrisa 
Y yo me quedo sentado mirándote en la calma 
Que suerte de tenerte
Pa’ no perder la calma 
Pa’ no perder la calma

Agua salada 
Recorriendo los portales 
Agua salada que se mezcla con la brisa 
Se me empapa la camisa y crujen los ventanales 
Voy jugando a quien no sabe y me contagia tu risa 
Pa’ no perder la calma

Otra vez me descubro aturdido persiguiendo una idea 
Y otra vez la marea que cambia de sentido 
Y otra vez los que imponen y los que no se disculpan 
Y otra vez una culpa, un silencio y un miedo 
Y otra vez yo no puedo y otra vez no me toca 
Y otra vez me descubro debajo de mi ropa 
Aceptando idioteces y sueños que no quiero 
Y otra vez yo me digo al ver a mi fantasma 
Que suerte de tenerte
Pa’ no perder la calma 
Pa’ no perder la calma 

Agua salada, entre mis ojos claros 
Agua salada, en el beso que me has dado 
Tú te enredas con mis manos y yo me pierdo contigo 
Qué bueno que estás conmigo y suspirar a tu lado 

Pero otra vez tu te escondes y otra vez tú me niegas 
Y el corazón se me rompe 
Y otra vez el demonio 
Y otra vez esa gente 
Y otra vez tengo miedo, miedo de perderte 
Hasta otra vez sentir que sigues siendo mía 
Y perderme de nuevo entre tu fantasía 
Como hay que darle al alma, con tal de no perderse 
Pa’ no perder la calma 
Pa’ no perder la calma
Pa’ no perder la calma

Florent Pagny,"Finalmente hoy, algo se acaba y algo empieza
Pienso que en verdad, tampoco lo hemos hecho mal
Tenia que llegar, porque el camino siempre da la vuelta
Finalmente hoy, ya nos volvemos a encontrar

Vamos a escapar, sin rumbo sin motivo
Quiero caminar, tomar el aire frió

Tanto tiempo que se va, en un solo giro
Volvemos a empezar, de nuevo el camino
Pero sobra paz, y me falta el ruido
Una musica de mas, cambiando de lugar
Sin ningún sentido

Finalmente aqui, ahora nos sobra el silencio
Quitare el reloj no necesito mas el tiempo
Vamos a escapar sin rumbo, sin sentido
Tengo que salir, tomar el aire frió

Todo el tiempo que se va en un solo instante
Volvemos a empezar sin saber como era antes
Si me falta el dolor, y me falta el ruido
Una musica que va cambiando de lugar
Sin ningún sentido

Tanto tiempo que se va
Al pasar la puerta
Y ya nunca volvera
Solo se recuerda
Tengo que esperar y ver, pero falta el ruido
Y la musica se ira, y el dolor se acabara
Y el silencio llegara
Sin motivos",Falta El Ruido
Florent Pagny,"Se despertó con los ojos apretados a la cara, y se encontró
Se levantó con lo poco de verdad que le quedaba, y decidió

Esto no puede seguir, me estoy cortando las alas
Esto no puede seguir, ni siquiera hasta mañana, ni siquiera hasta mañana

Buscaré los sueños que perdí
Volveré porque no encuentro nada, todo se acaba
Viviré porque es mejor así
Porque a mí me da la gana, porque a mí me da la gana

Un día encontró que hay montones de colores que no faltan y quiso ver
Le pareció haber inventado el mundo que faltaba y decidió

Esto tiene que seguir, nada cortara mis ganas
Quiero andar donde no sé, quiero ir donde me llaman
Ya veré qué hago mañana

Y dejo los sueños por ahí
Se escondió de su propia mirada, que lo de hallaba
Y se fue tan lejos que no vio como el tiempo se acabada, todo el tiempo que pasaba

Buscares los sueños que perdí
Volveré porque no encuentro nada, todo se acaba
Viviré porque es mejor vivir

Porque a mí me da la gana
Porque a mí me da la gana",Viviré
Florent Pagny,"Un letrero la pared
Y una calle sin final 
Un secreto en la distancia 
La sombra de lo que fue 
Una cabaña detrás
Solo sus manos me alcanzan 

Y me quedé sin saber 
Y me quedé sin hablar 
Pero se me que fui feliz 

Recostado a la pared 
Sin más nada que ofrecer 
Nos contamos esperanzas 
Creo que el amanecer 
Sin palabras sin café 
Los mentimos en la cama

Y me sentí respirar 
Recostada junto a mi 
Lo demás vendrá mañana 

Porque 
Hay que volar otra vez

Confiar en los sueños 
Hay que cambiarse la piel 
Reír sin parar
Meterse en el centro

Volver a cantar 
Sin prisa y sin miedo 
Hay que querer ser feliz 
Ganar o perder es parte del juego 
Parte de mi 

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Veo la gente pasar
Me da gusto comprender 
Que nadie vivido todo 
Siempre busca la ilusión 
Que te vuelve a despertar 
Y que te llene de ganas 
Luego sigue por ahí 
Intentando ser feliz

Me pierdo un poco en el juego 
De quererte enamorar 
Trato de hacer lo que puedo 
Tu sonríes desde lejos 
Y no se disimular 

En intentar no soy bueno 
Y a veces me desespero 
Siempre me gusta ganar 
Tu siempre sales delante 
Con tu mirada elegante 
Yo tan poco natural 

Ay mira que me gusta todos 
Los colores claros, tu melancolía 
Ay mira que nada me importa 
Más que tus secretos, tu fantasía 
Qué bueno estar a tu lado, mi amor 
Y ver pasar la vida 
Luego cantarte tu bolero mi amor
Hasta que llegue el día 

Yo con mi voz de bolero 
Siempre algo lo que más quiero 
Tan poco me va mal
Me gusta ver la mañana 
Quedarme un rato en la cama 
Y sentirte respirar 

Aunque el día no sea bueno 
Salgo a buscarte y te espero 
Para poderme escapar 
Entre tu boca y tu pelo 
Con mis ganas y sin miedo 
Nadie nos puede parar

Ay mira que me gustan todas 
Tus verdades claras 
Y tu fantasía 
Ay mira que nada me importa 
Más que tu mirada 
Y tu poesía 
Qué bueno estar a tu lado, mi amor 
Y ver pasar la vida 
Luego cantate un bolero mi amor,

Someone that turns your heart around
And next thing you know you're closing down the town
Wake up and it's still with you
Even though you left her way across town
Wondering to yourself, ""Hey, what've I found?""

When you get caught between the Moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the Moon and New York City
The best that you can do,
The best that you can do is fall in love

Arthur he does as he pleases
All of his life, he's mastered choice
Deep in his heart, he's just, he's just a boy
Living his life one day at a time
And showing himself a really good time
Laughing about the way they want him to be

When you get caught between the Moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the Moon and New York City
The best that you can do,

y yo te voy a esperar
y no me voy a pintar
yo se que te gusto mucho
cuando me ves natural

y llegare tan puntual,
no quiero perder mas tiempo
Cada segundo que tardas
es un beso que te resto

Me pondre el vestido azul
que se que te gusta mas
Dejare mi pelo suelto
para que baile en el viento

y en nuestra esquina de siempre
el aire se ha perfumado
Porque en todas las ventanas
el amor se esta asomando

Estribillo:
Pero no vino nunca, no llego
y mi vestido azul se me arrugo
y esta esquina, no es mi esquina
y este amor, ya no es mi amor

Pero no vino nunca, no llego
y yo jamas sabre lo que paso
Me fui llorando despacio
me fui dejando el corazon

y me robaste la esquina,
y me quede tan perdida
A donde vuelan mis sueños?
a un callejon sin salida

y me quite mi vestido,
que tanto te gustaba
Total me siento desnuda,
total ya no tengo nada

Pero no vino nunca, no llego
y mi vestido azul se me arrugo
y esta esquina, no es mi esquina
y este amor, ya no es mi amor

Floricienta,"Cuantas promesas se van con el tiempo
Hoy yo me ahogo en un mar de recuerdos
Yo construía un castillo de sueños
Que pronto se derrumbo
Cuando te vi en aquel bosque encantado
Un duende dijo que tu eras mi príncipe azul
Como si fuera por arte de magia
Llenaste mis días de luz
Pero todo acabó
Ya nada quedó entre los dos
Porque como en un cuento un enorme dragón
Nos robo el corazón
Por favor donde estás
Tu eres mi otra mitad
Siempre estaré esperando
Y yo sé que un día regresaras

Algún día regresaras
Y nuestra historia se pierde a lo lejos
No encontrare tu mirada en secreto
Y dibujando mi olvido en silencio
Con el color de un adiós
Yo me invente todo un cuento de hadas
Pero al final nos ganó esa bruja tan cruel
Lo que soñamos quedó en el olvido
Y todo tu amor se perdió
Pero todo acabó
Ya nada quedó entre los dos
Porque como en un cuento
Un enorme dragón
Nos robo el corazón
Por favor donde estás
Tu eres mi otra mitad

Siempre estaré esperando

Que vendría él a buscarla

Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
It’d look a hell lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

My windows down my seat back my music up when we ride
Her legs up on my dashboard, and that’s just the way I like
Hey country girl, this country boy like er’thing about ya
Don’t change a thing, no way, you stay the same I gotcha
Life’s all that, all that, head to toe you all that
Tell ol’ boy he call back, send a text say “fall back” (‘Cause)
I can see you got a thing for the fast life
So come on shorty let me show you what the fast’s like
Whippin’ cross the border Florida into Georgia
‘Cause baby you a song and you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin’ stop signs through the middle
Every hood er’ry town with you
And this drop top Chevy painted real slick
It’ll look a hell of a lot better when you up in it (you up in it)
‘Cause baby you a song and you make me wanna roll my, roll my, roll my (roll my) oh

Well baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin’ stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
It’d look a hell lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

Jet trails cutting cross the sky

Searching for a song to drink beer to
And trying to find a place to disappear to

I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch the sundown fade
Do what I do and life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for the shooting star and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield looking back looks just like me
But there's a crack in the reflection
This is just a moonlight soaked, rain and smoke
Right hand on a cold one confession

Embers in the ashtray glow like memories that won't let go
I'm out here trying to get untangled
In the darkness on the edge of town
A little lost, a little found
Waiting on a call from an angel

Tangled up in a satin sheet
And get a little loud when we've had to much to drink
And learn to love from a church pew
Laugh about all the times we counted pennies
Buy some land with a good view
To start a family
Baby grow old with me

It's gonna take a little time we'll have to work at it everyday
We're gonna lose a lot of sleep and learn to eat out of a microwave
You know we'll probably never have it all
But that's part of building up the walls strong enough to stand up through the rain

We'll make some love on your favorite beach
And at the house that we found in the city limits 
Talk our babies through the bad dreams
When they get a little older we'll tell them not to drink 
Book a church when she finds a groom
Laugh about all the times they'll count the pennies
Give them land with a good view
To start a family

Falling easy prey to your lust, giving treachery a try.

You'll soon wish you could die...it can be arranged...

When it does, you'll know and feel the wickedness of delusion,
And the pain selfish pleasures conceal.

Whom we're taught to fear from day number one.
The beguiling serpent, king of the underworld,
Betrayer and mocker of heaven's chosen one.

Ultimate deceiver; longing to take you in.
He promises earthly glory, if you play his game;
""I won't let the firebombs hurt you, just
Number your head and take my name.""

Belial begins his scheming, treacherous plan,
Turns brother on brother, toys with the leaders of man.
He creates before them illusions of broken truce,
A wicked plot of deception, that commanders cannot refuse.

There in the midst stands the deceiver
Bearing a brooding smile.
Surrounded by his marked believers,
The masses of unscarred.

Evil's reign, called by the prophets,
Under a darkened sky,
Ghastly sins everywhere, unmarked survivors
Sacrificed as demons dance.
Suddenly, the hordes are silenced,
By the rumbling planed, metalbeast soon to appear,
To challenge the enemy, to deal his doom,
To write the devil's dirge...Doomsday!

The scorched ground opens, the beast of metal appears,
Satan and his army show no sign of fear.
Across desert plains, through city streets,
In the hills evil meets defeat.
Covens one by on fall by metal's hand,
As the dark forces weaken.
The monster rages through the battles,
To confront the master of sin.

As the night falls, the beasts, they meet
And the existing numbered line along the street.
The air is charged with power metal,
Flotzilla's eyes glow as he feeds.
The clash begins, a fight 'til death,
Such power never seen before.
Thrashing jaws, slashing claws,
Dealing the darkside's fate;
The deceiver's doom this day...DOOMSDAY!

Her cold blood boils from the heat

With such a grip I barely got out!

Dream of harsh reality, a vision of your life you see.
House of fire; the price you pay for a broken family,
The anger that burns inside, you still can't set it free.
Struggle for your sanity, betrayed and left alone,
No one to reach out to, for you to call your own.
You want to end this life of hell, to free your heart of stone,
In self-digrace, the human race, the streets become your home.

Do you think that you're to blame for the life they chose to lead.
The cards were dealt for them to play in a game of life and death,
They lost their lives, misguided fortune, there's nothing for you now.

Molded from the grinding stone, you live your life in vain.
Blackened scarfs that remain alive, you cover with your guise,
Time to live, time to die, which will you decide?

House of fire, a price well paid, a life now yours to lead,
You released the pain from inside, before it drained your life.
You came to terms, you weren't to blame for their decisions now are yours,
The mask is gone, no more to hide, the face of fate you kept inside.
Against the odds you stayed alive, to rebuild this fatal mess,
The life in vain that sucked you in is fading with the past.
You found a home, security, the strength that you desired,
To live your life long prophecy, your chance to kill the fire.

Errors kept under lock and key

Will there be no place to hide when the storm comes down
To tear off my hide, defenseless, rich or poor

Water splashes on my skin it makes me dry

There was nothing left to see

Of something from my past

How soon will it end today
Friends are friends close by
How soon they're gone away

As he stops to wheeze and cough
I seize the fruit
And steal his day away

But it's constant help from the people who know
Make it tougher than it has to be
Every single day I try to get things done
I'm either stopped by the cold or burnt by the sun
There is no easy way to speak your mind
And even harder to get them to hear

I ain't got
I ain't got nothing to say

Every little piece of fantasy
Keeps me right where they want me to be
There's a code that they're all searching by
A map of places I might hide
It's dark with a couple of marker lights
All of my hunters are afraid of heights
There's a well known fact that they don't know
They're chasing a man not on the go I ain't got
I ain't got nothing to say

My neck gets stiff from staring up at the world
I'd show you all my self esteem
But I lost it somewhere down the road

Is a foot shorter than the space next to me
I can't see the action due to the crowd
There is never a horizon in my view

And I never seem to get all the way to shore

Flow Master Hip Hop,"A long long time ago
I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie

Singin' this'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

And I'm lonesome
I got the lovesick blues

Well I'm in love I'm in love with a beautiful gal
That's what's the matter with me
Well I'm in love I'm in love with a beautiful gal
But she don't care about me

Lord I tried and tried, to keep her satisfied
But she just wouldn't stay
So now that she is leavin'
This is all I can say

I got a feelin' called the blues, oh Lord
Since my baby said goodbye
Lord I don't know what I'll do
All I do is sit and sigh, oh Lord

That last long day she said goodbye
Well Lord I thought I would cry
She'll do me, she'll do you
She's got that kind of lovin'

Lord I love to hear her when she calls me sweet daaddy
Such a beautiful dream
I hate to think it all over
I've lost my heart it seems

I've grown so used to you somehow
Lord I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
And I'm lonesome
I got the lovesick blues",Lovesick Blues
Floyd Cramer,"Once I was alone
So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part

Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.

Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have

Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
I guess I never told you
That I am so happy that you're mine

Give me, give me one more chance

One for every time you've broke my heart,
And as the door of love between us closes,

I begged you to be different but you've always been untrue,
I'm tired of forgiving and there is nothing left to do,
So I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses,
One for every time you broke my heart.

You've made our lovers lane a road of sorrow,
'Til at last we had to say goodbye,
You're leaving me to face each new tomorrow,
With a heart that you taught how to cry.

I know that I should hate you after all you've put me through,

There goes the one of my dreams,
There goes my only possession,
There goes my everything

I worry and wonder.
Your lips may be near,
but where is your heart?

It's always like this,
I worry and wonder.
You're close to me here,
but where is your heart?

It's a sad thing to realize 
that you've a heart that never melts.
When we kiss, do you close your eyes,
pretending that I'm someone else?

You must break the spell,
this cloud that I'm under.
So please won't you tell, darling,
where is your heart?

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,

And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Floyd Red Crow Westerman,"A young cowboy named Billy Joe grew restless on the farm
A boy filled with wonderlust who really meant no harm
He changed his clothes and shined his boots
And combed his dark hair down
And his mother cried as he walked out

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He laughed and kissed his mom
And said your Billy Joe's a man
I can shoot as quick and straight as anybody can
But I wouldn't shoot without a cause
I'd gun nobody down
But she cried again as he rode away

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He sang a song as on he rode
His guns hung at his hips
He rode into a cattle town
A smile upon his lips
He stopped and walked into a bar
And laid his money down
But his mother's words echoed again

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hand
And tried to tell himself he had at last he had become a man
A dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down
And he heard again his mothers words

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

Filled with rage then
Billy Joe reached for his gun to draw
But the stranger drew his gun and fired
Before he even saw
As Billy Joe fell to the floor
The crowd all gathered 'round
And wondered at his final words

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town",Don't Take Your Guns to Town
Floyd Red Crow Westerman,"In a little cabaret
In a south Texas boarder town
Sat a boy and his guitar
And the people came from all around
And all the girls
From there to Austin
Were slippin' away from home
And puttin' jewelry in hock to take the trip
To go and listen
To the little dark-haired boy who played the
Tennessee flat top box
And he would play

Well he couldn't ride or wrangle
And he never cared to make it dime
But give him his guitar
And he'd be happy all the time
And all the girls
From nine to ninety
Were snappin' fingers
Tappin' toes 
And beggin' him don't stop 
And hypnotized
And fascinated
By the little dark-haired boy who played the
Tennessee flat top box
And he would play

Then one day he was gone
And no one ever saw him 'round
He vanished like the breeze
They forgot him in the little town
But all the girls
Still dreamed about him
And hung around
The caberet until the doors were locked
And then one day
On the hit parade
Was a little dark-haired boy who played the
Tennessee flat top box 
And he would play",Tennessee Flat Box Top
Floyd Tillman,"My sweetheart is gone and I'm so lonely
He said that he and I were through

Fluent,"Disguising you never seen me
But for the wrath of my lyrical chi devastating capabilities
Strike mercilessly
Indoctrinated mind under total control
Acidic stranglehold to erode and
Destroy opposing foes
Thinking freeflows
Choreograph like ballets
Capable of disguising true purpose needs and intent
So swift
One thought could crumple the sham defenses
The degree of the stringent rhyme-fu master intense is
Flowing ideals of immense fortified understanding
Expressly demanding lyrical wildfire fanning
Senses so acute distinguished through objects and portals
Simpletons who are untrained we call identical and normal
Seen bandwidth through online zenith mandates 
Hand turning fate will take your queen
Deliver checkmate
This mission
Most other mortals would just fuckin' fear but I accept the challenge
I fuckin' zealously adhere

[Hook, X1]
Pray upon your gods to bring you fertile ground and plentiful bounty
Just so you could hold a feast for him
While your stomach is still growling
Still howling at the moon
For release from the streets to which your doomed

Inclined destiny
Master design will unfold in due time
In the blueprints of my mind
Behind the blockade I'm confined

I have nothing
Am nothing
Need nothing
Born into a world of suffering
And my veins burst so I bleed nothing
Breathe nothing
Find love of nothing
Plant a seed a nothing
Breed nothings
Whose nothing hearts will beat nothing
Through artificial mediums false thoughts are conceived within
Disease begins to fester and call the antidote heathens
Through prosthetic inquisitions the world is enveloped in
A gripping sin a damned kin
We just call it passing trends
True power comes from inside and is expressed through instincts
Some have found the missing piece
But others call it resisting
Zygotes of polyurethane in a cervix copper lining
The body's seeming wiring controlled by a cyber ring
Now we raise children in a vessel-like incubator
What happens when someone trips the cable or overloads the generator?

Fluent,"Check me out right here yo

Stone carved sonnets
Set in Tibet written in onyx marks the coming of a comet
Which rides a Fluent prophet
To stop shit that fake shit I'm a take shit back
Progressive movements in tune with a makeshift match

Raisin' an army
Fighting over radio stations which one day might play some conscious emancipation
For the duration of this ego glorified monopolized disguised disgrace in front of ya face
Lackin' pride
They hidin' behind jewels and riches
I know the malignant foolish festering played out ungifted
Especially when capitalists are evading taxes
While we're breaking our backs and getting burnt faster than matchsticks

This is for my true heads dancing with the dead
For whatever reason falling short of success
Gotta test the bounds of excess before you see what's next
don't ponder to the extent
You will know when you're not vexed

Some can't handle so they get dropped quick
Off labels only props they get is in Saturday Night Live skits
Then off buildings for tryin to diss me this and that
Kidnapped they kids like I was starrin' in fuckin Parent Trap

Lastly off the map
Dig a hole deep enough
Floating in the middle of the earth with all the others who were wack
Sorry dog you kissed ass to get to the top
But when I signed on your album flopped and you got laid off

[Hook, 2X]
Who are you to try and be true
The fact is you define what wack is
I'm long overdue for appearances
This lyricist is redefining game
Every vein and membrane is cold in steel that you can't stain

Next verse
Deadly like the first
Like a hearse carrying a mourns in the fucking hurts
The loss the heartache the high priced funeral
The casket or ashes in an urn whatever's suitable

Am I offensive or do I just say what you don't like?
Say what you don't want to hear magnified through a mic
Inter-correctional 23 hour lockdowns
Release the fuckin' hounds they found in empty cell pound

Get free
Drown the sorrows with a high proof bottle
I'm sitting writing in the grotto with no positive role models
All criminal and psychopathic individuals gather for the residual of their municipal

Supposedly indivisible but divided by the livest survivors
From tribes who recruit hardcore connivers

The number one don gotta' make it hotter than a sauna
in a summer in Nevada wearin' four layers of datta

Another lyrical miracle making your fearful
Frenzied by this imperial
Givin' you an earful

I crush hype with my grip like a vice
My salivas' kerosene 
My words are the light
So I ignite mics

And when the times right and the beats sick
I create such appetising rhymes
You wish that you could eat it

The collegiate quadriplegic with theories and postulates
Wordly Theory couldn't disprove or not believe in

[Hook]

Re-circulated and re-prioritized
I'm the sorta guy that you distributors immortalize
So fuckin' fortified I can't be moved 
Glorified to the extent I never get booed or loose

Unlocked never keep the fuckin' safety on
Gnawed through my muzzle
Now I'm known from here to the great beyond

Attack the central nervous and immune systems
You got acute symptoms of another fuckin' stool pigeon

Ya'll watchin' TV I'm readin' Neitzche
Bein' examined in the lab as a new species
Ruthless flow till my mouth is fuckin' toothless
If I had toothpicks in my gums or vomiting mucas

Cunning and well versed but overlooked and even worse
I'm cursed by the demonic church makin' me work

Dynamic planned and standin' for the follow up
Already heated because I already swallowed the bottle up

My mind is journeyin' through come-up plots
A have not in the late night on a mad block poppin' off pad locks

I'm steppin' on toes like they was wearin' sandles
The entire fuckin' Florida panhandle can't handle

Go ahead I insist
I got the fiscal year fixed
My fist pierces like poison dipped arrow tips
These logistics are scientific magnificent
Genetically enhanced and engineered
Guaranteed infinite

Flume,"My rhymes so unspeakable
My dreams so unreachable
Give it a purpose, cause life itself isn't meaningful
Now that's the truth, I'm speaking for the youth
That's aiming for the top but falling from the roof
Here we, here we go again, with my paper and my pen
Summer 2012 its the year of the end, or is it?
Exquisite lyrics, you hear it or do you fear it
Jammin' in my car, smelling like teen spirit
I see a star falling form the sky, should I catch it
I wanna die in my car, should I wreck it

This drug makes you hooked once, should I test it
Yes no maybe so, now its time for me to grow
Outside of my flow, Do I ever get to know
what my real passion is, why am I so imaginative
Adverb, pronoun, noun, verb, adjective
Mouth running, talking shit, cool it with the laxatives
But its time, to recognize Armageddon's signs
Start lootin' stores, kill whoever, I don't mind
If you see me, don't bro me if you don't know me
That goes to you, you, you and all my homeys

Cause nobody knows me, and nobody told me
How to write poetry, this fucking world owes me
Everything I've ever wanted, fuck you and fuck your life
Fuck you everyday, fuck you every night
Look at all the fucks I give I should start a charity
Bitches thinking they in love, bitches starting to scare me
Only love is family, and my lost dog charlie
If you've seen a white English bull dog call me
All I want out of this world is a changed world
All I want is a metaphysical dream girl

To smoke DMT and weed starting at the universe
Trying to figure out how, nothingness is giving birth
To all of reality, if space had gravity
Would we fall forever or will hit the ground
I wanna step outside the Universe and see whats all around
Cause I don't believe in anything, not even myself
Only way to wake up from the dream is through death
But I keep my sanity, or whatevers left
Cause I gotta keep striving, opposite of thriving
Gotta stay alive and, always keep trying",Sleepless

Flux of Pink Indians,"The wind blows, the baby cries
People die, their deaths are untold
Land is desolate, nothing here grows
People living, for the sight of a food bowl
Trapped in an existence, it's hard to think
Such people really exist, hard to believe
Their plight is accepted
When money so wasted could be redirected
They're not some race that don't feel pain
Stravation is something you don't become immune to",Song for Them
Flux of Pink Indians,"Can ye smell the neu smell, tumbling through the air?
Aye, I can lad
It's coming from over there

Well why not bury it there?",Neu Smell
Flux of Pink Indians,"Man created greed
A choice of who to feed
A choice to live or die
A choice to smile or cry
A love to give to all
To make, to beg or crawl
A life there and the plans
A pass to say what was
Inventions like the bomb
A device to stop what's wrong
A chance to create a life
Similar to the last
Road to follow straight
Animal to fill the plate
Death, that is so sad
Rituals that are not mad
Like eating what is dead
I thought that made man sad
Obviously not the same
Breed animals to be tame
So man can show the fists
Cause only man exists
Lion eats a man
Man invades its land
Man prods it with a gun
Always proving man has won
Oh, lion eats all but shoes
Big business in the news
Shocks, horrors, families eating
Stuffing all the bleeding meat in

""What a savage, it ate a man""
""I won't feed the lions in the zoo again""

Wishing you'd be, be there to blow my mind. 
In the middle of silly cotton laced cartwheels I noticed you were jealous and gay.

So I lay. 
Curled up in your shadow. 
As you play your baby grand piano. 
I hear you sing, things look pretty good which means we've stumbled through another day.

[Chorus]
How can we fight when theres nothing left to say to you? 
I might seem lacking int the way I try to say to you
I like the way you like the way I look at you in shadowed rooms, 
With blanket smiles that brush against your mind. 

You broke my watch. Yet it's a beautiful day to fall in love coddle the afterthoughts. 
Of why things won't mend I can't comprehend what happened on our strawberry hill.

Asleep againâ?¦ this tim I'm truly alone. 
And so I dream, dream I was flying again. I saw a plane. 
An airplane in the sky, with me.

Jump out of bed. And blaze my way to the kitchen. 
Try to call but the dial tone is missing. 
So I cry in my coffee and writhe on the floor, this is no way to start a brand new day.

Believe it not

But we pretended that we still lived.
With no regrets we never bled and we took everything life could give

Something you'll never find is a vision of light
With the voice of the dead, I'm screaming

Not once in life have I been real but I never felt this close before
I've been looking in your window I've been dressing in your clothes
I've been walking dead, watching you, long enough to know I can't go on.

Had a dream that fire fell from an opening in the sky
Someone warned me of this hell,
And I spit in his naive eye
And left him crying for my soul he said would die

With the voice of the dead I'm screaming

I don't know who I am anymore

FM Static,"Crazy Mary's a slow girl who looks up to no one
Would do anything for a cold one
Wishes she could find her way home

Got the look on her face
And her stare's like a ray gun
As we walked by everything and
I wished there's something I could do for her

May be If I
Took a little time to talk
Then she'd heal a little if she wants to
She can run but let's teach her
How to walk away now
I'll shake a little if she wants to
Laugh a little if she needs to
There's a key to the door that she's hiding behind

She watches the world pass her by like a freight train
And they all call her the same names
Laughing as they point and stare at her

So she cries out to god up in heaven
Been praying since she was eleven
For him to send someone to meet her there

May be If I
Took a little time to talk
Then she'd heal a little if she wants to
She can run but let's teach her
How to walk away now
I'll shake a little if she wants to she'll
Laugh a little if she needs to
There's a key to the door that she's hiding behind

And no one knows the thoughts and the dreams and ideas
That she's got and contains inside
She's so broken apart
And her hearts is still looking for somewhere to feel alright

And no one knows the thoughts and the dreams and ideas
That she's got and contains inside
She's so broken apart
And her hearts is still looking for somewhere to feel alright

On those drives
We had a million questions
All about our lives
And when we got to New York
Everything felt right
I wish you were here with me
Tonight

I remember the days we spent together
Were not enough
And it used to feel like dreamin'
Except we always woke up
Never thought not having you
Here now would hurt so much

Tonight I've fallen and I can't get up
I need your loving hands to come and pick me up
And every night I miss you
I can just look up
And know the stars are
Holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you tonight

I remember the time you told me about when you were eight
And all those things you said that night that just couldn't wait
I remember the car you were last seen in
And the games we would play
All the times we spilled our coffees
And stayed out way too late
I remember when you said and told me about your Jesus
And how not to look back even if no one believes us
When it hurt so bad sometimes
Not having you here...

I sing,
""Tonight I've fallen and I can't get up
I need your loving hands to come and pick me up
And every night I miss you

Am I losing my mind?

If I try will You open my eyes?
And make me a part of You, like You're a friend of mine

Next time I'm losing my mind
I'll remember that to find my way out
Is just a waste of time
In place of all my mistakes
You've seen through the shadows above me
No one could ever love me like You

If I finish what I started
Or get swept under the carpet
I'll still be thankful for all You've done
I'll take a note to remind me
But You know where You can find me
I'll probably end up right back here again

Am I losing my mind?
Sometimes I feel like things are getting worse in time

I'll be everything that You want me to except for perfect
I'm trying hard just to understand Your plan for me
I'll be everywhere that You want me to, unless I fall

Keep you there

Give me a good bye said out loud
Give me the day with no memories

By the rain and the palm of the valley
But you're there by the tube stop in the freezing rain

Shit out of luck,
Trying to find some food,
And somewhere warm to rest.

He finds a cardboard box,
He's sorted for the night.
If he can brave the cold,
He'll be alright.
He'll move on slowley,
And find another place.
Tomorrow's started for the lonely,
The walking dead!

Another child goes missing,
Because of something said.
Their parents wishing,
That they don't turn up dead.
Not part of the statistics,
Forgotten and alone.
Pushed to the back of,
The thoughts of the collective soul.

Somewhere along the line they lost control.
The final straw that snapped and caused the fall.

But that doesn't mean that we should just,
Ignore their rights, they're also human beings.",The Walking Dead

Foesum,"DJ Glaze-
Well leave it up to me to come tight with mine
DJ Glaze one time with the bomb ass rhyme
slidin round the beach with the west coast sound
and if I see you on my team then I just might clown
325 with the chrome Anterra
caddy blue paint make them skirts want to stare at me
as I dips around the way
and ya know its all good like them OGs say
now I'm freestylin to a brand new track
and its bumpin like the back of a 83 Lac
but don't get me in no twist
because I never thought we'd ever see a day like this
T-Dubb's in a Fleetwood and ya can't fade it
M's in a six-fo and its gold plated
from here on out its smooth sailin
so let me bounce like zap and keep bellin

(Chorus) x2
Listen to the sound when we pass it around
as we buzz around the world with the west coast sound
you can just clown or be down wit it
but I'm a keep bouncin around wit it

M&M-
Now I'm comin in leanin, crawlin and creepin
dippin in the ride and I'm hoppin when I'm leavin
layin low, blowin smoke out my nose
got some gin in my lap and now I'm ready to roll
so I'm a make all you fools recognize me
'cause I get more skirts between the sheets than the Isleys
and gettin loaded is how we kick it
if ya down come hang wit the sly slick and wicked
slappin bones wit the homeys
tossin up 40s, rollin in a fo with a skirt bumpin oldies
get my hustle on whenever ends one mo
dice in my pocket what they hittin fo
hittin ventures on the one time can get caught up
since that three strike rule got brought up
head to the bud spot and pick up an ounce
and dip back to the hood, fool and I'm out

(Chorus) x2
Listen to the sound when we pass it around
as we buzz around the world with the west coast sound
you can just clown or be down wit it
but I'm a keep bouncin around wit it

T-Dubb-
Here I come bouncin, slidin, glidin
headed to the front Long Beach eastside
hop front and back let me scoop up M
'cause he's sittin in the park and he's all bombed in
I'm feelin kinda fine so you know what's right
layin back bumpin Tonight's The Night
so may I continue as the story unfolds
I love to see them skirts do the tootsie roll
with a hell of a body, no shame in the game
so hurry up and pass T-Dubb the Mary Jane
as I'm leanin out the window of a droptop fo
sippin Christian Brothers Lina pour me some mo
dippin, flossin, creepin and crawlin
feelin like a real OG 'cause we ballin
hit the switch now scrapes the ground
and that's how I clown when I'm puttin it down

Foesum,"M&M-
Now I never knew life would get this hectic
I find myself caught up, more than I expected
but I still take time out to make my rounds
and kick it with the homeys to show I'm still down
'cause I never forget where I been and what we went through
to go to this point of this game that we're into
just 'cause I'm in the spotlight don't mean I've changed
I'm still down to kick it doin everyday thangs
hangin wit the homeys kickin back playin bones
rollin up a fat sack to keep us in the zone
fit to get my drink on fool and reminisce
about the good and bad times we seen ever since
so I'm stayin true to my crew and myself
got the homeys back anytime they need some help
always lookin out for my peeps Glaze and Dubb
and I ain't trippin I'm just showin homey love

(Chorus)
Some things never change
ain't it strange, how its the same old thang
Some things never change
ain't it strange, how things just remain the same

Trippin on a memory, do you remember thee
Filipino G from the LBC
as I, continue on a mission trying to make ends meet
kickin trump tight rhymes over bomb ass beats
wait up, I been missin but fool I ain't trippin
when you see me on the streets you know I'm down for the dippin
slippin, hell nah 'cause if you knew what I knew
then you'd probably stay true like I do, believe that
I can't fade it when these hoes want to jock
and actin funny 'cause I'm rollin wit the G in my pocket, drop it
'cause its all about the homeys that was down from day one
tryin to real knowin where ya came from
so chill as I'm goin for mines
while I break it down to you straight line for line
so don't try to re-arrange me
because you know some things never change G

(Chorus)
Some things never change
ain't it strange, how its the same old thang
Some things never change
ain't it strange, how things just remain the same

T-Dubb-
Now some things change but I keep it in focus
I bring it to you real so they label me the Locc
I hope this, brings you to a better understanding
how it came to see as we represent the LB
'cause everyday life, well its a struggle for me
I gots to handle my business and stay down with the homeys
when you're in the rap game
and when you can't kick it, the homeys think you changed
now knowin that I'm only tryin to make a grip
so that I can have thangs, so don't even trip
don't ya know you been down so you considered my Locc
we goin still kick back and blaze up the smoke
and take a G ride when its time to put it work
and grab a few brews and lay low wit the skirts
'cause nevertheless I remain the same
so I'm a keep it real and stay true to the game

ain't it strange, how its the same old thang

ain't it strange, how things just remain the same",Some Things Never Change
Foesum,"Now if my memory's correct, then I'm a take you back 
on a trip through the past but its more than that 
as we break it down to ya from beginning to end 
Long Beach is the city where it all begins (Eastside) 
started out flowin for the homeys all the time 
'cause the click I was with was over kickin gangsta rhymes 
they were tight and we were tapin em 
So yo Dubb (what up) 
won't you tell em where you takin em 

[T-Dubb] 
Now lets take a trip down memory lane 
when things first started but its not the same 
when life with the Dubb in a way was kinda hopeless 
sipped out with the crew now its all in focus 
layin back kickin dope rhymes with my kin 
Glaze, M&M, Dubb, and Twin 
growin up from neighborhood kids on the block 
damn, who'd a eva thought 

(Chorus) 
Who would've eva thought, we would still be down 
with this laid back love, and this old G sound 
its so good, so goooooood, its so good, so goooooood 

[DJ Glaze] 
Can you relate to what I'm sayin as the struggle begins 
when ya livin life low and you short on ends 
when ya dreams look like they neva come true 
and your homeys never seem to come through 
but they say it ain't right without a struggle I guess 
so I sip the Tanquerey to keep my mind off the stress 
they wouldn't even listen to the sound 
so M&M would you please explain how it went down 

[M&M] 
Now I can take you back in the days from giddy up (yeah) 
ends was kinda low so the homeys did me up 
tight like phat, we were down you couldn't fade us 
even though things wouldn't turn out in our favor (hell nah) 
and I remember them days, I thought the group would split 
people clowned us, doubt us, but we still didn't quit 
and through the years we've been through a lot 
damn, who'd a eva though 

(Chorus) 
Who would've eva thought, we would still be down 
with this laid back love, and this old G sound 
its so good, so goooooood, its so good, so goooooood

Well now its 96 and I'm loungin wit tha homeys (what) 
NBA Jam on the fifty inch Sony 
plushed out krib wit the Benz in the driveway 
chillin on the hills of Pacific Coast Highway (right) 
ballin, outta control, with my peeps 
got brand new kicks for every day of the week 
damn I hear somebody subbin (who is it) 
in a Lexus 400 its the homey T-Dubb 

[T-Dubb] 
Now they call me big daddy Dubb with a beat in the trunk 
so I crack a brew and smoke a Philly blunt 
with the diamond in the back and a sun roof top 
diggin in the scene with the flossy lean 
got my papes and its great that we finally made it 
'cause we stayed sucka free, so you know you can't fade it 
blowin up the industry to make or not 
now, who'd a eva thought

today i started slogging - again

according to me, mister marquis,
you mix up passion and cruelty cos passion extinguishes sympathy
and makes you cold and hard like me
stronger and stronger charms are needed to satisfy the passion and pain awakens nerves
when you lust in this fashion the pain of others also causes extraordinary excitation
and this cruelty shows your energy not your generation
horrible spectacle, execution, slaughter, disease and death
you aint tasted nothing 'til you got foetus on your breath
today i started slogging - again
today i started slogging - again
today i started slogging - again
today i started slogging - again
castration, masturbation, flagellation, come on, use your imagination
you may need lubrication for the appropriate preparation
so tighten up the thumbscrews, put on this evening gown
and no one leaves til their extremities are dragging on the ground
today i started slogging - again
today i started slogging - again
today i started slogging - again
today i started slogging - again
you wont get hungry, everything's swallowed
nothin goes to waste
cos once its been down your throat a few times it's not such a bitter taste
so come on, hit me one time and lets blaspheme my friend
get up get down get sideways aint no party and it never ends

Nightmare walkin', creepin' through the lonely nights,
I wake up with the rising sun,
Try to work away the days, keep my troubles on the run.
Nowhere to hide, nightmare ruin my life.

I wake up from my sleep, I got nightmares on my mind,
Walk around in circles to pass away the time,
I hear the bell tonin' and I see the mornin' light,
Pour myself a drink, but I lost my appetite,
I can't sleep at all, 'cause my dreams are all so bad,
When I get to thinkin' it's about to drive me mad.
See our love dyin' and my eyes begin to burn,
My mind is so confused, I don't know which way to turn.

Try to work away the days, keep my troubles on the run.

It's hard to love somebody, and leave her all the time,
It's hard to be a friend, easy to be unkind,
You treat me like a stranger, and I can understand,
'Cause you're a lonely woman, and I'm a travelin' man, well.

Lookin' through the window, I saw you wave goodbye,
I tried to raise a smile, all I could do was cry,
A man needs a woman, to stand by his side,
And I need you, to keep me satisfied.

Well, I hate to see you cry,
Wipe the water from your eye,
I'd love to hear you say, you need me anyway,
There's one thing you should know,
I hate to see, hate to see you go.

Well if you ever leave me, I'll be the one to blame,
But I never gambled to play a losin' game,
My cards are on the table, I ain't a cheatin' man,
I'm livin' for your lovin', I hope you understand.

Makin' love, and the world stops turning.
Your body's so warm and your lips are like honey.
Into the night, well I'm driftin' and driftin',
I'm caught in a dream, I'm lost but not lonely.

The world stops turnin' and time stands still,
Feels like the night will last forever,
When love is in motion (love in motion)
When love is in motion (love in motion)

Deep inside, I can feel it comin',
A river of love, rollin' over my body.
Driftin' with the tide,
I don't care where it takes me,
Carry me on, roll me over and over.

The world stops turnin' and time stands still,
Feels like the night will last forever,
When love is in motion (love in motion)
When love is in motion (love in motion)

No time to worry, no time to lose,
I can't see clearly but I can't be confused.
No love can be as strong as this,
I can't take it but I just can't resist.
Oh no, oh no.

Slow and easy, night is young,
Need someone to love you? Let me be the one.
Lay back baby, let the good feeling flow,
Love is coming and I'm losing control.

And now you're stumbling like a jailbird on the run,
Love arrests you and you don't know what you've done.

I ba-ba-babble like a tongue-tied man, honey, that's what love can do.
I talk sweet talk no one can understand, baby, that's what love can do.
I shake and shiver, baby, cry you a river, honey, that's what love can do.

Well, you wake feeling good, but you sleep so bad,
And you keep cryin' all the time.
To your friends' concern, you tell 'em I'm not mad,
But you think that you've lost your mind.
Though it don't come easy, take it honey, this may be your chance.
The night goes on forever, when you're lookin' for romance.

I ba-ba-babble like a tongue-tied man, honey, that's what love can do.
I talk sweet talk no one can understand, baby, that's what love can do.
I shake and shiver, baby, cry you a river, honey, that's what love can do.

The way you walk ain't walkin', it's something mama don't allow.
Let your hips do the talkin', and pretend you don't know how.
Ruby red, oh baby blue,
Heaven knows what I can for you,
When you're out there, doin' the Zig-Zag Walk.

Stiletto heels in stockin's, trace the seam up to the top.
And you're daring me to touch you, but I won't know where to stop.
A little rude, that's what you say,
It must be hard to keep the wolves at bay,
When you're out there, doin' the Zig-Zag Walk.

Zig-zag, well it's my kinda move,
Big drag if I can't cut the groove,
No stone gonna be unturned,
When you're walkin', walkin' and a-talkin',
Baby, doin' the Zig-Zag Walk.
Uh, doin' that walk.

The way we love ain't lovin', don't do nothin' for my heart.
Just a physical attraction, you're the bulls-eye - I'm the dart.
At least I know the way you feel,
Don't care nothing for a love that's real,
When you're out there, doin' the Zig-Zag Walk.

Zig-zag, walk like Marilyn Monroe,
Zig-zag, talk like Brigitte Bardot,
No stone gonna be unturned,
When you're out there, walkin' and a talkin',
Baby, doin' the Zig-Zag Walk.

Doin' that walk...

Done got cloudy and it started to rain, I tooted my horn til I passed the lane,
Rain water blowin' all under my hood, I knew that I was doin' my motor good,

Shanghaied at midnight, to some sleazy motel,
The blonde leading the blind, ah, she does it so well!
A view of the highway, four walls and a bed,
She's taking me down now and I'm so easily lead.
She's got me right there where she wants,
Where she can work me all night long.

Motel shaker, tangled in sheets, the more she gets, the more she needs.
Motel shaker, shaking the walls, three in the morning and she wants it all.

She puts on her red dress and that's a dangerous sign,
With her first-rate body and her one-track mind.
Heart shakin' like an earthquake, just a little more fun,
When you think it's all over, well she's hardly begun.
She don't care what they can hear next door,
She just wants to get what she came for.

Motel shaker, tangled in sheets, the more she gets, the more she needs.
Motel shaker, shaking the walls, the neighbors are knockin', but she ain't stopping.

Motel shaker, tangled in sheets, the more she gets, the more she needs.
Motel shaker, shaking the walls, three in the morning and she wants it all.

{Rod - Slide Solo}
Woo! Yeah! Shake it baby!

She loves to shake me all night long,
But in the morning she'll be gone, she'll be gone.

Motel shaker, tangled in sheets, the more she gets, the more she needs.
Motel shaker, shaking the walls, the neighbors are knockin', she ain't stoppin',

Motel shaker, tangled in sheets, the more she gets, the more she needs.
Motel shaker, shaking the walls, they keep on knockin', but she ain't stoppin'.

In darkness and shadows - a place I call home.

You kill me with kindness, 'til I feel no pain,
Angel of mercy when you call my name.

And now more than ever, in these ever-changing times,
Your love can help me, ease my troubled mind.

You kill me with kindness, 'til I feel no pain,

I looked for trouble and I found it son,
Straight down the barrel of a lawman's gun.
I'd try to run but I don't think I can,
You make one move and you're a dead man, friend.

Ain't livin' long like this,
Can't live at all like this, can I baby?
He slipped the handcuffs on behind my back,
Then left me freezin' on a steel rail rack.
Can't sleep at all in the jailhouse baby,
Ain't livin' long like this.

Grew up in Houston on the wayside drive,
Son of a car hop in some all night dive.
Dad drove a stock car to an early death,
All I remember was a drunk man's breathe.

Ain't livin' long like this,
Can't live at all like this, can I baby?
We know the story how the wheel goes 'round,
Don't let 'em take you to the man downtown,
They got 'em all in the jailhouse baby.

I wasn't botherin' nobody, I wasn't botherin' a soul.
I saw a woman's picture on a wanted sign,
She had the face of an angel and the eyes of a child.
So I moved a little closer, just to dig her face,
I wondered why was it hangin' now, in this lonely place?
There was fine threads hangin' beneath her face, like clothes hangin' on a line.

Well lo' and behold, to my surprise, she laid a kiss on me, hotter than a brandin' iron.
She came on tough, and she came on strong,
She cowtied my soul, now I can't leave here alone.
And when she told me to buck, I bucked, she told me to moo, I mooed.

I left school at sixteen, tired of the routine, money is what I need.
I got into the job line, but there's no work for my kind,
No school tie and no degree, no chance for me.

I found some employment, but still no enjoyment, I worked in a factory.
I picked up my wages, fhe first time in ages, it don't seem enough to me.
The years go by in slow time, became a man in no time,
You came along, the time was right - turned on the light.

I spent my vacation down at the station, waving to all the trains.
After this deep depression, I shoulda' learned my lesson
I found you in the nick of time, who'll buy the wine?

Tire through a puddle, threw some mud in my face.

I took my chances on the underground.

In desperation, I looked for a taxi, but, oh, the searching was in vain.

Too late the hero, from ten down to zero.
Too late the hero, why did she say, ""Boy, boy you're way too late!""?
She said ""Boy, boy you're way too late!""

I caught a train but there was nowhere to sit,
Reached for a strap, I thought I heard something rip,
There on the Central Line, my pants fell apart.
Train broke down and we were stuck in the dark.

Subway tunnel claustrophobia, best suit, wrinkled and damp,
Finally when I crawled up to her door, she said, ""Goodbye chump!""
Too late the hero, from ten down to zero.
Too late the hero, why did she say, ""Boy, boy you're way too late!""?
She said ""Boy, boy you're way too late!""

Did I see someone in the shadow? Did I hear footsteps on the floor?
Did I hear laughter in the background just before she slammed that door?

{Instrumental}

I turned around and I headed home, I was tired, rejected and cold.
Missed the last train, left around midnight, so I walked that lonesome road.
Too late the hero, from ten down to zero.
Too late the hero, why did she say, ""Boy, boy you're way too late!""?
She said ""Boy, boy you're way too late!""
(Too late, too late the hero) Way too late.
(Too late, too late the hero) Way too late.
(Too late, too late the hero) Way too late,
Too late hey hey hey...

Baggy suit and flashy tie, blue of knuckle, red of eye,
He's one of the boys, he's a wide boy.

He'd sell his mother for a quid, rumour has it that he did,
He's one of the boys, he's a wide boy.

He used to be his father's pride, 'til he spent a year inside,
He's one of the boys, he's a wide boy.

Six feet from shoulder to shoulder and five feet from the ground,
Iron fists, a head like a boulder - a friend like that is good to have around!

At the club he's set to pounce, girls to chat and boys to bounce,
He's one of the boys, he's a wide boy.

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

The sun was so hot I froze myself
Suzanne, don't you go on and cry
I said, oh, Susannah
Now, don't you cry for me
As I come from Alabama with this banjo on my knee

Well I had myself a dream the other night
When everything was still
I dreamed that I saw my girl Suzanne
She was coming around the hill
Now, the buckwheat cake was in her mouth
A tear was in her eye

I said, that I come from Dixie land

Ici les jours passent, rien ne change vraiment dans les alentours
Coups tentants, mecs partis pour des aller sans retour
Tous attirés, ou presque par le biz, liasses et fesses, sex
Ici et là, ça rafle des tiroirs caisses, quoi
Qu'est-ce que tu veux faire contre ça
A force de faire miroiter, on veut juste ce qu'on voit
Le convoi, là-bas, le brinks alimente mes rêves des dizaines de fois
A croire que ça rapporte plus que le respect de la loi
Les gens honnêtes se crèvent la santé à ONET
L'Etat est le plus grand proxénète, bon biz, propre et net
Faut tenir le coup, se serrer les coudes,
Ne serait-ce que pour nos parents
Question francs, n'attend rien des gouvernants
Putain, qu'est-ce que tu veux que je dise aux gosses en fasse de moi
Qui font plus de thunes en un jour que moi dans le mois
Comment leur dire de retourner au lycée
C'est croix sur les cours, cours pour le fric et les gatsés
Avec le 12 carats, elles tombent dans tes bras
Vas-y, sors le 24 et t'as droit au kamasutra
Quel argument opposer à ces pseudos vies d'idylles ?
Le simple fait d'avoir la conscience tranquille
Ça s'en fout bien pas mal, tant que le cash régale,
Ça croit courir plus vite que les balles si le plan se déroule mal
La morale aujourd'hui, c'est moi qui te la fais
Demain peut-être essayerai-je d'élaborer le plan parfait
La tentation, cherche, tu peux peut-être lutter
L'appel de l'argent, des femmes,
Gazier, essaye au mieux d'y résister
Mes péchés, je crois que je m'en laverai plus tard
Pour l'instant, je fais avec ce que j'ai même si ça me fait chier
J'essaye de lutter et je dis bien, j'essaye
Qu'est-ce que tu veux on est pas des MC's gatés
Les coups faciles et foireux qui rapportent gros, foutaise
Je laisse ça à Scorcese

J'envoie sur Fonkyson toujours le même béton pour horizon
Baisons ce système qui nous mène la vie dure
Fureur de vaincre au fond du c?ur, convaincre et lutter sans peur
Accablé de reproches
Pourtant on défend nos proches avant nos poches
Et les mômes accrochent, le son des canailles mauvais garçon
Don Choa Fonky Family équipe d'acharnés sans rémission
Pourquoi on se calmerait ? On vit pas dans les palmeraies
T'endors pas, garde un ?il ouvert, tiens-toi prêt gamin
La force est dans ta tête, la puissance dans tes mains
Je prétends pas montrer le chemin
Mais c'est aujourd'hui qu'on construit demain
Je sème des rimes, tant pis si je passe pour fada que je récolte nada
Je reste Hip-Hop, soldat sans jamais baisser devant les liasses
Comme le reste de la populace
Mais y'a que dans les rêves que je me retrouve en place plus rien au réveil
Sous un soleil de plomb représente du sud au nord
N'espère rien du président, l'Etat dort sur un tas d'or

Le thème c'est art de rue, dédié à ceux qui pratiquent
Et ceux qui aiment ce putain d'art de rue,
Ceux qui dansent sur la piste, sur la pierre ou à la zon,
Ceux qui mixent, ceux qui parlent sur la zique
Et ceux qui taguent sur les fourgons,
C'est un mode de vie, une chose qui nous rend sérieux,
Ami, un besoin unique vécu jour et nuit,
On désire toujours faire mieux, vu que la vie n'est qu'un test,
Et que toutes les situations sont complexes
On pense l'esprit dit fait le, fonce, tant qu'on respire et qu'on est libre,
Y'a qu'à oser, vieux savourer l'existence comme on peut,
L'essentiel est de faire ce qu'on aime et comme on veut,
Morveux, le rap c'est bon quand tu fais ça par amour,
Mais pas quand y a beaucoup de fric enjeu,
On se rend compte qu'une fois coincé dans le cercle vicieux
C'est un salut aux anges et aux dangereux,
C'est un salut aux jeunes de France de la zone et de l'opéra,
Aux anciens qui ont pratiqué l'art de la danse, comme SDA,
Ceux qui taguent sur les trains, les murs crades,
Et là ou ça craint comme sur les palais et les commissariat,
Salut à ceux qui parlent sur la musique,
Ceux qui décrivent, joie, angoisse, haine et amour,
Sans méthode précise et sans être alléché par l'appas du gain,
Mais juste parce qu'il en éprouve le besoin,
On en a marre de rire, gloire à l'art de rue,
Dédié aux gens durs et à tout ceux de ta rue,

Que nous payons en liquides et rarement par chèque,
Gardons la fois dans ces périodes où tout est sec,
Même au plus bas dans la merde, on ne lâchera pas le steak,
On l'a déjà dit, mec, c'est nous contre eux dans tous les duels,
Il en reste jamais deux dans nos ruelles,
Senior ne vient pas qui veut
Notre politique on l'ignore dans nos quartiers,
C'est ce qui peut si ça va pas, on s'en remettra à Dieu,
Sa puissance exauce nos v?ux, que la gloire sont dans nos rues,
Dans cet art qui tue, ça encouragerait tous qui on crut,
Ma famille, la Fonky F, et le crew dans ce monde,
Où tout est flou, on essayera de faire notre trou,
Dans cette ambiance scandale, danse des chacals,

Dans ce qu'on entreprend faut être des morfales,

Vu ou ça m'a mené, j'aurai pu me passer d'aller à l'école,
Fumer de la drogue ou boire de l'alcool,
Mais comment me passer de rapper,
Sur ma vie cette musique constitue encore un des rares trucs qui m'anime,
J'ai pas confiance en l'argent, ça passe d'un compte d'une main,
D'une poche à une autre et fait même s'entretuer les nôtres,
Je ne fais pas confiance aux femmes, ça passe d'un homme à un autre,
De l'arrière d'une caisse, d'un lit à un autre,
Note que dans nos têtes c'est le vrai désordre,
Pour preuve je rappe des trucs qu'on rien à voir les uns avec les autres,
This is a man's world, je m'en rends compte quand je suis au plus mal,
Bien die, ou fucked up, je ne suis pas doué pour le vol ou pour le deal,
Je rappe pour vivre, c'est toujours mieux
Que d'avoir les flics qui me poursuivent,
Je ne fais pas ça pour les femmes, ni avoir trop de fans,
Ni pour voir ces rimes classées profanes,
Gloire à l'art de rue, si tu vivais ce qu'on voit,
Je suis prêt à parier que t'exprimerais les mêmes faits que moi,
On est pas si loin du chaos, nul n'est à l'abri d'être au plus bas,
Penses-y au cas où tu serais amené à fumer ce qu'on fume,
Boire ce qu'on boit, vivre ce qu'on voit, ou livrer ce combat,
Dehors, c'est la guerre, même si tu ne veux pas le croire,
Y'a aussi de l'amour partout même dans mon rap,

Pour changer de point de vue, reconnaître l'erreur.

Soudain ils voient tout s'effondrer.

Avant faudra qu'on parle histoire d'établir le contact.

Azul sólo era su cola de ahí pa' arriba era negra
Juliana siempre me ha dicho que se llaman julianitas

Hombre que suerte la mía, poder tener esta vida

Ay mi lagartija que come araña, corre por la casa
La salamanqueja que la acompaña, trepa la pitaya
Mi vieja vecina que las cuidaba, yo que las buscaba
Y si por los techos no caminaban, ay las añoraba

Como les venía diciendo estaba yo hipnotizado
Que vengan de cola azul eso si es un invento raro
Juliana siempre me dijo que mire al techo y al piso
Por cada lobito visto es un deseo concedido

Me acuerdo que mi vecina, armaba una algarabía
Deja la salamanqueja, que de pronto se nos vuela
Recuerdos que no se olvidan, colores que me fascinan

Que sigan que busquen adentro
E' mi casa que sigan que busquen

Al despertar yo agradezco
Lo mucho que yo te quiero
Lo que te llevo por dentro
No me vayas a dejar

Y no me dejes y no me dejes

Catalina, me sube la temperatura
Me pongo a la piragua
Te llevo por las aguas
Te llevo por las aguas

I like the way that you feel the groove
I like your style, baby, I love you
I like your feet when your dancing with the moon

Y aparezco entre tus sueños
Y mi cariño es sincero
Y cada vez que te veo
De amor por ti me muero

Catalina, me sube la temperatura
Me pongo a la piragua
Te llevo por las aguas

Me duermo contigo yo, me sueño contigo yo
Mi amor me lo llevo adentro
Me duermo contigo yo, me sueño contigo yo
Tu amor lo llevo por dentro

Dime esta noche tu lo mismo a mi
Nada te puedo decir

Llevo acá dentro una grabación
Que me repite una frase de amor

No creo que ahora tu me quieras mas

I hope you never see me wind up

Will I be happy on the back of the shelf?
Will you be happy when we're sharing a cell?
Spare me the questions since you know me so well
Someday you'll realize I get shy and I choke up!
Want a song that's indelible, like manimal,
I hope you never see me wind up
What is wrong with this animal?
I'm terrible
I hope you never see me wind up

Keep you at a distance from the things that I felt
I'll bite the bullet, take the beating until
I take it all back anyway.

You've such a delicate wrist
And if I give it a twist
Something to hold when I lose my grip
Will I find something in there
To give me just what I need
Another reason to bleed
One by one hidden up my sleeve (one by one hidden up my sleeve)

Don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down
Don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down

Will I find a believer
Another one who believes
Another one to deceive
Over and over down on my knees
If I get any closer
And if you open up wide
And if you let me inside
On and on I've got nothing to hide (on and on I've got nothing to hide)

Don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste

Were you born to resist, or be abused?
I swear I'll never give in, I refuse

Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
You trust, you must confess

Foo Fighters,"When she goes storming out
I run for cover
Rolling like thunder clouds
Hanging above her

Ring in the witching hour
Spells that I'm singing
Rain come and drown me out
Sinking deep alone

Can you go another round?
I will follow you down and out
Lets go another round
I will follow you down and

We could just lay around
Stare at the ceiling
Want to forget about
One for the feeling

Room full of photographs
Box full of letters
Come on make it last
Nothing else matters right now

Can you go another round?
I will follow you down and out
Lets go another round
I will follow you down and out

Can you go another round?
I will follow you down and out
Lets go another round
I will follow you down and out

Lets go another round
I will bother you down and out
Lets go another round
I will follow you down and out",Another Round
Foo Fighters,"I've got another confession to make
I'm your fool
Everyone's got their chains to break
Holdin' you

Were you born to resist or be abused?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?

Are you gone and onto someone new?
I needed somewhere to hang my head
Without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have
But had no use
I was too weak to give in
Too strong to lose
My heart is under arrest again
But I break loose
My head is giving me life or death
But I can't choose
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
Its real, the pain you feel
You trust, you must
Confess
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Oh

Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh

Has someone taken your faith?
Its real, the pain you feel
The life, the love
You die to heal
The hope that starts
The broken hearts
You trust, you must
Confess

Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?

I've got another confession my friend
I'm no fool
I'm getting tired of starting again
Somewhere new

Were you born to resist or be abused?
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
Its real, the pain you feel
You trust, you must
Confess

Foo Fighters,"Take a high dive in to your brain
Made your only cause
Just might wear your welcome out if you don't' let It go

There's nothing that you couldn't say Cauze you Said it all before
Think it's time you walked this lonely road all on Your own

So it's your cold day in the sun
Looks like your bleeding heart has already won

I could take it away
Save you from yourself
You get so lost inside your head like no one else
Looking for someone to blame
Blame me all along
You take the heat but you would never take the Fall

It's your cold day in the sun
Looks like your bleeding heart has already won

You're so afraid that you are the only one
But you are the only one you know
Don't be afraid 'cause you're not the only one
You're not the only one I know

It's your cold day in the sun
Looks like your bleeding heart has already won
It's your cold day in the sun
Looks like your bleeding heart has already won",Cold Day in the Sun
