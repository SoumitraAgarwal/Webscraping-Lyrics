Berlin,"Something you've heard
Somewhere you've seen
Too real to ignore
You've chosen not to believe
From the black of their pain
To the white of their fear
In the dust they die
While eden lies near

The freedom bought,
Changed hands, was sold
This heat of love has turned ice-cold

We just can't escape it
Like flames reaching out from the sun
We can't defeat it
Like flames reaching out from the sun

From the garden of love,
Been banished too long
And the balance will shift
Between the week and the strong
Once they would beg and they would plead
But now they demand
Divided by those that need
And those that command

The freedom bought,
Changed hands, was sold
The heat of love has turned ice-cold and
We never learn but we know too well
Heaven's died and gone to hell

Now you watch but you shoud have run
Like flames that leap from the base of the sun
And you dream you're free but you'll awake
Too much too late, too much too late",Like Flames
Berlin,"So quickly time will come and time will go
It runs on by
It steals your hopes and dreams and one last chance
You never know

I can see it now
I can feel its scolding hand
Saying come on now you've got to run

You wonder can you stop the hands of time
Erase your fate
He's laughing, knowing that he's got control
Just watch and wait

I can see it now
I can hear the whispered voice
Telling me now you've got no time to waste

It's a matter of time
It's just a matter of time

And you've got to see
You have the answer, you have the strength
There's no denying it's in your hands
It's in your hands

It's a matter of time

Living breathing touching feeling
Hoping dreaming still deceiving
Searching finding losing crying
Know the truth you're dying
Oh you're dying

It's a matter of time

Remember who you are and what you have
The time is yours
Your flame is burning down so guard it well
It may go out

I can see it now
I can see the end of time
Holding the answers to all your fears

It's a matter of time",Matter of Time
Berlin,"You broke into my life
And stole my heart
Without a single clue
You fell apart
Well, now you're back again
And say you've changed
Well, I've got news for you
You're guilty just the same

Now it's my turn
Now it's my turn
You hurt me then
I'll never let you hurt me again

Sweet surrender found me
On my knees
My eyes were full of love
I could not see
You left the scene of the crime
Hit and run
Don't think you'll get away
The pain has just begun

Now it's my turn
Now it's my turn
You hurt me then
I'll never let you hurt me again
Now it's my turn
Oh, you'll never learn
Just like me you'll be
A casualty of your love

You have the right
To remain silent
Anything you say can
And will be used against you
In a court of love

Now it's my turn
Now it's my turn
You hurt me then
I'll never let you hurt me again
Now it's my turn
Oh, you'll never learn
Just like me you'll be
A casualty of your love",Now It's My Turn
Berlin,"We cross the street
You hold my hand
Afraid to let go and if I walked away
And left you there
Would you know why

You are the answer now
You don't know
You can be everything
You don't know
You won't believe it now
You don't know anymore
You are the reason and the rhyme

We walk into your room
A mirror's caught your reflection
You walk away and call to me
To fill in the frame

You are the only one
You don't know
You are the fire of love
You don't know
You can believe it now
You don't know anymore
You are the reason and the rhyme

I walk this road
You follow me
I don't know why

And if I walked away
And left you there
Would you know why?",You Don't Know
Berlin,"I see you every night
I pull your strings
You dance for me, you laugh, I make you sing
I want complete control
I say when
Let's try again

I see you every day
You walk on by
I try to speak but then I wonder why
I have you every night all to myself
Never alone
Asleep, you're gone

I wrote a line or two
Tried to explain
In your morality it's not the same
I want you on your knees
I want you down
Never a sound

You could be, yes you could be, the one I love
You could be the sexy thing I'm dreaming of
You could spend the night with me 
And never know you were here
In my dreams
You could be, yes you could be, my slow romance
You could be a master in my lovers' dance
You could scream out loud and
There's no one to hear, only me
In my dreams",In My Dreams
Berlin,"You're driving along...about 95 miles and hour
Sun's up, it's a hot day
And blue sky, there's not a soul around you
You're alone
Hey little god with your foot to the pedal
Hands on the wheel staring out through the windshield
Hair streaking back with the wind like a raven
Over your shoulder, all is forgotten
Under the rubber, the road is afire
Sweat on your body and rust on the chromium
One motivation, a single desire
Keep on the move, don't let anyone near you
Here comes confession time
The ghost of my past
On my shoulder now
This is confession time for me
Here comes confession time
The ghost of all
The years has tracked me down
It's confession time for me
Now thinking back to a home
When you had one
Back down the road
In the dust you remember
Loves you left
When you woke up surrounded
Now you're alone, no one
To turn to
What do you hide with your ray-bans
What do you love when you look in the mirror
There's no escape from the voices inside you
Here comes confession time
The ghost of my past
On my shoulder now
This is confession time for me
Here comes confession time
The ghost of all
The years has tracked me down
It's confession time for me
Rain down
And nowhere to hide
Nowhere to hide
Rain on me
Rain down
And nowhere to hide
Nowhere to hide
You can drive on a road to nowhere
Or you can take the wheel and
Turn it to your heart
It's your life it's your life",Confession Time
Berlin," You can buy me a daquiri
You can take me home and tear my clothes off
Here am I. Married? No, I'm celibate, ha ha

Want a 'lude, I don't care
The feeling's numb but we cry, oh, aah
Here am I making sure you get your share

Well, isn't this a night
You have a wife, a little girl at home
Never mind, nice to know you, wave goodbye

Touch, touch, touch me, can you stay tonight?
I don't want you to leave my side
Talk, talk, talk to me, I need to know
Will you remember me tomorrow?

Well, if you say you love me I might believe
that you see something special in me
And then the days go by and you're not there
If you want me, touch me, touch me now",Touch
Berlin,"I've been waking in a state of fire
From a dream about you
And nothing's gonna cool me down
Till my dream comes true
Does it shoo the butterflies inside
When you meet me at the door
When I say hello and I kiss your mouth
Does it taste a lot like ... more?
CHORUS: 
I want to turn you on when you imagine me in lingerie
I want to make you hunger for the someday I will beg to stay
... Just to turn you on
Are you ready I can taste it all
But it's got to be right
And the candles and the sweet perfume
Are gonna touch you tonight
CHORUS: 
I want to turn you on I want to dance to some exotic song
I want to make you wonder if you still know right from wrong
I want to turn you on
(instrumental break)
Tell me this is more than just a masturbation fantasy
You're a hot erotic man
And I'm the master, you're the slave I need
Does that turn you on?
I want to turn you on
I've gotta turn you on",Turn You On

Berlin,"Rock star, sing my song
Be my brand new toy
You're a Marvel Man
A fallen poster boy

Rock star, sing my song
Make me yours alone
You're the highest high
The lowest of the low

You look down at me
I hear in whispers what you want
Seeing where you go
I follow on the spot

I want to know you I want to know your name
Push me to the wall
I want to know you I want to know you'll stay
I know I'm going to want it all
I want to know you I want to know your name
Sacred and profane

Rock star, sing my song
So close I hear you breathe
I love you Marvel Man

Push me to the wall

You're a dream, and my world is spinning
Round and round, out of control tonight

Through my great divide
Our two worlds collide

Berlin,"The night was young and wet that fateful day
You stepped out of the rain and looked my way
All of my cool disappeared
All I ever wanted was here
Gone is the time and the place
And every other face I've known
My life started the moment you said hello

With a touch
I am yours
With a kiss
I'm falling apart
When I look in your eyes 
There is nothing i can do
With a touch 
I am yours
With a kiss
You're breaking my heart
In a moment I'm lost
Now I succumb to you

Your conversation set me up to fall
We're through the door the streets
And over my walls
Your scent filled me deep, made me weak
I wanted you all over me

Gone is the time and a thousand reasons
You're a fantasy
Hearing my whispers turn into my screams

With a touch
I am yours
With a kiss
I'm falling apart
When I look in your eyes 
There is nothing i can do
With a touch 
I am yours
With a kiss 
You're breaking my heart
In a moment I'm lost

And the sharks try to cut a big piece out of life
It feels alright to go out to catch an outrageous thrill
But it's more like spinning wheels of fortune
Which never stand still

Big city, big city nights
You keep me burning
Big city, big city nights

When the sunlight is rising up in my eyes
And the long night has left me back at somebody's side
It feels alright for a long sweet minute like hours before
But it's more like looking out for something
I can't find anymore

Big city, big city nights

That you can't make true, if you're looking for love
But there's no girl
Who's burning the ice away from my heart

Children will look to you
For which way to turn
To learn what to be
Careful before you say
Listen to me
Children will listen

Careful the wish you make
Wishes are children
Careful the path they take
Wishes come true
Not free
Careful the spell you cast
Not just on children
Sometimes the spell may last
Past what you can see
And turn against you

Careful the tale you tell
That is the spell
Children will listen

Though it's fearful
Though it's deep, though it's dark
And though you may lose the path
Though you may encounter wolves
You can't just act
You have to listen
you can't just act
You have to think
Though it's dark
There are always wolves
There are always spells
There are always beans
Or a giant dwells there

So into the woods you go again
You have to every now and then
Into the woods, no telling when
Be ready for the journey
Into the woods, but not too fast
Or what you wish, you lose at last
Into the woods, but mind the past
Into the woods, but mind the future
Into the woods, but not to stray
Or tempt the wolf, or steal from the giant

The way is dark
The light is dim
But now there's you, me, her, and him
The chances look small
The choices look grim
But everything you learn there
Will help when you return there

The light is getting dimmer

I think I see a glimmer

Into the woods, you have to grope
But that's the way you learn to cope
Into the woods to find there's hope
Of getting through the journey
Into the woods, each time you go
There's more to learn of what you know
Into the woods, but not too slow
Into the woods, it's nearing midnight
Into the woods to mind the wolf
To heed the witch, to honor the giant
To mind, to heed, to find, to think, to teach, to join, to go to the festival
Into the woods
Into the woods
Into the woods
Then out of the woods
And happy ever after

I wish",Children Will Listen (Finale)
Bernadette Peters,"This is the world I meant
Couldn't you listen?
Couldn't you stay content?
Safe behind walls, as I could not

Now you know what's out there in the world
No one can prepare you for the world, even I
How could I, who loved you as you were
How could I have shielded you from her or them?

No matter what you say
Children won't listen
No matter what you know

Still they won't listen

To something you lose",Lament

You are ashamed of me

I'm trying to pretend
I don't know where you've been

Can't imagine what I'd have to say
Except my world would be right
If love comes back my way

I've always been
One to take each and every day
Seems like by now
I'd find a love who'd care
Care just for me

And we go running on faith
All of our dreams will come true
And our world will be right
If love comes over me and you

A clumsy Joe who wouldn't know a Rhumba from a Waltz.

He doesn't belong to me!)

The gentleman isn't bright
He doesn't know the score. 
A Cake will come, He'll take a crumb
And never ask for more.

But little do they see

Longin' to tell you
But afraid and shy
I'd let my golden chances

Bernadette Peters,"The things I used to like
I don't like anymore. 
I want a lot of other things 
I've never had before.
It's just like mother says...
I sit around and mope.
Pretending I am wonderful.
And knowing I'm a dope.
I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm,
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string.
I'd say that I had spring fever,
But I know it isn't spring.
I'm starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing.
Oh, why should I have spring fever
When it isn't even spring?
I keep wishing I were somewhere else, 
Walking down a strange new street.
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a man I've yet to meet.
I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams,
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing.
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud
Or a robin on the wing.
But I feel so gay,
In a melancholy way,
That it might as well be spring,
It might as well be spring.

In our air-conditioned, patent leather farmhouse,
On our ultra-modern, scientific farm,
We'll live in a stream-lined heaven,
And we'll waste no time on charm!
No geraniums to clutter our veranda,
Nor single little sentimental things,
No virginia creepers, nothing useless !

The earth is a-glow
And to add to the show,

Maybe it's more than the birds,
Maybe it's more than sight of the night,
In a light too lovely for words. 

Maybe it's more than the earth
Shiny in silvery blue.
Maybe the reason I'm feeling this way
Has something to do with you!

Bernadette Peters,"His name is Mister Snow,
And an up-standed man is he.
He comes home every night in his round-bottomed boat,
With a net full of herring from the sea.
An almost perfect beau,
As refined as a girl could wish.
But he spends so much time in his round-bottomed boat
That he can't seem to lose the smell of fish.

The first time he kissed me the whiff from his clothes
Knocked me flat on the floor of the room.
But now that I love him, my heart's in my nose
And fish is my fav'rite perfume!

Last night he spoke quite low,
And a fair-spoken man is he.
And he said ""Miss Pipperidge, I'd like it fine
If I could be wed with a wife.
And indeed, Miss Pipperidge, if you'll be mine,
I'll be yours for the rest of my life.""

Next moment we were promised,
And now my mind's in a maze.
For all it can do is look forward to
That wonderful day of days!

When I marry Mister Snow
The flowers'll be buzzin' with the hum of bees
The birds'll make racket in the church yard trees
When I marry Mister Snow
Then it's off to home we'll go.
And both of us'll look a little dreamy-eyed
A driving to a cottage by the Oceanside
Where the salty breezes blow.

He'll carry me 'cross the threshold,
And I'll be as meek as a lamb.
Then he'll set me on my feet,
And I'll say kinda sweet,
""Well, Mister Snow, here I am.""

Then I'll kiss him so he'll know
That evry'thin'll be as right as right can be
A living in a cottage by the sea with me
For I love that Mister Snow.
That young sea-faring,
Bold and daring,
Big bewhiskered, overbearing
Darling Mister Snow.

I will come as evening comes to woo a waiting sky. 
Out of my dreams and into the hush of falling shadows, 
When the mist is low and stars are breaking through 
Then out of my dreams I'll go Into a dream with you. 
Won't have to make up anymore stories 
You'll be there! 
Think of the bright midsummer night 
Glories we can share. 
Won't have to go on kissing a daydream 
I'll have you 
You'll be real 
Real as the white moon lighting the blue. 
Out of my dreams and into your arms I long to fly

Bernard Berkhout,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care

Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss

All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid

Bernard Butler,"Don't hold me to these words 
Cos to you they could mean anything 
But to me they are my everything 
I need to spin the world 

Don't hold me to these words 
Cos they'll hurt you more than melodies 
But to me they're more than empathy 
I cling to every verse 

Don't drive along these roads 
Cos they'll take you to a precious glade 
Where troubled minds release their pain 
And never tell a soul 

Don't hold me in your arms 
Cos I needed that more yesterday 
But I need you now and I'll not complain 
Just don't read every word 

If you feel the same 
You should let it all out now 
And if you feel the same 
Then you should let me know right now 

Inside I'm open 
I just never learnt how to get it all out 
Inside I'm all hope 
I just never learnt how to get it all out 
",Precious
Bernard Butler,"Don't hold your pain 
In the cracks in your face 
Remember those lines will reflect your whole life 
You don't look the same when your heart is tame 

What's in your hand? 
Tell me what's in your hand? 

Spare a thought for something I've been taught 
You won't get far keeping me awake 
So smile 
Just smile 

And then sing this song 
Without a care anywhere 
I will care for you in every way 
I will share every day 

Stoned despair 
Just leaves our minds unaware 
Until we sing this song 
Without a care anywhere 
I will care for your in every way 
I will share every day 
You're too smart for me to take 

Just don't despair, sugar, land is near 
Could we walk for miles without the faintest smile? 
Just smile 
Smile! 
",Smile
Bernard Butler,"Hoping I don't make somebody cry
Hoping not to live too many lies
I gave her what I could but she didn't notice what happened to me

Hoping I remember what I wanna say
Hoping that religion doesn't get in my way
I gave her everything but she didn't notice what happened to me

She'll have to wait a long time
She'll have to wait a long time
She'll have to wait a long time to comfort me

She took me to the station where she cried
She told me that my instincts were run dry
I told her everything was gonna be alright if she comforted me

She'll have to wait a long time
She'll have to wait a long time
She'll have to wait a long time to comfort me, yeah, yeah, yeah

She'll have to wait a long time
She'll have to wait a long time
She'll have to wait a long time to comfort me

So, I sing this to myself now she's not around
I sing it when and wherever I may be bound
It makes me feel so good just to hear the sound that comforts me

Songbird, you got tales to tell
How many times can you describe your living hell?

It's not so much that the thrill is gone
Just a cleaner, sweeter, brighter thrill has come along

I can sense trouble just around the bend
And it's all been my kind of making
I can't carry on with all this pretence
When it's clear that my love has been fading

There's forces that run so deep
I'm falling into the temptation
To let it wash all over me
Come and wash me clea-ea ea- ea- ean
Come and wash me clean a nervous step into the future
While the present shatters all around you
It's all moving too fast
And now the footprints of your failures
Seep into the safety of the harbor
Leave it all in a dark past

C'est toujours plus loin, toujours plus fou, toujours plus beau

Dans la jungle à la lune pleine
Les papillons ne se brûlent pas sur les lanternes
Ils montent cette nuit-là vers les hautes ténèbres
On regarde de loin briller leurs ailes bleues
On raconte ces choses dans le nord du Brésil
Il m'a semblé les voir se perdre dans les fils
Des araignées velues dévoreuses de rêve
Mais la jungle rend fou

Assis à l'ombre des mangos
Dans la taverne d'Eldorado
Les rêves d'or ont la peau dure
Comme les diamants sous le carbure
Elle me regarde et me soupèse
Il est trop tard ou bien trop tôt
Elle me questionne sans dire un mot
As-tu trouvé ce que tu cherches Gringo?
As-tu trouvé ce que tu cherches Gringo?

Vieilles légendes indiennes, rêves mystérieux des jungles
La voix grave d'une femme parle du pays des morts
Où, juste à quelques miles, brille la Cité d'Or
Ton silence affamé a décodé les signes
La nuit qui va tomber tourne ses feuilles noires
Du côté du couchant, du sang et de l'espoir
Du côté des chercheurs tombés dans les abîmes
Du côté du parfum des femmes
Mais le parfum rend fou

Le son saturé de la radio
Dans la taverne d'Eldorado
Fait hurler les hommes et les chiens
Je bois et je ne pense à rien
Je l'ai eue très vite et sans un mot
Elle ne sait pas ce que je vaux
Elle ne sait pas ce que je cherche

Bernard Lavilliers,"Nous étions jeunes et larges d'épaules,
Bandits joyeux, insolents et drôles.
On attendait que la mort nous frôle,

On the road again, again, 
On the road again, again. 

Au petit jour on quittait l'Irlande 
Et, derrière nous, s'éclairait la lande.
Il fallait bien, un jour, qu'on nous pende.

On the road again, again, 
On the road again, again. 

La mer revient toujours au rivage. 
Dans les blés mûrs, y a des fleurs sauvages.
N'y pense plus, tu es de passage.

Voyagent mal de nos jours.

Bernard Lavilliers,"Tout le gang était là, ceux de Porto-Rico, ceux de Cuba
Les maqueraux de Harlem, les revendeurs de coke ou de coca
Ceux qui vivent au soleil, avec des femmes blanches dans les villas
Et ceux qui mangent pas, sapés comme des nababs à l'Opéra
La voilà

C'est une latine de Manhattan, de la résine de macadam
Un coup de fouet, de haut en bas, qui te soulève, c'est la Salsa

C'est une frangine portoricaine qui vit dans le Spanish Harlem
Les reins cambrés au bon endroit, elle est superbe
C'est la Salsa

Une sauce mélo de te quiero mucho et de cafard
Une sauce mais là c'est le Christ qui te saigne pour vingt dollars
Une sauce mêlée de beauté, de souplesse et de conga
Une sauce lamée comme la peau de la fille qui danse pour moi

C'est une latine de Manhattan, de la résine de macadam
Un coup de fouet, de haut en bas, qui te soulève, c'est la Salsa

C'est une frangine portoricaine qui vit dans le Spanish Harlem
Les reins cambrés au bon endroit, elle est superbe
C'est la Salsa

Tout seul dans la nuit chaude, je la garde serré contre mon cœur
Malgré la mort qui rode, chuchotant quelque chose à son chauffeur
Y'en a marre des palaces, elle s'en va faire des passes pour le panard
Je la suis à la trace, ramassant ses paillettes sur le trottoir

C'est une latine de Manhattan, de la résine de macadam

Bernard Lavilliers,"Caruarú Hotel Centenario, suite princière
Vvue sur les chiottes, télé couleur, courant alternatif
Les pales du ventilateur coupent tranche à tranche
L'air épais du manioc

Le dernier texaco vient de fermer ses portes
Y a guère que les moustiques pour m'aimer de la sorte
Leurs baisers sanglants m'empêchent de dormir
Bien fait pour ma gueule ! J'aurais pas dû venir

Calé dans ton fauteuil tu écoutes ma voix
Comme un vieux charognard tu attends que je crache
La gueule jaune des caboclos, Antonio Des Morte
Capangas machos à la solde des fazendeiros

Pour te donner un avant-goût de vacances intelligentes
Ceux qui vendent du soleil à tempérament
Les cocotiers, les palaces, et le sable blanc

Ne viendront jamais par ici
Remarque il paraît que voir les plus pauvres que soi, ça rassure
Alors allez-y, ici, tout le monde peut venir, ici il n'y a rien

Un soleil ivre de rage tourne dans le ciel
Et dévore le paysage de terre et de sel
Où se découpe l'ombre de lampião
D'où viendront les cangaceiros de la libération?
Le cavalier que je croise sur son cheval roux
Son fusil en bandoulière qui tire des clous

A traversé ce désert, la sèche et la boue
Pour chercher quelques cruzeiros à Caruarú
Un éternel été émiette le sertão
Le temps s'est arrêté en plein midi
Il y a déjà longtemps

En attendant que l'enfer baisse l'abat-jour
Qu'on se penche sur ta misère du haut de la tour
Tu n'as que de la poussière pour parler d'Amour
Aveuglé par la lumière comme dans un four

Que tous les chanteurs des foires gueulent ta chanson
Même si c'est le désespoir qui donne le ton
Tu n'as pas peur de la mort, même tu l'attends
Avec ton parabellum au cœur du sertão

Un soleil ivre de rage tombe dans le ciel
Et dévore le paysage de terre et de sel
Où se découpe l'ombre de lampião
D'où viendront les cangaceiros de la libération
Sertão, sertão, sertão

Une ampoule jaune pendait au plafond
Elle me demandait avec son regard étrange

Elle a fait glisser sa bague
Autour de ses doigts et posé ses deux mains

Dans les grands salons de Leblon et d'Ipanema

Au coin de son lit et je me suis cassé
Seul, dans les chemins qui descendent vers la mer

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You
Bernard Peiffer,"They say that falling love is wonderful
It's wonderful, so they say
And with the moon up above, it's wonderful
It's wonderful, so they tell me

I can't recall who said it
I know I've never read it
I only know they tell me that love is grand, and
The thing that's known as romance
Is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say

To leave your house some morning
And without any warning, you're stopping people,
Shouting that love is grand, and
To hold a man in your arms is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say",They Say It's Wonderful
Bernard Peiffer,"You make me feel so young
You make me feel as though spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy in-div-dual

The moment that you speak 
I wanna go play hide and seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots 
Runnin' across the meadow 
Pickin' up lots of forget me nots

You make me feel so young 
You make me feel there are 
Songs to be sung 
Bells to be rung 
And a wonderful spring to be sprung
And even when I'm old and gray 
I'm gonna feel the way I do today
'Cause you make me feel so young",You Make Me Feel So Young
Bernard Peiffer,"Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,

Bernard Peiffer,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Broken, beaten, sick at heart

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""

Bernd Wurzenrainer,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?","Somewhere Over the Rainbow (for the film ""The Wizard of Oz"")"
Berndt Egarbladh,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love
