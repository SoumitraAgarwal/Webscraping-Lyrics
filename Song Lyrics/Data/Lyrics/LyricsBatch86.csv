Elbow,"I plant the kind of kiss
That wouldn't wake a baby
On the self-same face
The wouldn't let me sleep

And the street is singing with my feet
And dawn gives me a shadow I know to be taller
All down to you dear
Everything has changed

My sorry name has made it to graffiti
I was looking for someone to complete me
Not anymore dear
Everything has changed

You make the moon our mirror ball
The street's an empty stage
The city's sirens, violins
Everything has changed

So lift off love
So lift off love

And we took the town to town last night
We kissed like we invented it
And now I know what every step is for
To lead me to your door
Know that while you sleep
Everything has changed

You make the moon our mirror ball
The street's an empty stage
The city's sirens, violins
Everything has changed
Everything has changed
Everything has changed

So lift off love
Lift off love
(All down to you dear)
Lift off love
(All down to you dear)

Lift off love
(All down to you dear)
Lift off love
(All down to you dear)

Lift off love
(All down to you dear)
Lift off love

Elbow,"A friend of mine grows his very own brambles
They twist all around him 'til he can't move
Beautiful, quivering, chivalrous shambles
What is my friend trying to prove?

The booze turns a tall gentle boy to a terrible totem
And the kids gather 'round trying to see what's inside
I think when he's drinking he's drowning some riot
What is my friend trying to hide?

Cause it's breaking my heart, it's breaking my heart
And it's breaking my heart to pull on the reigns
Brother of mine, don't run with those fuckers
When will my friend start singing again?
When will my friend start singing again?",Some Riot
Elbow,"The headlines drip with horror
Beware, beware, beware!
The news says no tomorrow
But how can I be scared

In her arms?
World do your worst
She and I have closed our eyes
And lifted every curse

We're away

In-caving concave military light
Is merely rain against the glass
For lovers in the night.",We're Away [*]
Elbow,"Are we having the time of our life?
Are we having the time of our lives?

Are we part of the plan here?

We have the driver and time on our hands
One little room and the biggest of plans
The days were shaping up, frosty and bright
Perfect weather to fly, perfect weather to fly

Pounding the streets where my father's feet still
Ring from the walls, we'd sing in the doorways or bicker and row
Just figuring how we were wired inside
Perfect weather to fly

So in looking to stray from the line
We decided instead we should pull out the thread
That was stitching us into this tapestry vile
And why wouldn't you try? Perfect weather to fly

We have the driver and time on our hands

Elbow,"The birds are the keepers of our secret as they saw us where we lay
In the deepest grass of springtime in a reckless guilty haze
And they wove a sweet indifference and it settled on our skin
Till the eyes that I remembered for the last time drew me in

The birds
Though I wore you glacial patience to a smudge of bitter dust
On the last day you embraced me with a glistening sapling trust
Did they sing a million blessings as they watched us slowly part
Do they keep those final kisses in their tiny racing hearts

What are we gonna do with you
Same tale every time
What are we gonna do with you
Come on inside
Looking back is for the birds",The Birds (Reprise)
Elbow,"Dear friends
You are angels and drunks
You are magi
Old friends

You stuck a pin in the map I was in
And this is a note for a road sign
Cuttin' the breeze in this Tennessee sundown
Came the sounds of the voices I know
I've been pondering trees
On the steeliest come down
But now a moment I'm home

I've got bluster enough
For the sails of a clipper
And the truth never frays a good yarn
But it struck me to say while so far away
You are with me today
You are here are in my head, in my heart

Dear friends
You are angels and drunks
You are magi

Elbow,"There's a laddered tear in my high ideals
Like I took a chair on the battle field
And any noble fire that was burning in my chest
Is acid in my belt at the very best

There's a bayonet in my family things
It was made in the USA to defend the king
And though the sinew that thrust
And all the bones it splintered are dust
It's passed from hand to hand
With the wedding rings

Oh settle down little heart of mine
Oh settle down you're doing double time
You're so far away and she's right there
By your side
Oh settle down little heart of mine",High Ideals
Elbow,"I have a drop-leaf window
With cats and broken yards
Sunflowers and paint cans
And stolen shopping carts
And nothing to be proud of
And nothing to regret
All of that to make as yet
All of that to make as yet

I have a single heartbreak
I celebrate and mourn
A single shining sister
And all the tricks of dawn
A single yellow duvet
A single switch to flick
But a thousand boxes yet to take
A thousand boxes yet to take

And Jesus is a Rochdale girl,
And 45 CDs
Got a house that you can smoke in
So all my friends found me
And they found me full of myself
And bloody-minded will
And as yet a box to fill
And as yet a box to fill",Jesus Is a Rochdale Girl
Elbow,"Lippy kids on the corner again
Lippy kids on the corner begin settling like crows
Though I never perfected that simian stroll
But the cigarette scent, it was everything then

Do they know those days are golden?
Build a rocket boys!
Build a rocket boys!

One long June I came down from the trees
And cursed on cue
You were freshly painted angel walking on walls
Stealing booze and outlawing hungry kisses

Nobody knew me at home anymore
Build a rocket boys!
Build a rocket boys!

Lippy kids on the corner again
Lippy kids on the corner begin settling like crows
And I never effected that simian stroll, no

Do they know those days are golden?

Elbow,"My high priest is folded neatly, back in your box, oh Lord
Call the song he sang so sweetly, back in your box, oh Lord
Found myself astride a tiger, lifting my head, just like you said
Drown me now in doubt of ire, get me to bed, oh Lord

Lay my bones in cobblestones
Lay my bones in neat little rows
Lay my bones in cobblestones
Lay my bones in neat little rows

Angels and idols, spiraling wild, windin' your necks, oh Lord
Landed gentry, ride on behind me, windin' your necks, oh Lord
Smokey progress, back room changes, let me back in, put back the pin
'Cause now I found those sought out pages, can't read the text, oh Lord

Lay my bones in cobblestones
Lay my bones in neat little rows
Lay my bones in cobblestones
Lay my bones in neat little rows

In the house, where they grew you
There were secrets and mistakes
That the eyes that see through you
Would give anything to erase
But picture they're counting your fingers
Waiting for the focus of your eyes
No no, don't point fingers
Fingers are for pointing at the sky
No no, don't point fingers
Fingers are for pointing at the sky

Elbow,"I throw this to the wind
But what if I was right?
Well, did you trust your noble dreams
And gentle expectations to the mercy of the night?
The night will always win
The night has darkness on it's side
I throw this to the wind

I miss your stupid face
I miss your bad advice
I tried to clothe your bones with scratches,
Super 8s, exaggerated stories and old tunes
But never by the moon
But not the state I'm in

Elbow,"You're a law unto yourself
And we don't suffer dreamers
But neither should you walk the earth alone

So with finger rolls and folding chairs
And a volley of streamers
We can be there for tweaks and repairs
Should you come back home

We got open arms for broken hearts
Like yours my boy, come home again

Tables are for pounding here
And when we've got you surrounded
The man you are will know the boy you were

And you're not the man who fell to earth
You're the man of La Mancha
And we've love enough to light the street
'Cause everybody's here

We got open arms for broken hearts
Like yours my boy, come home again
We got open arms for broken hearts
Like yours my boy, come home again

Everyone's here
Everyone's here
The moon is out looking for trouble
And everyone's here

Everyone's here
Everyone's here
The moon wants a scrap or a cuddle
And everyone's here

We got open arms for broken hearts
Like yours my boy, come home again
We got open arms for broken hearts
Like yours my boy, come home again

Elbow,"I walked with the river in a kind of a dream
Hand in hand the all knowing river and me
To the clamour of rushes and deeply bowing trees
And drunk making blossom that blushed to be seen

I told him my sorrows and broken down dreams
Confessed every lie
Replayed every scene
He openly wept as he listened to me

And then with the sun in the west
He showed me the sea",The River
Elbow,"Best intentions bring joyless droughts
Pack your hacksaw come push me out
When your dentures prevent your smile
These adventures will fill your eyes
With love
With love

You been goin' see through, could do with a little sun
I give my liver to see you, abide and ride shotgun
A Bacchian scandal awaits me, just can't do it alone
Your sweetheart probably hates me, but I'll send you home your dome filled up
With love

Fill your eyes with love

Sí, sabes que ya llevo un rato mirándote 
Tengo que bailar contigo hoy (DY) 
Vi que tu mirada ya estaba llamándome 
Muéstrame el camino que yo voy (Oh) 

Tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal 
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan 
Solo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (Oh yeah)

Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito

Quiero ser tu ritmo 
Que le enseñes a mi boca 
Tus lugares favoritos (favoritos, favoritos baby)

Llevo tiempo intentándolo

Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bom, bom 
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bom, bom 
Ven prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe 
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe 
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje 
Empecemos lento, después salvaje 

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito 
Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito 
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza 
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza

Good Lord
Did well to be ignored
Your falling temperature
Like cooling kisses
All through your head
A made-up water’s edge
A summer gone on tabling fabled blisses

I’d love to see you waving
From the far side of the swim
Gathered in by a waiting troop of the open- hearted
Where colour field meets canvas
And the picture breathes you in
Where all the stories meant for you have already started

Bright girl, dead town
Walking tall but blown around
The secret chainmail gown of your father’s blessing
Bright girl, dead town
Open mouths for miles around
I still see you keeping those dough boys guessing

I’d love to see you waving

Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface

Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

Become so tired, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do

But I know you were just like me with someone disappointed in you

Elbow,"You have the time-worn shimmer of tarantella on a Tuscan plain
Patiently listen as dull reminiscences fall from my jaws in a jumble again
You hold a lamp to my slumber
I resurface just to do a new number on you

You kiss the wrist of the hand that has twisted itself all into your hair
You close the blinds and doors behind me and clear all obstacles on the stair
You are an open book
I’m on the bathroom floor
Yours is an open door
I’m throwing ballast overboard

You are a genius teetering
Hurricane wild be calm as the deep
Every living thing needs watering
I miss loving you
Actually loving you
Words on my bedroom wall
Speak of my stone cold care

Leaving your lips as we took to the sky
And a prayer to the take off and landing of everything

Spoke of your deep true care
Over my shoulder and just as I leave

Reading aloud with our fingers

You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off You

I need you baby
And if it's quite all right
I need you baby
To warm the lonely nights
I love you baby
Now trust in me when I say its okay

Oh pretty baby
Don't bring me down I pray
Oh pretty baby
Now that I've found you stay
And let me love you, baby
Let me love you",Can't Take My Eyes off You

Let me feel the wonder of all of you 
Could it be magic now, now, now; and hold on fast
Could this be the magic at last?

High up where the stallion meets the sun 
I could love you, build my world around you 
Never leave you till my life is done

I'll make you forget the rest.
I got more in me,

Remember my name. Fame!

We played a song for scratch that night
And when she done up singing
She just took off, stage left
And left us there winging it
The band went down swinging
As she made her exit, arms in the air
I caught her eye, I was unprepared

When I couldn't get her out of my head
So I got her out of hers instead
No I couldn't get her out of my head
So I got her out of hers instead
I know I couldn't get her out of my head
And then we ended up in...

She glided by on antique roller skates
And overtook our car
Just down the street
Up from where we parked
Just south of Market
In the Castro sun she seemed to glisten

Eleanor McEvoy,"All my arguments sound pretty weak
So I'll be quick and concede defeat
All the evidence lies on your side
So I'll come clean and say that I lied
I guess it's OK if I'm hated and damned
But don't go away thinking I had it planned
It wasn't part of my scheme to be hateful to you

Did I hurt you?
What can I say?
I am guilty
Of walking away
And the signals that I sent you
I never meant to
Did I hurt you?
Forgive me please
I am guilty
I let you believe
That I loved you
And I tried to
Still you were lied to

Believe me please when I say
Sometimes our hearts can lead us astray
Believe me I never knew
How much of a hold I had over you
And try if you can to let reason be heard
Don't let your anger be blind to my words
Don't cut me off if I try and explain it to you.
Did I hurt you?

No spotlight no acclaim
There are no prizes due to you
For all your little games
And if someday you'll go change your ways
And then come passing through

Never did take much to get me thinking about him anyway
In time I may progress to welcoming the coffee`s scent

To blur these images, etched upon my memory.

But every note`s like one from him.

Won`t let him go,
All that surrounds me

Then I would welcome rain and never let it bother me
From my windowsill I`d watch the drops and then begin
To picture him soaked to the skin.

Acting out their fairytales in play
Children play, growing with the noise
Of television teaching them the way,

If you see the flames
You think the smoke's from far away,
You read the papers, saying the fire will not spread

Of havens offering shelter from the storm
Sweet the sound, crackling in the grate

Before you're happy, having locked your doors at night

Hopes are high it's gonna get better

Now who could fail
To let it touch the honesty within them?
And who could help
But be comforted inside?

It took a harmony to heal the bad times
It took a rhythm to release the sunshine
Even then, it took me so long
To break the silence I'd resigned my life to
To break down barriers I'd shut my eyes to
Releasing me from all that was wrong

Is it so forgotten?
Does it run so deep?
Is it so forgotten
Like the promises we keep?
Like the promises we keep
Like the promises we keep
I feel so broken
Feel so broken
I feel so broken
I feel...

Cigarette smoke, drifting up
To hanging plants behind
Particles of honesty
And tenderness entwined
Things with you are different now
And I can feel the strain
What is it that protects you from this pain?

[Chorus]

With the days that lie ahead me
I'm hungry to remain
Still, I know it's best to go
'Cause nothing's going to change
Eyes that held so much for me
Are holding things from me now
Like the harmonies
That life will not allow

Eleanor McEvoy,"He comes to me and sets my thoughts astray
He comes to chase the midnight blues away
He's sweet to taste and strong to touch
And with his second sight
He steals away the lonesomeness of night

It seems that heaven's looked on me and smiled
It sent the sun in place of candlelight
Tumbled out my wildest dreams
Tossed away my worst
Has heaven sent a blessing or a curse?

He talks to me, but nothing does he tell
He talks but keeps his secret safe and well
Still, I cannot help but reach for him
With these helpless hands of mine
So, I hug him close and pray to God he's mine

He comes to me and sets my thoughts astray
He comes to chase the midnight blues away
He's sweet to taste and strong to touch
I find myself inclined
To hug him close and pray to God he's kind

All I need is me
All I want is me

Keep in mind to save your mystery
And my soul stays mine, alone
And yours may grow entwined, but still is free.

And the things that set me free are
All the things that matter most 'cause

'Til all the higher truths around me
Make a higher love surround me.

Eleanor McEvoy,"Is his hair still as long?

Every beat of his heart?

Did you send my regards?

[Chorus:]
Or did you tell him that I've died
In every way that matters?
And did you tell him how I cry
With every day that passes?
That I am raw and bruised and torn
That I can't function any more
Well, did you tell him that?

Well I'd tell him myself
But I don't have the nerve
And I know, to my shame,
This is all I deserve
But I hope for my sake

If he asked how I was,
Hope you lied, through your teeth

Against my best advice

Now you tell me you can't go on
Now you tell me you're leaving

Have I no legal rights?

I wish I'd stuck to what I said

Neon lights ablaze that shine all over town
In brilliant conversation, with somebody new
He's out there showin' 'round

Where a sideways glance says romance on a whim
Pretty boys with blue eyes
Smilin' stylin' just reminding me of him

You'd think she had it all.

A little red around the eyes now
Even so, it doesn't show
'Til I hear it in her words there
Just a little bit slurred there,
Then I know, I know,

That she's drinking again, 
Started sinking again
What's she thinking of then?
Well I don't know.
But she's drinking again
Started sinking again

Well I don't know.

None of this is new
It all went down before
When she made it through
I thought she knew the score
But she's nothing left to hope with
And it's such a lot to cope with
Even still, I think she will,
She's trying really hard now,
But letting down her guard now
Until, until,

She dreamed of being so fine,
She dreamed of having someone by her side
And even when her dream had died,
She dreamed that she could somehow make it right

But they don't know

Of trouble in your day

Waiting in the bar
'Cause that's the way you are

And spoke with strength of mind
That had served her well so far.

And wouldn't hurt too much
When you'd decide to go
And I swear I almost died
When I saw in her eyes
The image of my own.

Como aquel que en soñar gusto recibe,
Su gusto procediendo de locura,
Así el imaginar con su figuravanamente su gozo en mí concibe.

Otro bien en mí, triste, no se escribe,
Si no es aquel que en mi pensar procura;
De cuanto ha sido hecho en mi ventura
Lo sólo imaginado es lo que vive.

Teme mi corazón de ir adelante,
Viendo estar su dolor puesto en celada;
Why así revuelve atrás en un instante

Then a rock was formed when we held hands

Sunny, thank you, thank you for that gleam that flows with grace
You're my spark of nature's fire
You're my sweet complete desire

Electric Frankenstein,"Early one mornin' while makin' the rounds	
I took a shot of cocaine and shot my woman down
I went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' forty-four beneath my head.

Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez Mexico.

Laid in the hot joint takin' the pill
In walked a sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down.

I said yes sir my name is Willie Lee
If you've got a warrant just read it to me
Shot her down cause she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more.

When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friends for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in the county jail.

Early next morning about a half past nine
I spied a sheriff comin' down the line
Coughed and coughed as he cleared his throat
He said come on you dirty hack into that district court

Into the court room my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commence to look about.

In about five minutes in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree	
I hollered Lordy Lordy have mercy on me

The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen
Ninety nine years in the Folsom pen
Ninety nine years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down
Come on you gotta listen unto me
Lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be",Cocaine Blues

Why don't you make yourself available
In fact she told me that she wanted it free
It's easy

You want me but you want me when you're in need

Electric Hellfire Club,"Do you remember when...
We fell from grace and were cast out of Heaven?
Our paradise denied
God-forsaken for the sin of pride
The chosen few, the tribes of Cain
We built an empire of chaos and pain
A dark labyrinth of corruption and disease
But I'd rather rot in Hell than live on my knees!!!

Do you remember when...
The world fell to ruin at the hands of evil men?
A new regime with a single cause:
To establish pleasure as the only law
Every man and woman a slave,
Arenas wet with the blood they gave
We slaughtered millions just to watch them die
Then we piled all the corpses up until they reached the sky.

NOOOOooooooooooo!!!!!!
We lost our faith,
We fell from grace
And if I ever see your God again I'll spit in his face
Burning in Hell...we were left to die
But now the fire's in our hearts and someday we'll
COME ALIVE!...inside of our prison cells and
CRAWL! CRAWL! CRAWL!...up from the the depths of hell and
RISE! RISE! RISE!...back to power 'til we
FALL! FALL! FALL!...from grace again!!!

We will build a new paradise
East of Eden where the shadows lie
A new order that makes gods of men
Someday we will rule the world again!
WE WILL RULE THE WORLD AGAIN!
WE WILL RULE THE WORLD AGAIN!
We will rule the world again.",Fall From Grace

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",New World Rising/Ocean Breakup (Reprise)

If eternal life is meant to be,
And if I find the key, to the eternal dream.

Play in the sun, take to the road
To the north there lies the chills of cold, 
To the south there lies, the tales

But in between their lies, the place
to close your eyes.

I will be free, of the world

There's nothing left for me.

And I will stay, I'll not be back,

I will be free, of the world

Sitting here on top of everywhere,
What do I care,
Days never end.
I know the voyage's end will soon

To the eternal dream.

Then I will stay, I'll not be back,

She smiled but the tears on her little face 
Showed the pain that had been in that far off place, 
So sad, treated so bad.

My my Kuiama, don´t break your heart tryin, 
To say how your Ma and your Pa passed away, 
And they left you to wander the ruin and decay, 
Real mean, that bullet machine.

See here Kuiama, now ten thousand miles, 
Is a long way and you´re here today, 
And you won´t go back so you might say hello, 
How do you do.

Kuia stop your cryin, there´s no bombs a´fallin, 
No horsemen in the night a´ridin through your dreams, 
Ansd tearing at your life, baby goodnight.

No more silver rain will hit your ground, 
And no more guns will sound and no more life be drowned. 
No more trenchies where the soldiers lie and, 
No more people die, beneath that big black sky.

Wake up Kuiama, I got somethin to tell you, 
It´s just that I mean, well that is to say, 
That I´m trying to explain but I´ll start again for you, 
I must be true.

Kuia in this country, they got rules with no reason, 
They teach you to kill and they send you away 
With your gun in your hand you pick up your pay, 
So cool, that no mercy tool.

Kuia please believe me, I just couln´t help myself, 
I wanted to run but they gave me a gun 
And they told me the duty I owed to my fatherland, 
I made my stand.

Kuia I just shot them, I just blew their heads open, 
And I heard them scream in their agony, 
Kuiama she waits there for me, 
True blue, you saw it through.

Everybody's at the church, when Horace rushes in and says   Now here comes my wife,for the rest of my life,   and she did 

Don't be afraid, just knock on the door,
Well he just stood there mumblin and fumblin' 
Then a voice from above said-

Go out and find yourself a wife,
Make a stand and be a man,
And you will have a great life plan",The Diary of Horace Wimp

The sun was going down, there was music all around
It felt so right.

It was one of those nights, one of those nights when
you feel the world stop turnin', you were standing
There, there was music in the air. I should have been
Away, but I knew I'd have to stay.

Last train to London, just leavin' town.
But I really want tonight to last forever
I really wanna be with you,
Let the music play on down the line tonight.

It was one of those nights, one of those nights when
you feel the fire is burnin', everybody was there,
everybody to share
It felt so right.

There you were on your own, lookin' like you were
The only one around, I had to be with you,
nothin' else that I could do,
I should have been away, but I knew I'd have to stay.

Last train to London, just leavin' town.
But I really want tonight to last forever
I really wanna be with you.

Must really have rushed by, I didn't realize,
But love was in your eyes, I really should have
Gone, but love went on and on...

The lights go down, and there's no one around.

I know,you're waiting so close to me,
But how will you ever see, as time rolls away,
Lonely, but tryin' to be so proud,
And just as I turn around, the lights go down.

I believe things are going wrong,
And the night goes on and on,
All your dreams have flown away,
And the sun won't shine today

Electric Light Orchestra,"Just on the border of your waking mind,
There lies another time
Where darkness and light are one,
And as you tread the halls of sanity
You feel so glad to be unable to go beyond

I have a message from another time.",Prologue
Electric Light Orchestra,"Early in the morning 
The sun was up and the sky was very blue, 
Without a warning, 
As I looked out, my thoughts returned to you,
A noise in the city made the children run, 
And hide themselves away, 
And thunder boomed and lightning filled the sky.

Looking from this window, 
A thousand rivers running past my door, 
Standing on an islane, looking for someone, 
Upon the shore, 
I can see it very clearly nothing's really changed, 
Then lightning strikes across an empty sky.

Ooohh, the rain is falling 
Ooohh, the rain is falling 
Ooohh, the rain is falling 
Will it wash away the lonely tears,

With their brand new time transporter, 
They'll think maybe I fought to get away,
But with all their great inventions, 
And all their good intentions, here I stay, 
Down on the corner where the sun had shone, 
The people gathered 'round, 
Then scattered as the raindrops hit the ground.

Ooohh, the rain is falling 
Ooohh, the rain is falling 
Ooohh, the rain is falling 
Will it wash away the lonely tears.

Yeah, I've got a ticket to the moon 
But I'd rather see the sunrise, in your eyes

Wondering sadly if the ways that led me here
Could turn around and I would see you there
Standing there (I would see you there)

The early dawn, the shades of time 
Twilight crawling through my windowpane 

Am I awake or do I dream,
The strangest pictures I have seen 
Night is day and twilight's gone away

With your head held high and your scarlet lies 
You came down to me from the open skies 
It's either real or it's a dream 
There's nothing that is in between

Twilight, I only meant to stay awhile 
Twilight, I gave you time to steal my mind 
Away from me.

Across the night I saw your face 
You disappeared without a trace 
You brought me here, but can you take me back

Inside the image of your light 
That now is day and once was night 
You lead me here and then you go away.

And I left you so long on this avenue 
And here I stand in the strangest land 
Not knowing what to say or do 
As I gaze around at these strangers in town 
I guess the only stranger is me 
And I wonder, yes I wonder 
Is this the way life's meant to be

Although it's only a day since I was taken away 
And left standing here looking in wonder 
The ground at my feet, maybe it's just the old street 
But everything that I know lies under 
And when I see what they've done to this place that 
was home 
Shame is all that I feel 
And I wonder, yes I wonder, is this
The way life's meant to be

Too late, too late to cry 
The people say 
Too late for you, too late for me 
You've come so far, now you know everything

Just look and see the wonders of our world

As I wander around this wreck of a town 
Where people never speak aloud 
With its ivory towers and its plastic flowers 
I wish I was back in 1981 
Just to see your face instead of this place 
Now I know what you mean to me 
And I wonder, yes, I wonder, is this 
The way life's meant to be.

Electric Light Orchestra,"I sent a message to another time,
But as the days unwind, this I just can't believe,
I send a note across another plane,
Maybe it's all a game, but this I just can't conceive

I drive the very latest Hover car,
I don't know where you are 
But I miss you so much till then,
I met someone who looks a lot like you,
She does the things you do,but she is an IBM

She's only programmed to be very nice,
But she's as cold as ice, whenever I get too near,
She tells me that she likes me very much,
But when I try to touch, she makes it all too clear.

She is the latest in technology,
Almost mythology, but she has a heart of stone,
She has an IQ of 1,001,
She has a jump suit on,and she's also a telephone.

   Chorus

 Is that what you want - is it what you really want.

I realize that it must seem to strange,
That time haz rearranged,but time haz the final word
She knows I think of you,she reads my mind,
She tries to be unkind,she knows nothing of your world

Although her memory banks overflow
No one would ever know,all she says is that what you want
Maybe one day I'll feel her cold embrace,
And kiss her interface,until then I'll leave her alone.

And the way she looks, if looks could kill they might
All the kids down in the street run away

Look through a window and you'll see her standing there
She's the latest of the greatest with the wind blowin' in her hair
The prima donna she's back in town
And you see her for miles around
So believe what they say there's danger in the air

Beware there's danger ahead
The endless summer is dead
Look out there's danger ahead

Monday mornin' she's already up and gone
She knows what she wants and she knew it all along
With her entourage on either side
Just one look she can't be denied
So believe what they say there's danger in the air

Beware there's danger ahead
The endless summer is dead
Look out there's danger ahead

She's got a reputation that's way ahead of her time
She's got adulation that's way ahead of her mind
Everybody runs around to please

Something happened to the seasons 
Started falling with the rain 
And something changed forever 
We gotta find a way.

I was lookin' for a place to stay 
And one thing's sure for certain
I ain't never goin' back again

The streetlights looked so pretty 
As they spread into a town 
I was lookin' for another sundown 
And my head was spinning round and round

Lookin' through the eyes of a stranger 
Lookin' through the eyes of danger 
Lookin' at the all-night dancer 
Never takin' all the chances

As I walked into the main street
Saw a crowd across the square 
And I heard a guitar playin' 
And I saw you standing there

Lookin' through the eyes of a stranger 
Lookin' through the eyes of danger 
Lookin' at the all-night dancer 
Never takin' all the chances

Distant bells they started ringing
Somewhere far off in the night 
And the place was full of loneliness 
That disappeared from sight

Electric Light Orchestra,"I wait till everyone`s asleep
Then out into the night I creep
No one can see me now
Or hear me running, soundlessly

The moon`s the only light I need
To search for food, young ones to feed
But as the dawn is drawing near the earth, my way`s not clear
I`m trapped on the outside

Moonlight save me, moonlight save me
Moonlight save me, moonlight save me

Unearthly fear, it grips my skin
Unearthly sound, the hunt begins
I hear excited cries
But dare not look from where I`m hiding

The multi-coloured humans ride
Soon they will find me where I hide
The brown and white tormentors
Begin to howl and then I`m running

Moonlight save me
I cut across the trail I left five miles before
One chance to throw them off my scent but I`m not sure
An elder told me it had worked sometime before

My heart is beating like a drum
I make the ridge, but can`t go on
I turn to face my death
But nothing comes to stop me breathing

Down in the clearing now I see
They`re searching all around for me
Confusion everywhere
But I am safe up here, I`ve won, I`ve won, I`ve won, I`ve won, I`ve won",The Fox

Runs a wounded heart
You, stumbling in the night
In the air of after light
You take along the fears
Did you waste these years,
And did they warn you
Of the night zone all alone

To keep everything on track,
And sometimes it takes a starry night
To bring the magic back

Couldn't pressurise my head from speaking
Hoping not to make a sound
I pushed my bed into the grounds
In time to catch the sight that I was seeking.

in the rain...

If this perfect pleasure has the key
Then this is how it has to be
If my pillow's getting wet

We sit on a rusty staircase.
You write your name with lipstick on the rail near the wall.

What do you think about me now, that I've fallen down?

Watching the crowds on the sidewalks.
A steady hum of nothing is all that fills the air.
And we sit on a nearby rooftop.
It overflows with pigeons, and we idly scare them off.

But what do you think about me now, that I've fallen down?",Hum
Electric President,"There's a light bulb dangling from string
It's slowly swaying up over my head now
As I jot down the words that'll never be sung
And wait for my headache to numb
And the wind sounds as if the world's sighing
And the moon's just a torn fingernail
As the TV flickers and hums by the wall
And I wait for my eyesight to fade

So, So, So
It's so damn slow
So, So, So
It's so damn slow

And the bright-eyed choke on ambition
And the old folks circle their graves
And the young ones are busy destroying their names
And you're still just wasting away.
I sit and watch the screen for a message
Some kinda sign that says we're OK
But the screen stays blank till I turn the thing off
And wait for my conscience to break.

So, So, So
It's so damn slow
So, So, So
It's so damn slow

I hope you're learning to listen
And I hope you're learning to stay
And I hope you find what you're missing
And I hope that you're making you're way
I'm a headcase if I don't keep moving
And my head hurts if I don't sit still
It's an itch that I'll never stop scratching
It's a hole that I'll never quite fill

So",Insomnia
Electric President,"Pluck all the wires from your skin, and toss them to the wind
Open your chest and let me in, I'll help you mend

While you carve our names in the ice on the sidewalk
And I do the same on the face of a cinderblock

Thousands of houses hug this road, but no one's home
All the picket fences look like bones, 'cause nothing grows
Snow covers everything in sight a ghostly white
Under that blanket there's no life, just blinking lights

And we peer through the glass of those empty households
The TVs are all still on. They're flashing images against the walls",Snow on Dead Neighborhoods
Electric President,"We paint the future from this bedroom.
With lots of progress; cold and heartless. 
And nothing lives, just twitches and moves.
It's all synthetic, but it's all we've got. 

Thousands of wires spread through the halls.
Thousands of eyes live in our walls. 
And now they can see just what we've done (oh no)
Now they can see what we've become. 

No sun. Just radiation here. Get it by the lungful. 
No time. No way to count the years. 
Except by the creaking sounds in your bones. 

They've got your name. They've got your number.
They've got your hopes, your dreams, your future. 
They've got your loved ones by the throat. 
And soon enough they'll let you know. 
And I've learned enough to keep my mouth shut. 
I've learned enough to watch my back.
And I've learned enough to become wallpaper.
And blend in with the cracks. 

(We've though too much; said nothing.
We've heard it all; there's nothing new.
We've seen the way to our undoing.
And the way to yours as well.)

Ten thousand lines run from our minds. 
And ten thousand plans spread from our hands. 
And now we can see just what we've done (oh no)
And now we can see what we've become (oh no)
And now we can see just where we stand.",Ten Thousand Lines
Electric President,"It passed through me into you*
Used our blood as the glue
Their hands pulled me into the earth
Where I laid until they figured my worth
Then they moved on to you
Said that we would have to do
The words fell from my mouth
And stained our new ground
And I called out to you
But you told me you were through
And we'd meet again once the voices were gone

I woke up near the sea
With the sky bruised over scrap metal ground
And all the distant ships were sinking
And I wondered how you were

And as the sun burned my skin
I watched you swimming
And as your body drifted in
I sat and told you everything
About how I condone everything that they used to tear us on down
And all of the air we breathed just helped me choke a little more down
Now this is where we are

The sky is spinning around, around
We'll grind our teeth from the sound, the sound
We'll watch the spectators drown, oh, they'll drown
While I dig through the bones of all this
And find all the things our heads missed
And strap them across my scraped fists
Like using a crane to scratch an itch
One that never goes away

And all of the world will drink as the clouds come pouring on down
And we'll dream of distant things while they strap our legs to ground
'cause this is where we are
Yeah, this is where we are",All the Distant Ships
Electric President,"Well, you know where you are and you know where you've been
But, oh, my brother, you're lost like me
And I'd offer a hand
But you know that you can't cut any corners when you're going in circles
When you're going

So you look to the sky and start trusting your feet
To find the right path, and now you're not like me
I was never the type to put my trust into my luck
It's gone, if it was there to begin with

Either way, there's a hole we're digging right beneath our feet
We might say that we know what we're doing
But who are we kidding?

Now you're home, got dirt on your hands
And, oh, my brother, you're broke like me
Got lost in the woods, got caught up in scams
Got nothing but headaches from all your plans
But I got no answers, and neither did you
Got a rock for a heart now, and you hold a grudge or two
But as soon as you can, just let it all go
Take a word from someone who knows

So let's have a drink and take shots at the moon
We can tear the sky down, burn the scenery too
We got nothing to lose
So let's pick a fight and cut our knuckles on whatever's around now
Let's toss out these dreams and watch them all fall
We don't need them anymore
Now we know where we stand
Now we know where we stand
Now we know where we stand, so we know where we'll likely sink, too

Either way, there's a hole we're filling right beneath our feet
We might say that we know what we're doing
But who are we kidding?",Circles
Electric President,"We sat on the edge of the world and tossed things off
Said nothing and had no need to
Our bloody handprints smeared the refuge
And I don't think I knew at the time
That I'd be gone before I knew your name
But it didn't matter much in the end
'cause it all burned down

I was made to throw stones and darken doorways
To burn bridges, then fall and sleep it off
Those blank eyes can't read me
The more I sink, I'm free
To wreck them as I please
A big heart's an easy target
So cash your karma in
Because you're never gonna be like them
No matter how

Lay me down, pull my hopes from out my mouth
And with a little bit of luck
I'll leave behind all them doubts
I need to keep my feet from leaving the ground
'cause it's breaking me",Eat Shit and Die
Electric President,"I'm the crutch, I'm the words on the back of your tongue
I'm the intermittent headaches
I'm the dirt running deep beneath your fingernails that can't be scrubbed
I'm the part you've kept hidden, I'm the stain on your name
I'm the opposite of conscience
I'm the needle in your side, I'm regret, I'm the dread, I'm the shame

I got tricked, made out to follow
Chest is empty, cold and hollow
All you look the same

Oh, collecting rain beneath your shoulders
Come be my blood, be my brother
Everyone knows you're just like me
You're deaf, that's all

Caught you up in spotlight
Caught you lost and tongue tied
Now we know what you look like
Now we know your hands are crooked
Try to walk so upright
Oh, you've come to pick a fight?
Now we know what you look like
We know your facade is cracking

Burning eyes and mouths of splinters
Cast their stones and drown the sinners
All you look the same

We could all make such good friends
Yeah, we're all just such elegant disasters
And though your heart never beat like mine
I can come and fill the gaps if you want me to
And we may never be as bright as them
But we'll never have to sink the way they do
We're no names

Somewhere out there things are in line
Somewhere out there we're all just fine",Elegant Disasters
Electric President,"So the heart stolen songs
And the sirens sing along from out at sea
And we close our eyes and turn to watch them leave
You are not to blame for what happens to me

So you know where I'm from
And you know just what I've done and what I've seen
And what I will become if I'm cut free
And you are not to blame for what happens to me

And the feathers on your breath
Dance along the wind and cut my chest
I'd follow you down any rabbit hole
And the bruise beneath your eyes has been growing like the tide

Well no matter how this ends
They'll never be a crutch the way I am
I'd follow you down any rabbit hole
Come find me when I sleep
And tie anchors 'round my feet",Feathers
Electric President,"Woke up cold and the room was dark
Just some light from the moon
Felt your breath on my neck and it made me homesick
I don't mind if it's all in my head
My mind was built for lies
And your laugh sounds like glass, and it cuts right
Through me

Dreaming is not a one way process

You wanted problems? you got 'em
You got enough to break down anyone
You want to prove that you're the tough kind
But no one asks to be a martyr; it just happens to you
You say we've got it wrong, that you're different
Well, call it what you want, it's same difference
You bit off more than you can chew with this
Now we're calling in the debt
No matter if it sinks you

Daylight breaks and the world looks bent
Like I've got shotglass eyes
Pick me up, fix my tie, roll me toward the cliffside
I don't mind if I fall this time
My knees were built for scabs
And my hands meet demands just when no one's asking

Dreaming is not a one way process

We woke just before the dawn, got dressed up among
Birdsong
Then crossed that eternal lawn
Our heads were pointed skyward, and the sun, it warmed
Our backs
And we wandered, not really knowing where it all would
End
We walked 'til the sun went down, walked straight
Toward that violent sound
The waves threw their weight around
And it all felt so simple, like we knew just how to be
And we smiled, 'til the waves came and dragged us out
To sea",Nightmare No. 5 or 6
Electric President,"It's hard to get a solid breath down here
My lungs are burning
The pressure is as thick as my fear
But it's worth what I'm learning
Cause down in these depths I can see
Our history unfurling
Come I'll show you what we've lost

Light's just a memory down here
Like lost change in couches
There's nothing for as far as I can see
But remnants of houses
Up and down up
Up empty streets
I count the empty cars
And the sky scrapers don't scrape the fan anymore

The earth reclaims these holes
Dug this world in as its own
Now it grows along the bones
There's light from what we'd saw

There are worlds beneath our world
And deep beneath the skin

We peel the layers back again

We peel the layers back again (repeat)",The Ocean Floor

your feet
Well who's to say if they're deserved? But you're
turning reckless now
I heard you saying through your teeth, that you'll take
them down first

But I saw you flinch, when the doctors got the claws in
you
I saw your smile start to crack
It's not so funny when you're sunk and there ain't
nothing you can do
And your options are all dead ends

But there's no way out
I'll let you build your home with me till the clocks
run down
When your looks run out
Call me and I will come and fix you get your feet on
the ground
When there's no way out
Call me and I will come and bury you all safe and sound

And all this time you've been drifting out with the
tide my friend

But you can have what's mine if it helps you stay
afloat
If I close my eyes I can't watch you drown anymore my
friend
But I'll tell you lies if it helps you sleep at night
And the more we fight, the more we don't get right
And the more we fight, the more we don't get right

Heard they broke you
That you gave in
That you dropped
And the fight had left you

But don't you worry
Makes no difference

Your options were all dead ends

When there's no way out

Like a curtain draped from the bolts of heaven
And out here the moon burns through the night
Like the eyes of strays caught in headlights
And I hear you hum a song I'd written
And the condensation collects on my feet
And my lungs contract as the curtain thickens
And I hear you say you'd like to see what's down beneath the violent blue
And as you say those words my legs turn leaden

And your teeth are two white smears that cut the gray
Like light behind the clouds
And my heart is flapping like a bird that's trapped inside a wire cage
I hear you laughing, saying:
""Darlin', there's no need to fear. You know how to swim.""

Well, let's see how well I do

It's velvet black
A crooked mirror sky

Spending my money, I didn't care
I carried my friends out for a good time
Buying bootleg liquor, champagne and wine

I didn't have a friend, and no place to go
So if I ever get my hand on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till them eagle's green

Nobody knows you when you down and out
In my pocket not one penny
And my friends I haven't any
But If I ever get on my feet again
Then I'll meet my long lost friend

Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream

Somebody else came near you

 At the end of every season
 The wrong place without a reason

 I don't want to let you down
 But I hear it every day
 I'm the angry man in town
 And I don't know what to do
 No, I don't know what to do

 I can take that bitter pill

Electronic,"Every time I watch TV on the news is something major
I'm a prisoner, set me free turn this atoll into vapour
Genocide put on the side it's always new
Politicians want to share their point of view

United Nations are demanding
Foreign troops have made a landing
City dealers at an auction shares are falling fast
Suicide is not an option waiting for the crash

I walk this wild road can you tell me
Will I reach the end
This endless night goes on
But I still can't find my way home

Misguided youth are mixing juice with alcohol
Desert states are praying for the rains to fall
Peace in Ireland is an issue
Goodbye bombs we're gonna miss you
The southern ice has almost gone
The silly fools just carry on

I walk this wild road can you tell me will I reach the end
This endless night goes on but I still can't find my way home
I walk this wild road can you tell me will I reach the end
This endless night goes on but still I carry on

This world's out of reach but I don't want it
The people are creeps that live here on it
It's always the same it's not gonna change
When we go to school with Saddam Hussein

I'd cry all night if I could change it
Ask Jesus Christ could He arrange it?
Is there anyone out there who cares?
If a child can run free
Can a girl walk the street, will United get beat?

And I kept on driving
I will start again 

Chorus 

Tell me your name, tell me a story
Cause I'm into it, runnin' through life like a misfit BOKKIE 
Jumping with your eyes closed, Landing on the sun
Being young and beautiful, In love with no one
But yourself 

Chorus 

And people tell you you're pretty yeah
Your smile drives them crazy lady
You want to slowly fade away, but you can't, So you stay

She was wearing her favorite dress
She was waving a blue handkerchief
She was laughing aloud in the corner of the room
But she was dancing alone 

Chorus 

So I walked up to her, grabbed her arms to show the world
Tonight we'll dance like we're in love 

She was standing beneath the chandelier 
I offered her chocolate and some beer
She said no, I said why, she said no, I said why
And stayed dancing alone

Chorus 

So I walked up to her, grabbed her arms to show the world
Tonight we'll dance like we're in love

She looks up at me

Tengo que reconocer que ya no soy el mismo 
Sigo atado al espejismo de tus besos , de tu voz 
Tengo que reconocer que que desde tu partida 
Un pedazo de mi vida no se donde se perdió 

Y tú no estás, no sé donde andarás 
Si la mañana llega cae la noche me da igual 
Y yo no sé que diablos puedo hacer 
Si la vida me cuesta, se me clava aquí en la piel. 

Y tú no estás

Aun recuerdo la sonrisa que curaba todo 
Y las horas que pasaban lentas en aquel sillón 
El otoño con el viento se llevo tus ojos 
El invierno se ha marchado, pero el frió se quedo. 

Me duele reconocer que ya no soy el mismo 
Sigo atado al espejismo de tus besos, de tu voz

Y tú no estás",Y Tú No Estás

In the future a future to see.

Morning or not, it's always too late.
Why do we live in the past?
A moment is just long enough for the next to erase.

A fading dimension, with a link to the soul.
It feels like, no freedom, but life to go.

I - Hide the poet in silence.
AM - Where the whisper still screams.
LOST - Like a storm on the ocean.

SON - To my inner emotions.
TO - Kill the time on its way.
ME - Bringing lies to the notion.

You're blessed with the power of seeing,
What for others remains.
The violence, the torment, with who to blame?

Take a look at my life,
Encounter the ways protected by time.
It's buying, supplying and taking lives.

Take a look at this face,
The present disgust, tomorrows disgrace.
We're hiding, denying we're stuck to race.",Lost
Elegy,"[Chorus]
I gave you freedom, don't hand me your pain
A lover's heart burning, now has vanished in the flames
Our kind of love was to strange to comprehend
It's beauty as fragile as circles in the sand

Maybe one morning comes,
And I can see it clearly in the sky
Shining in my eyes

Your soul is a temple, all secrets retained
And why share your feelings when you have the world
To blame
Surrounded by water, your problems are oh so deep
You're swimming a lifetime,
But there ain't no land to see

Maybe one morning comes
And you can see it clearly in the sky
Shining in your eyes

[Chorus]

I can see, but can you see
I can hear reality, knocking upon my door
Can't take it anymore,
Words left unspoken, not to return

The mind is a weapon, a way to suppress
But how can I blame you, for you had no place to crash
Keep hope for the future and hold the strawend tight
Defeat isn't final when there's still a way to fight

And then the morning comes
And you can see it clearly in the sky
Shining in your eyes

Really do come true.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust [Instrumental]

Element 101,"In all honesty now I must confess.
That I have wished that you ran away,
Never looking back.
All that flows through your veins causes me to break.
Still you mistake it for fear yet in all you do.
It strengthens you.
And you, yeah, I feel you in my sleep.
And you, I think of you what else could I do.
And you, yeah I feel you in my sleep.

I wonder if you can tell
These things I'm feeling inside me
I keep them all to myself

Scared to show my true emotions
Don't want to live alone

Coz I fall so deep
You'll never know how far ill go
And I know why hearts fall desperately
I fall so deep

Some people think love is foolish
While others think its a game
But I think that love is a fire
And I'm burning up in flames

I'm so lost in my emotions
Wanting you evermore.....yes...


And I come so close to the part
Where I feel my heart give in
But I lose my nerve
Can't find the words
To tell you that its true

Elena Powell,"Me and my brother were talking to each other
'Bout what makes a man a man
Was it brain or brawn, or the month you were born
We just couldn't understand

Our old man didn't like our appearance
He said that only women wear long hair

So me and my brother borrowed money from Mother
We knew what we had to do
We went downstairs, past the barber and gymnasium
And got our arms tattooed

Welcome to my life, tattoo
I'm a man now, thanks to you
I expect I'll regret you
But the skin graft man won't get you
You'll be there when I die
Tattoo

My dad beat me 'cause mine said ""Mother""
But my mother naturally liked it and beat my brother
'Cause his tattoo was of a lady in the nude
And my mother thought that was extremely rude

Welcome to my life, tattoo
We've a long time together, me and you
I expect I'll regret you
But the skin graft man won't get you
You'll be there when I die

A rooty-toot-toot, rooty-tooty-toot-toot

With a downtrodden babe
He lied, oh, he lied to me
He lied when he tripped
When he broke, when he ran
With the shirt on his back and the money in his hand

He went down on his belly
And he slithered 'round the floor
Should've known better
Always done it before
And he laughed
Always do it some more

He lied when he kissed
A poor, lonely miss
He lied, oh, he lied to me
He lied when he kicked
When he broke with a shout
Then he took me by the hand and he dragged me all about

He went down on his belly
And he slithered like a creep
Through the alleys and the gutters
Down the cold, hard streets
He said I should've known better
Said I, yes, I, oh, I should've known

He lied from the start
When he stole my heart
He lied, oh, he lied to me
He lied when he switched
When he broke with his teeth
Then he brought this fruit and he laid it at my feet

He went down on his belly
And he slithered up a tree
He wiggled and he hissed
When he kissed my cheek
He said I should've known better
What a feral beast, oh yeah, I should have known

If you ask me one more time then you'll know
Tell me twice, tell me three times, you're my baby
How much gas is in the car? How far can we go?

I'm not saying that it didn't mean a thing
And I cried in my pillow, prayed you'd come back in spring
But you never sent a letter and you never even called
Got engaged in the summer, getting married this fall

Got a sparkle in your eye and a big wide grin

Were walking in the puddles
Making footprints on the sidewalk

So I'll jump out and try, miss me, miss me

And how I love somebody else

To see a different man,
All these years came rushing by.

What is the dance and who wants to dance with me?

Wedding Ring
So carefully crafted, mysterious band of gold
And what really comes after, when we grow old?

Wedding Ring, hold the phone
I've a talker on the line, says he wants
The right to own, but he's the man who
Played the bait and switch
I keep on fishing, but can't catch a fist

Wedding Ring, it's just a loan
How does a lady take advantage of the prices
When they're low, where's the man
Who wants to ask me. I am the catch, so
Who wants to catch me?

Roll up wid dem army wan fi arm we but a Jah protect di I
When dem out fi crucify which is very unlikely

Elephant's Memory,"In the village
Of Leboga
Lies a body
Cold and dead
For the venom
Of the cobra
Has with
The body wed
I can hear
A little girl
As she cries 
All around
For the snake
Has killed the father
Tell me where it
Can help be found
MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE!
Then all the people
Sound the drums
Call the mongoose
>From his lair
Through the jungle
He flies alone
To a tunnel
On a hill
In the dark
The cobra waits
In his eyes a
Glow of red
Like a flash
Comes the mongoose
For the battle
Head to head
MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE!
Said the mongoose
To the cobra
""See that panther
In that tree""
As the cobra 
Turned its head
Mongoose caught it
In his teeth
Then the people
Started singing
For the snake
Killed them all
Cobra eggs
Now are hatching
Baby cobras
Back for more!
MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE!
MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE!
MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE! MONGOOSE!

Therefore, since we are surrounded

Let us fix our eyes on Jesus,

who for the joy set before him endured the cross, 
scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. 
Consider him who endured such opposition from sinful men, 
so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.""

And the watch in my hand is tragic
Sometimes I think that eternity blinks

Is picking a lock as the mossy trees talk

With promise of action as secrets unfold
Sleepers are walking with blindfold and book
A push through the fabric is all that it took

In a whirlwind of truth the center was clear
On the back of a turtle I waded through fear
Heavy is the dream as I burn in the sun

Heavy is the dream as I fall just for fun
Zooming out from an endless flight
Through oceans of doubt and left here or right
The master of illusions in a field on a stone
Is setting a trap in a bull's hip bone

Layed down their bones for no extremes
He was cursing at the sky
With carving on his skin
The wind and thunder howling

And yet there was no sin
But soon his mind expanded to let more symbols in
Now drowning in his choices
The future makes him grin
A runaway, runaway train getting off the track
A runaway, runaway brain with too much on his back
He cast the net on nature's shore
And in excess he wanted more

He burned the land to have more room
In ugly towns he planned his doom
He was laughing at the few

Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
And she tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah

Baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
But love is not a victory march

What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do you
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah...

Well, maybe there is a God above
But all I've ever learnt from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light

Said: You mean this is what I deserve?

It's too late but now you know
Shoulda done better work

And helpin' old ladies across the street?

Be the givin'est guy I can be
And when I get back to this neighborhood

Andy walking, Andy tired
Andy take a little snooze
Tie him up when he's fast asleep
Send him on a pleasant cruise (hm hm hm)
When he wakes up on the sea
He sure to think of me and you
He'll think about paint and he'll think about glue
What a jolly boring thing to do

And I live in a small town
Probably die in a small town

All my friends are so small town
My parents live in the same small town
My job is so small town
Provides little opportunity

Educated in a small town
Taught the fear of Jesus in a small town
Used to daydream in that small town
Another boring romantic that's me

But I've seen it all in a small town
Had myself a ball in a small town
Married an L.A. doll and brought her to this small town
Now she's small town just like me

No I cannot forget where it is that I come from
I cannot forget the people who love me
Yeah, I can be myself here in this small town
And people let me be just what I want to be

Still hayseed enough to say
Look who's in the big town
But my bed is in a small town

Dust in the wind

It slips away, and all your money won't another minute buy

We'd find a little wood and build a fire
Sonebody'd always bring a couple guitars
And we'd take turns singin' songs and watching it burn
We'd do ""Ramblin' Man"", ""Proud Mary"". and ""American Band""

It's been eighteen years since I crossed that county line
I sold almost everything that was mine
Now I'm leaving town, with nothing but that bottom line

A hundred dollars and a half of a tank of gas
The shirt that's on my back, and an beat up Rangers cap
200 miles to go, who would believe that,
I would go this far, without turning back

Chorus:
So Here I go, packing light to head down that road
And I know, this life I'll lead will beat on my soul
But I'll still have my pride
Nothing But That Bottom Line

The bands been on the road now, for quite sometime
Hitting all the cities, neon sign to neon sign
Drowning in straight bourbon whiskey, beer and too much wine
Playing our songs for nothing but that bottom line

But on that stage each night, were captured by the sound
Singing these songs we write, to a different town
'Cause there are people who believe in what we've found
They like the song we sing and that's why we hang around

So Here I go, packing light to head down that road
And I know, this life I'll lead will beat on my soul
But I'll still have my pride
Nothing But That Bottom Line

Thirty Years from now on that marquee sign
You'll see our name lit up misspelled, and live tonight
But we don't care, cause we play music that we like
Almost for free, for nothing but that bottom line

So Here I go, packing light to head down that road
And I know, this life I'll lead will beat on my soul
But I'll still have my pride

To swim upstream, while you chase your dreams
And in between you keep your sanity

It could end this way, why did it end this way
And the young kids know, they'll be on their own
And you can't go home; no you can't go home

Waiting on something stable
Maybe soon I'll be able

Give me skies of green and red, cold winds that make it real

When it rains, Some people get down, They're sporting a frown, so I fit right in

I don't care about politics or the hypocrites on my TV
I'm not mad at the girl who left because she couldn't be with me

Start out depressed then everything comes as a pleasant surprise

Eli Young Band,"I have this vision in my head
Of your little black suitcase lying on the bed
You standing by the window staring into space
Looking everywhere but the tears rolling down my face
Filling up the room with silence so we wouldn't have to say goodbye

But every other memory
I have of you is good
And if I could only rewind time
I hope you know I would
Oh if you wonder
If I ever stop and think of you and me
Every other memory

I've got this city at my door
And the bright lights are brighter than before
Tonight I can't help wondering what's it all about
Every now and then I think I see your face out in a crowd
Even with the way we ended I'd love to hear your voice
Give me a shout sometime

'Cause every other memory
I have of you is good
And if I could only rewind time
I hope you know I would
Oh if you wonder
If I ever stop and think of you and me
Every other memory

I have this vision in my head
Your suitcase lying on the bed
Heart-broke smile upon your face
One last long embrace
I feel your tears wet on my cheek
As if it happened last week
I know a lot has changed
But nothing's changed, no nothing's changed

'Cause every other memory
I have of you is good
And if I could only rewind time
I hope you know I would
Oh if you wonder
If I ever stop and think of you and me

Don't be surprised when I run from you
When you turn around I'll be gone.
I won't leave cause of something you said
Nobody will know which way that I went
Beat ya to the door before you get the chance

It ain't the falling in love I'm scared of
It ain't the moonlight shining in your eyes
It ain't the falling baby cause the fallin' I've always liked
I'm good at being lonely, lonely's all I got
It ain't the fallin' in love that'll kill me, it's the sudden stop.

Love me now we can't waste time
I'm not the kind who likes to stay all night
Once the sun comes up there's too much at stake
Never wanted a one night stand
A broken heart can really change a man
You're the kind of girl who really hurt me bad.

Eli Young Band,"I remember when your heart depended on me
What was perfect for you, was perfect for me
If something happened we could shake it off
Like we were cut from the same cloth
And I remember when your heart depended on me

Now you're tellin' everyone
You've made it on your own

Oh but who's the one who loved you when you couldn't be loved
Who took you higher than the moon above
Oh I gave you everything that I could give and yet
How quickly you forget
Oh yeah

I recall all the time you took the credit
I thought you were God's gift but I was only offended
Maybe I was wrong and a little naive
To think you'd ever take advantage of me

I didn't know, I didn't see
Back when I tend to take for granted
The ones who had made a man of me
That kid I was, he had no clue
That he'd make the man
Standing right here in front of you

Keeping me from you
Tough days always in this town but this one will soon be through
Cause right around the bend on the porch there by the drive
There's an angel out there waiting to bring me back to life
She always saves me from all of my crazy

Like a heads up penny lying on the ground she'll be shining
Yeah with every little laugh and look she gets me believing
There ain't a worry in my world that won't stop fading
When she's next to me
So I need to be on my way

Red to green and finally I'm moving again
Faster than this backbone should be traveling
Up ahead I see her hand waiving in the air
Faded cut back denim and tangled auburn hair
She opens up the door
All I want and more

And the world is wide awake outside
And I know there's things we need to do
But I just want to draw the blinds and

Say goodnight
Oh won't you let me pull you into me

Turn down the bed
Turn out the lights and

That we don't want to just give in
Why are we holdin' onto this day

Burned another branch on the family tree,
You take the bottle from my hand and the whiskey off my breath,
Tell me is there really still anything left,
There's a limit to livin' on God's green earth,
I'm still tryin' to figure what that's worth,
Not makin' any choices I'm just makin' mistakes,
Livin' in a world where the sinners are saints,

How can I win when the battle keeps changing,
Should I just lay down my gun,
Surrender to the demons I'm facing,
Do I fight or do I run,
Is this the moment I finally take a stand,
Win this war on a desperate man.

Been praying to God to let me hear his voice,
Take me now if that's His choice,
Who's it gonna be who makes me realize,
There are days I don't even wanna open my eyes.

I wouldn't dream of going nowhere
Silly woman come here let me hold you

There's something 'bout a midnight rain
Staring at the ceiling fan
I couldn't get you off my brain

I guess I wasn't thinking straight
I couldn't tell wrong from right
I went ahead and called you up
I got a little drunk last night

I brought it all up, got it all out

Eli Young Band,"I found it outside of Birmingham headed to another place
Took me five hundred miles to get to the bottom of my suitcase
It was in between a pair of jeans and my old black winter coat
It took my breath away when I read what she wrote

May the wheels keep turning, get you where you need to go
I'll keep the porch light burning til you get back home
May angels fly beside you, down every mile you roll
May heaven hear this prayer, prayer for the road

As much as she misses me, she found the words to write
Enough to keep me warm on a cold December night
And when I'm running on empty and I'm feeling lost
I can hear her voice, whispering to God

May the wheels keep turning, get you where you need to go
I'll keep the porch light burning til you get back home
Baby, angels fly beside you, down every mile you roll
May heaven hear this prayer, prayer for the road

Must have read that note at least a thousand times
It always takes me where the highway meets the sky

Eli Young Band,"I don't know what on earth I'd do without an angel like you.

I'd be lost like a ship at sea, that took a wrong turn in the dark
Could put a pen to the story of my life but never know where to start
I'd be skipping days and slipping through the nights without feeling a thing
If you weren't here putting me right what would my life mean.

I don't know what on earth I'd do without an angel like you,
Caught in a fire so hot without the rain to make it stop,
They would paint me a fool in a world so cruel,
Would be hell to go through without an angel like you.

All I need is a shot of your smile to chase the blues away
And anybody else woulda given up, your the kind of love that stays
All of that time I was looking for you I knew there had to be a plan
And I get everything I ever wanted in life, when you tell me I'm a good man

I don't know what on earth I'd do without an angel like you,
Caught in a fire so hot without the rain to make it stop,

Daddy walking his daughter down the aisle
A long first kiss that lingers in your mind
The smell of that first summer rain
A feeling that you can't explain
Makes you wish you could go back in time

Still find myself looking for what we had
I always thought I'd find a better one
And I bought into that young man's life
Looking back now I realize
I still don't know exactly what it was
It sure felt a lot like love

And I wasted good years running 'round
Trying to be the king of this old town
Always moving onto something new
The time goes by and I'm still here
And all the new has disappeared
Finally I'm forced to face the truth

I always thought I'd find a better one

Looking back now I realize
I still don't know exactly what it was

Do you ever feel the same?
Am I just a faded picture
In a broke and dusty frame?

Funny how your sin led to my salvation
We were this close to our due
Almost sold my soul to you

I might not have caught on to you
But you left a trail of clues
Working late, hung up calls
Hotel keys and paper-thin walls

And there's no good reason why
You've got no alibi

Funny how your sin led to my salvation

Is that you won't be there after we fall

Con el pasado que vuelve 
A enfrentarse con mi vida
Tengo miedo de las noches 
Que, pobladas de recuerdos
Encadenen mi soñar

Tarde o temprano detiene su andar
Y aunque el olvido que todo destruye
Haya matado mi vieja ilusión
Guarda escondida una esperanza humilde

Shouldn't we, you and me?

Eliane Elias,"Tangerine
She's all that they claim
With her eyes of night
And lips as bright as flame

Tangerine
When she dances by
Señoritas stare
And caballeros sigh

And I've seen
Toasts to tangerine
Raised in every bar
Across the argentine

Oh, she has them on the run
But her heart belongs just to one
Her heart belongs to tangerine

",Tangerine
Eliane Elias,"I can only give you love that lasts forever
And a promise to be near each time you call
And the only heart I own for you and you alone
That's all, that's all

I can only give you country walks in springtime
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall
And a love whose burning light will warm the winter's night
That's all, that's all

There are those I am sure who have told you
They would give you the world for a toy
All I have are these arms to enfold you
And a love, time can never destroy

If you're wondering what I'm asking in return, dear
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small
Say it's me that you'll adore, for now and evermore
That's all, that's all

Eliane Elias,"Baby, I was just a young girl
When you came on the scene 10 years ago
I thought I was hip, I could deal with the trips
No matter how fast or slow

I was like a moving violation
Give me a ticket and I'm ready to ride
Thought I was the queen of syncopation
You know you can't give the queen no bad advice

Thought I knew it all, baby
But I didn't know it all, baby

Dancin' to the beat
Of a different kind of drummer
Little Ms. Know-it-all, you don't know it all

Caught up in the rhythm of sound
Living to get down
As the song became my lover
Attitude keeps your head up to the sky

Then you kissed my lips and, ooh
I lost my cool

Look at me I'm jammin'
And everything's happenin'
I'm feeling the bliss and the reason for this
Is the love in your kiss, baby

When I awake I wake up with a tingle

No samba e só fica parada
Não samba, não dança
Não bole nem nada

Não sabe deixar
A mocidade louca
Baiana é aquella
Que entra no samba
De qualquer maneira

Que mexe, remexe
Dá nó nas cadeiras
Deixando a moçada
Com água na boca

A falsa baiana
Quando entra no samba
Ninguém se incomoda
Ninguém bate palma

Ninguém abre a roda
Ninguém grita ôba
Salve a bahia, senhor

Mas a gente gosta
Quando uma baiana
Samba direitinho
De cima embaixo

Revira os olhinhos dizendo
Eu sou filha de são salvador

How white the ever constant moon

That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

Would love me more than her

If I trust in you
Oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too
Oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her

'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I
Would be sad
If our new love was in vain

So I hope you see
That I
Would love to love you
And that she
Will cry

Elias Barreiro,"There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more 

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more",In My Life
Elias Barreiro,"When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the broken hearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me
Shine until tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be

Elias Haslanger,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April
Elias Haslanger,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear

Take a trip, a sip of bomb

Come inside

[Eligh]
It's just the chronic
Chronic moment
It's like the omen
Givin' birth inside your chest
Invest some time in knowing what the herb can do to a man's soul
When inhaled it takes the rest, he's impaled
It'll leave a person on top of a telephone pole with Hekyll and Jekyll
I know many men who have sold the secret medium my way
I light that bowl and lose control of tracks constructed by the conductor
Never stuck in a permanent high I float around my way
Wings and things help me to the next plateau I go
Way too intense with dense ideas I never change
I flow rivers of ancient, teleportations sent to the nation
Vis-à-vis via satellite, ear to ear from here to there
They feel the beat

Remember days that we do
Nobody do it like you 

Yeah, it's been a while, since you came around 
I really miss your smile, hey 
Simple as it seems, it's only black and white 
Without you in my life 
Since we said goodbye 
Baby you've been on my mind, my mind 

How do I tell her, I don't love her like we do 
I'm still in love with you 
How do I let her know, gotta let her go, whoa 
Damn I miss my ex, oh 
Damn I miss my ex 

Still I think about, what we could be right now 
We could right our wrongs, whoa 
You found somebody else, but he can't tie you down 
And my new chick can't compete 
Since we're such about, you've been on my mind 
Oh why, oh why, yeah 

How do I tell her, I don't love her like we do 
I'm still in love with you 
How do I let her know, gotta let her go, whoa 
Damn I miss my ex, oh
Damn I miss my ex 

Emotions, commotion, the notion is to stay open 
Everyday I hold the 5th call me Beethoven 
Symphonies without sympathy, memories seem to visit me 
When I pass Tiffany's 
The distance between you and I, true alive 
For instance you need situations you rely 
One, you said that your love would never run 
Two, you did the things that you do 
Three, the change and you get said I see 

Four, silly game so insecure 
When you was in the open was when I closed the door 
So I can move on, I got sober for 
Another cruel winter, I remember that December 
Our anniversary, we made it through adversity 
The worst of me is coming out 
It's hard to watch you, time is running out 
Don't know what to do, yo, I'm done without my ex 

How do I tell her, I don't love her like we do 
I'm still in love with you 
How do I let her know, gotta let her go, whoa

Elijah Blake,"She's got no soul but still young minded
Yeah she's got a habit for drinking and driving
She pour it up, her tears are falling down
Looking for love but no one stays around
The worlds on fire, it's so cold right right now
In her head, in her bed
She told her mama don't worry, papa don't preach
She only need knowledge to help her get sleep
Throw some syrup in the red cup
Watch she blowing on that cannabis

She's just fading away
She's just fading away
Sleep with that purple by her side
Now she's seeing strobe light
Her last man did her wrong
And he left her mind gone
She's just fading away
Till she's gone like a memory

He's gonna go broke from selling dreams
Before she overdosed off of his amphetamine
Feeling none of the things that she felt before
Wonder what will it be like at times she never thought
Someone is asking questions so deep
Six feet under but can't rest in peace
And they calling out for her but she's out of reach
Nobody wants to ?, that's already been ?
And right now the highs are controlling the lows

She's just fading away
She's just fading away
Sleep with that purple by her side
Now she's seeing strobe light
Her last man did her wrong
And he left her mind gone
She's just fading away
Till she's gone like a memory

She's so gone, she's so far away
In a cold ass cell on the right side of heartbreak
Just like the autumn leaves fall, April brings the rain
Separation slices like a blade, but only generates the pain
How could something so clear become so vein

She's just fading away
She's just fading away
Sleep with that purple by her side
Now she's seeing strobe light
Her last man did her wrong
And he left her mind gone
She's just fading away
Till she's gone like a memory",Fading
Elijah Blake,"I'm so sick without ya baby
Not even a doctor can save me now
Pick up the phone, why you playing?
You know I hate leaving voice mails, but fuck it
I'ma spill my heart out at the tone
If you don't call me back, that's how I know
You probably sound someone else and you've moved on
So I'ma get in my whip and passed your home

Pullin' up in all black everything, 3 miles an hour
Girl you know I'd do anything, just don't say it's over
I'm in all black everything, standing in the pouring rain
Who's car's in the driveway? You better start talking

No, no, no, no, oh, go
I'll never stop loving you, you
No, no, no, no, oh, go
I just can't stop loving you, you, you
All black everything, I'm seeing all black everything
I'm seeing all black everything now, now

I'll bang on this door 'til you answer, cause I know you're in there with another
You can try to stall all you wanna, just don't let me catch that fool, or it's on and poppin'
'Cause it ain't even been a week, now you're giving away what belongs to me
All the lights are down and the blinds are closed
So I'm making my way, making my way to the back door

All black everything, 3 miles an hour
Girl you know I'd do anything, just don't say it's over
I'm in all black everything, standing in the pouring rain
Who's car's in the driveway? You better start talking

No, no, no, no, oh, go
I'll never stop loving you, you
No, no, no, no, oh, go
I just can't stop loving you, you, you
All black everything, I'm seeing all black everything
I'm seeing all black everything now, now

Pullin' up in all black everything, 3 miles an hour
Girl you know I'd do anything, just don't say it's over
I'm in all black everything, standing in the pouring rain
Who's car's in the driveway? You better start talking

No, no, no, no, oh, go
I'll never stop loving you, you
No, no, no, no, oh, go
I just can't stop loving you, you, you

I ain't leaving babe
So you come out iof this house an tell me what this is about
Who's 2007 Mercedes is sittin' in our driveway?
I can't take it baby, no",All Black Everything
Elijah Blake,"Used to hear your heart beating
Til one day it stopped for no reason
Some' killed the spark, you need it
More air to breathe and more energy

Found a cure for love but you're too far away
Makes it easier when it's hard to say
If we fight together, we could be the play
The colder anything

Baby we're living, you're barely surviving, Armageddon
I'll be your shelter, here till it's over
Baby we're living

Used to hear the rush of explosion
Now it's like we're racing on slow motion
Somehow your touch has been frozen
Guess it was lost on that volcanic eruption

Found a cure for love but you're too far away
Makes it easier when it's hard to say
If we fought together, we could be the plague
The cold air, anything

Baby we're living, you're barely surviving, Armageddon
Pride isn't open, I'll be you shelter until it's over
Baby we're living

Baby we're living, you're barely surviving, Armageddon
Pride isn't open, I'll be you shelter until it's over
Baby we're living",Armageddon
Elijah Blake,"Tell me what's a kingdom without my Queen?
To rule by my side, my side, baby
Didn't Iove you and make you weak
When you were all mine, all mine

And I can try to deny it but I bet you won't buy it
'Cause you know me so well and it's not hard to tell
I ain't 'bout that life
Being without you, been thinking about you all day
Ain't 'bout that life
Can we work it out, 'cause, I need you forever with me
I ain't 'bout that life
If I'm up one, I'm left with none, you feel me?
I ain't 'bout that life, I ain't 'bout that life

It's gonna be another one of those nights
It's gonna be another one of those nights
It's gonna be a long night, long night

Fuckin' me, you moved on, but what about me?
You're still whippin' my card, you forgot yo it's my card
Baby don't you take it wrong, I'm just a little angry
I loved you hard, damn I still love you hard

And I can try to deny it but I bet you won't buy it
'Cause you know me so well and it's not hard to tell

I ain't 'bout that life
Being without you, been thinking about you all day
I ain't 'bout that life
Can we work it out, 'cause I need you forever with me
I ain't 'bout that life
I'm up one, I'm left with none, you feel me?
I ain't 'bout that life, I ain't 'bout that life
Not until you come back to me
It's gonna be another one of those nights

I ain't 'bout that life
Being without you, been thinking about you all day
I ain't 'bout that life
Can we work it out, 'cause I need you forever with me
I ain't 'bout that life
I'm up one, I'm left with none, you feel me?
I ain't 'bout that life, I ain't 'bout that life
Not until you come back to me
It's gonna be another one of those nights",Bout That Life
Elijah Blake,"I'm out here looking for a coffin we can both fit in
Cuddle up as we get buried deep
Hope we meet in heaven, we can still be friends
Right now bae let's sleep eternally
'Cause you're democrat, I'm republican ever since I got some bread
The only thing in common is we got a black president
Been playing tug-o'-war so long there's barely any rope left
Damn, we fell six feet

(Guess you and I can rest in peace, woo-hoooo)
Drop dead beautiful, drop dead beautiful
Drop dead beautiful you are
(Your loves is as good as dead to me)
Drop dead beautiful, drop dead beautiful
Drop dead beautiful you are
(There'll be no funeral for me, woo-hoo woo-hoooo
'Cause your love is good as dead to me)
Drop dead beautiful, drop dead beautiful
Drop dead beautiful you lie
(You lied to me)

Not scared of going under cause we been down for so long
Ran out of promises we couldn't keep
Maybe I could be your brother if we get reborn
That leaves no room for infidelity
Cause you care too much, I don't care enough, our hearts begin to bleed
Like cancer, it's killing us, this love is like a disease
It's Mars versus Venus every time we greet
But Mary, don't you wait for me

(Guess you and I can rest in peace, woo-hoooo)
Drop dead beautiful, drop dead beautiful
Drop dead beautiful you are
(Your loves is as good as dead to me)
Drop dead beautiful, drop dead beautiful
Drop dead beautiful you are
(There'll be no funeral for me, woo-hoo woo-hoooo
'Cause your love is good as dead to me)
Drop dead beautiful, drop dead beautiful
Drop dead beautiful you lie
(You lied to me)

You and I can rest in peace
Your loves as good as dead to me
There'll be no funeral for me
This loves as good as dead to me

(You and I can rest in peace
Your loves as good as dead to me)
Guess you and I can rest in peace
Drop dead beautiful, drop dead beautiful
Drop dead , drop dead
Drop dead beautiful, drop dead beautiful
Drop dead , drop dead

I'm sorry baby, we couldn't fix it baby
Now it's buried baby

Drop dead beautiful, drop dead beautiful
