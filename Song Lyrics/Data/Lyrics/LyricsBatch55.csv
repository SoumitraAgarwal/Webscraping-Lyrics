Derek Trucks,"There comes a time, 
In each man's life,
To find your way,
Or fall behind

Who you are,
Is the path you take, 
And I'll find my way ,
Through your mistake

Sometimes your tears,
Are your bridge to the sky,
But you can't trust souls,
With no truth in their eyes

Who you are,
Is the path you take,
And I'll find my way,
Through your mistake

Time will heal,
And all we know,
If nothing's learned, 
Baby, nothing grows

Time will heal,
And all we know,
Everything stays the same,
Nothing changes, 
Nothing changes

A man's not a man,
When he takes the lower road,
Dragging his tail,
To cover his tracks

When you plant the seeds,
Of doubt in my mind,
You know you run the risk,
Of being left behind

When I turn the mirror,
I turn it back on myself,
I can see your way,
Was a cry for help

Time will heal, 
And all we know,
If nothing's learned,
Baby, nothing grows

Time will heal,
For all we know,
Everything stays the same,
Nothing changes,
Nothing changes",I'll Find My Way
Derek Trucks,"People, this is just a dream away
I see us walking to a better day
Gonna be alright when tomorrow comes
After the heat of the revolution

One world forever
One world, I see
One world forever and ever
It's alright with me

Daylight comes like a wonder drug
You've got to live for what you love
Gonna be alright when tomorrow comes
After the heat of the revolution

One world forever
One world, I see
One world forever and ever
The revolution, it's alright with me, yeah
The revolution, it is alright, oh, it's alright with me

One world forever
One world, I see
One world forever and ever
The revolution, it's alright, yeah, it's alright with me
It's alright with me, yeah

One world forever and ever
It's alright with me

Derek Trucks,"Sad, sad lover being true
Falling out a window for the view
All of us laugh, how many of us say?
This sky where we live is no place to lose your way
So love, love, love

Lose your body and your mind
And the bitter taste of time
All of us cry while we should be dancing
This sky where we live is no place to lose your way
So love, love, love

Fly, fly away, fly away
Fly fly away, do you remember?
All of us sleeping, how many of us dream?
This sky where we live is the place to lose your way
So love, love, love

Fly, fly away, fly away
Fly, fly away, do you remember?

Derek Trucks,"Don't you know I got to find me a home
Right now in your heart

I'll travel over miles and down the highways, babe
Through the valleys every byway
Just to find me a home right now in your heart

I'll bring you to the music, refueling
Everything you want to
Everything you need babe
Just to have me a home right now in your heart

Baby I'll travel for you over miles and
Through the valley babe
Down all the highways
Through the valleys honey

I gotta, gotta, gotta have it baby
Gotta find me a home
I've got to have a big beautiful home
Somewhere in your heart",Home in Your Heart
Derek Webb,"Like a man comes to an altar, I came into this town
With the world upon my shoulders, and promises passed down
And I went into the water, my father, he was pleased
I built it and I'll tear it down so you will be set free

I found thieves and salesmen living in my father's house
I know how they got in here and I know how to get 'em out
I'm turning this place over, from floor to balcony
And then, just like these doves and sheep, you will be set free

I have always been a lover, from before I drew a breath
Some things I loved easy, and some I loved to death
You see love's no politician, because it listens carefully
So of those who come, I can't lose one, so you will be set free
Oh, you will be set free

Go on and take my picture, go on and make me up
I'll still be your defender, and you'll be my missing son
And I'll send out an army, just to bring you back to me
Cause regardless of your brother's lies, you will be set free

I am my beloved's, and my beloved's mine
You bring all your history, I'll bring the bread and wine
We'll have us a party, where all the drinks are on me
And as surely as the rising sun, you will be set free
Oh, you will be set free",Lover
Derek Webb,"I've got the dress, I've got the ring
I've got a song that I can sing
I've got the bread, I've got the wine
But I've got the life I've left behind
I've got everything, but I've got nothing
Without you

I've got the law on my heart
I've got your love tearing me apart
I've got a vow that I can't keep
But I've got your promise getting me to sleep
I've got everything, but I've got nothing
Without you

I've got your works, I've got my faith
I've got all the wine that you can make
I am the kiss of your betrayer
But I've got your grace on every layer
I've got everything, but I've got nothing
Without you

'cause you see it's all just a show
You either hate it or you don't
And only time will tell the difference
If you get it clearly or with interference

I've got the race, got the election
But win or lose, I've got protection
I found a lobbyist in the devil
But I got salvation in a rebel
I've got everything, but I've got nothing
Without you",Nothing (Without You)
Derek Webb,"Mercy speaks by Jesus' blood
Hear and sing, ye sons of God
Justice satisfied indeed
Christ has full atonement made

Jesus' blood speaks loud and sweet
Here all deity can meet
And without a jarring voice
Welcome Zion to rejoice

All her debts were cast on me
And she must and shall go free

Peace of conscience, peace with God
We obtain through Jesus' blood
Jesus' blood speaks solid rest
We believe and we are blessed

All her debts were cast on me
And she must and shall go free

Should the law against her roar
Jesus' blood still speaks with power

All her debts were cast on me
And she must and shall go free

All her debts were cast on me
And she must and shall go free
",She Must and Shall Go Free
Derek Webb,"If you could love me as a wife.
For my wedding gift your life.
Should that be all I ever need?
Is there more I'm looking for?
Should I read between the lines?
Look for blessings in the skies?
Make me handsome rich and white.
Is that really what you want?
 
'Cause I am a whore I do confess.
I put you on just like a wedding dress, 
And I run down the aisle,
Run down the aisle.
I am a prodigal with no way home.
I put you on just like a ring of gold,
And I run down the aisle, 
Run down the aisle, to you.

Could you love this bastard child?
No, I don't trust you to provide.
With one hand in a pot of gold
And the other in your side.
'Cause I am so easily satisfied.
With the call of a lover's soul as wild.
I would take a little cash 
Over your very flesh and blood.
 
'Cause I am a whore I do confess.
I put you on just like a wedding dress, 
And I run down the aisle,
Run down the aisle.
I am a prodigal with no way home.
I put you on just like a ring of gold 
And I run down the aisle, 
Run down the aisle, to you.

'Cause money cannot buy 
A husbnd's jealous eye.,
When you have knowingly 
Deceived his wife.

'Cause I am a whore I do confess.
I put you on just like a wedding dress, 
And I run down the aisle,
Run down the aisle.
I am a prodigal with no way home.

Derek Webb,"I'm robbing peter, i'm paying paul
I'm changing my name back to saul
I got to them and you know i'll get to you

i'm turning shepherds into sheep
And leaders into celebrities
It's holy sabotage, just look around you

‘cause everything's for sale in the 21st century
And the check is in the mail from the 21st century

don't want the song I want a jingle
I love you Lord but don't hear a single
And the truth is nearly impossible to rhyme

but I know the songs with all the hooks
And I know some lies that will sell some books
So grab ‘em fast, i'm running outta time

just keep selling truth in candy bars
On billboards and backs of cars
Truth without context, my favorite of all my crimes


What works verses what's right
Hey what's the difference tonight?

take out the sign, forget the meal
We've got a gym and a farris wheel
I swear it's just like the country club down the block

‘cause you can make your life look good
You can do what Jesus would
But you'd be surprised what you can do with a hard heart


I think you've got trouble in the 21st century
So welcome to the struggle, it's the 21st century
I never thought i'd make it to the 21st century
Lord, I love the 21st century

I write these words from the grave
‘cause it's the only place that i'm safe
And only the dead are permitted to speak the truth",Ballad in Plain Red
Derek Webb,"You ravished me with one look of your eyes
You, you are fair, you're so fair, oh my love
Better than wine is your love
If you can't find me it's alright, oh my love
Stay with your friends, I will come speak to you
'Cause you are mine, oh my love
And better than wine is your love

Better than wine is your love, is your love
Better than wine is your love, is your love

You are beautiful, eyes like doves, oh my love
You have lips like jewels, hair of gold, oh my love
Wild as a vine is your love
But better than wine is your love

I tell you, my beloved
You cannot be replaced
With my left hand beneath your head
And my right arm around your waist
So I take a deep breath
Because I feel a little drunk
But I'm in my right mind babe
And I know your love is much",Better Than Wine
Derek Webb,"I repent, I repent of my pursuit of America's dream
I repent, I repent of living like I deserve anything
Of my house, my fence, my kids, my wife
In our suburb where we're safe and white
I am wrong and of these things I repent

I repent, I repent of parading my liberty
I repent, I repent of paying for what I get for free
And for the way I believe that I am living right
By trading sins for others that are easier to hide
I am wrong and of these things I repent

I repent judging by a law that even I can't keep
Of wearing righteousness like a disguise
To see through the planks in my own eyes

I repent, I repent of trading truth for false unity
I repent, I repent of confusing peace and idolatry
By caring more of what they think than what I know of what we need
By domesticating you until you look just like me
I am wrong and of these things I repent",I Repent
Derek Webb,"I've got faith in the bank and money in my heart
I've got a calloused place where your ring used to be, my love

I've traded naked and unashamed
For a better place to hide
For a righteous mask, a suit of fig leaves and lies

I thought the cattle on a thousand hills
Was not enough to pay my bills
And I fell in love with those who proved me wrong
And now I want a broken heart

Now there's a great pad lock
On the place where I was free
And I'm feeling bad from swallowing that key
Now I work real hard but I mostly call in sick
Of a broken back from the ground fighting back at me

I cannot look you in the eye
So I check the knots on my disguise
'Cause I fell in love with fashion in the dark
And now I want a broken heart

I've got alibis for every crime
A substitute to do my time
'Cause Your heart breaks enough on both our parts
So now I want a broken heart
Now I want a broken heart
Now I want a broken heart",I Want a Broken Heart
Derek Webb,"Don't lie to me
Tell me something true
'cause I'm only free
When I look at you

and you look so good it hurts
And love, I come undone

but I don't want medication
Just give me liberation
Even if it cuts my legs right out from underneath
Don't give me medication
I want the real sensation
Even when living feels just like death to me

don't paint my face
I need to see the scars
So I don't forget
The back of my tutor's arm

'cause I just can't keep it straight
Which kills and which one saves


‘cause the truth is I need you just like the air I breathe
Just like a freight train needs the tracks beneath
So i'd rather suffer my whole life and be this rich man's wife
If loving you means suffering",Medication
Derek Webb,"She's not real, she's the spokes on a wheel
But the way she moves will take you where you wanna go
And you're the one that she steals from
But if not you she's gonna find somebody else

‘cause nothing is ever enough

and you love her but you know you've got to leave her
‘cause she's leaving you with no way out

she's a jewel in the nose of a fool
She's beautiful but she don't know who she is
And you're a wreck because you suspect
That she'll never be who she was years ago

‘cause nothing is ever enough


Maybe you don't see it
But she's waiting everywhere you're gonna go
In the faces of the people who look at you
Like someone that they know",Nothing Is Ever Enough
Derek Webb,"I know I always let everybody down
I know I've got a bad name in this town
'Cause my last friend stopped calling months ago

I know I always make you wait around
I know the way my promises must sound
And even though you've heard it all before
Darlin' could you listen just once more

I've got a reputation with everyone
But I don't want one with you

I know you know me well enough by now
And you're loving me as well as you know how
But I need one more chance to let you down
'Cause no one else will give it to me now

With you, I'm so glad to get into 
A bad situation 'cause nothing makes us close
Nothing like a little incarceration",Reputation
Derek Webb,"They'll know us by the t-shirts that we wear
They'll know us by the way we point and stare
At anyone whose sin looks worse than ours
Who cannot hide the scars of this curse that we all bare

they'll know us by our picket lines and signs
They'll know us by the pride we hide behind
Like anyone on earth is living right
And isn't that why Jesus died
Not to make us think we're right

when love, love, love
Is what we should be known for
Love, love, love
It's the how and it's the why
We live and breathe and we die

they'll know us by reasons we divide
And how we can't seem to unify
Because we've gotta sing songs a certain style
Or we'll walk right down that aisle
And just leave ‘em all behind

they'll know us by the billboards that we make
Just turning God's words to cheap clichés
Says “what part of murder don't you understand?”
But we hate our fellow man
And point a finger at his grave

they'll know us by the t-shirts that we wear
They'll know us by the way we point and stare
Telling ‘em their sins are worse than ours
Thinking we can hide our scars
Beneath these t-shirts that we wear",T-Shirts (What We Should Be Known For)
Derek Webb,"As you came to us so we come to you
Fragile as a baby hopeful and new
But learning fast that to walk is to fall
Soon we've done it all

we come broken and we come undone
We come trying hard to love everyone
But we come up short in all that we do
Because we do
So we come to you

as you came to us so we come to you
Dirty and hurting then dead in the tomb
But raised redeemed to show off the scars
‘cause you've brought us this far


You came to show the way not around but through
So through it all we come to you",We Come to You
Derek Webb,"I don't want to be right anymore
I don't want to be good
I don't want to change your mind
To feel it like I do

I don't wanna sell graves

A little something to ease your mind
And prepare you for what's in store

I don't want to fight
Brother I'm not joking about peace
We can have it here tonight
It all comes down to you and me

You never asked me to save anyone

Like I was some kind of Holy Ghost
Come to change their hearts

I don't want to fight
Brother I'm not joking about peace
We can have it here tonight
It all comes down to you and me

But just between me and you

I do what I'm taught
And I've been learning a lot
About the violence I'm capable of

Before I hurt someone
'Cause I'm facing enemies
On both sides of the gun",I Don't Want to Fight
Derek Webb,"People love you the most for the things you hate.
And hate you for loving the things you can't keep straight.
People judge you on a curve 
And tell you you're getting what you deserve
And this too shall be made right.

Children cannot learn, when children cannot eat
Stack them like lumber when children cannot sleep
Children dream of wishing wells, 
Who's waters quench all the fires of hell
And this too shall be made right.

The earth and the sky and the sea are all holding their breath
Wars and abuses have nature growing with death
You say we're just trying to stay alive
It looks so much more like a way to die.
And this too shall be made right.

Yes there's a time for peace, there is a time for war
There's a time to forgive and a time to settle the score
A time for babies to lose their lives 
A time for hunger and genocide.
And this too shall be made right.

Oh I don't know the sufferings of people outside my front door.
And I join the oppressors of those I choose to ignore.
I'm trading comfort for human life
And that's not just murder, it's suicide.
And this too shall be made right.

O this too shall be made right.",This Too Shall Be Made Right

Derek Webb,"I was killed in a shopping cart
Turned upside-down and left for dead
I saw a cloud try to speak me
As I floated overhead

I found my way to a familiar place
I swear I'd been sometime before
I would've thought it was the marketplace
But I could not find the door

Oh, I have been to heaven
And I have walked the streets
But I couldn't find a hand to hold
To keep my on my feet

So paradise is a parking lot
A spot up front is your reward
And all the rest walk down streets of gold
To the house they could afford

Well I got lost in the swelling crowd
And I could not afford to eat
You only have what you came in with
So I'm living on the streets

Oh, I have been to heaven
And I found no relief
'Cause I couldn't find a hand to hold
To keep my on my feet

Well I heard Jesus Christ was there
He had a car that's bullet-proof
And that way everyone was safe
From the Man who tells the truth

Oh, I have been to heaven
And I have walked the streets
But I couldn't find a hand to hold

No I couldn't find a hand to hold

Derek Webb,"Now I can buy the proverbial gun
And shoot the proverbial child
When my uncle looks me in the eye
And speaks of freedom
My conscience goes up on trial
In the courtrooms of the mind
Where the judges all have sons
And all the lawyers all were dead
And the backs are all broke
And the bailiff is my brother
And the witness is my sister
And I'm guilty as hell
And by the afternoon I'm out
On the pavement walking
Reeking of salt and blood
No hair upon my head
No shoes upon my feet
Picking your body from my teeth
No stars above me
No stripes upon me

Free (x10)
",The Proverbial Gun
Derek Webb,"Oh, I was free to live and love and kill as I saw fit
I was at peace, I really was, no one I was at war with
The only common good was that we understood that laws unjust were only good for breaking
That difference legalized instead of sameness left nobody free
But that was the day before I married my conscience to the state

My taxes paid these road we laid to places of my choosing
There were no eyes up in the skies looking down into my bed
There was no government without our consent
And keys were made for anyone who just claimed it
And glass was all of every wall that framed it from sea to shining sea
But that was the day before I married my conscience to the state

Right and wrong were written on my heart and not just in the laws that condemned me
But now with Caesar satisfied I can even do the things that should offend me

If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

The lights are turned way down low

How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight

I guess it all just had to be.

I can't see nobody, no, I can't see nobody. 
Mine eyes can only look at you, you.

Don't ask me why, little girl. 
I love you and that's all I can say. 
You're ev'ry ,ev'ry breath I take.
You are my nights; my night and day.

Every single word you hear
Is coming from this heart of mine.

And now as I try to forget you
It doesn't work out any way. 
I loved you such a long time ago
But in my eyes you'll always be.

  This is a message, a message to y'all
  Together we stand divided we fall
  Black is a color just like white
  Tell me how can a color determine whether
  You're wrong or right
  We all have our faults yes we do
  So look in your mirror
  What do you see, two eyes a nose and a
  Mouth just like me
  Oh your eyes are open but you refuse to see
  The laws of society were made for both
  You and me
  Because of my color I struggle to be free
  Sticks and stones may break my bones

It's takin' more than he thought he could give it

That never will let him give up
And with a fire in his eyes, he dances with thunder
Till one day his day finally comes

His heart beats fast with anticipation
And brighter lights than the kid has ever seen before
He's waited his whole life for the next eight seconds
And he'd do it all again for one ride in Vegas

A modern day legend and every cowboy knows his name
He's all settled down on his ranch down in Texas

With picture-perfect vision, she was the only one for me

Bought her a diamond ring; nearly everything this workin' man could not afford
A Chevy, a house, and the credit cards to her favorite department stores
Loved her all I could; I can't believe she would run off with some ol' used to be
Guess ya never know what the future holds, 'cause for her it wasn't me

Been searchin' for the lovin' parts, but the hurtin' ones are all I find
When she took her aim, she wasn't playin' no games

Descendents,"The days are blood No beginning, no end Bleeding like a fountain pen The days are blood Alarm clock rips open my eyes I'm so tired Staring at the black spots before my eyes Am I alive Mirror showing bloodshot eyes It never lies Another day on the 9 to 5 No when's or whys These days of blood, eyes of fire I gave at the office I gave at the bank I gave to my friends I gave to my enemies You tell me it's better to give than to receive So tell me why is it you that's bleeding me 7 O'clock - got to wake up Wake up Look in the mirror, see my face See the traces of yesterday Oh, for yesterday Oh, for tomorrow The days are blood Bleeding into each other The days are blood And I'm drowning And as I watch the evening news I realize Telling me of the day's slaughter I realize Spilling innards on my dreams I realize As I bleed cold sleep sweat I realize The nights are blood too.

Descendents,"I can't believe what you just said

You'd sell your soul for a dollar bill


I can see the signs in your eyes
The signs that make an honest man lie



You've got green on your mind

Now you've got green in your eyes

Say green is sex, green is power

I think you better go take a shower

Such filthy thoughts



You're seeing green

I'm seeing red



I can't believe what you just said

I heard your song, then I heard your spiel

Music as money has gone to your head
You're seeing green, I'm seeing red



I used to listen and we'd share your love

But now I want to steal your heart

It didn't matter that I had none to give



I've got green on my face
Claim it as mine before the bidding starts



Got jealous green I can taste


And yet I covet what I hateBitter-green bile because you're vile

Descendents,"It's dark outside, I'm riding alone
But I know the road
Can't even see ahead of my nose
But I know the road
A little scared, but I know where to go
'cause I know the road
I can do it by feel, take it real slow
I know the road
Hold on a fork in the road
Life in transition

Hold on moving too fast
In the wrong direction
Hold on gotta feel the road
Know my position

Over you shoulder, not another look
Burn off the shackles of a wooden past
Melt through the ice, be free at last
Dare to be stupid, dare to smell

Black hole explodes in my brain

Say it like you mean it, man
I wish I could, but I can't 

You say that life is a pain
It isn't for me, man
I don't feel anything at all
Shield myself from the world
Hold everything inside
Fold my arms across my chest
Shield the world from myself
Make sure the sleeves are tied

Wrap my arms across my chest

Why do I get my hopes up at all?
I've been living this Walter Mitty life
For too long

Somebody save me
I'm a prisoner of my own fear
Sometimes fantasy is the only
Thought I can bear

My mind is a dream-filled balloon
Dripping dreams into my shoes
And I'm too afraid to move
To face the real world

And when I fall, I fall down hard
When will I ever learn?
Don't take your dreams to heart
You'll only wind up getting
Burned

Maybe I'm lazy
But circumstances always knock me down
So I'll just lie here, never get up
Off the ground

But maybe it's crazy
To sit and think of all the things I wanna do
What's the use in dreaming when dreams
Never come true?

And when I fall, I fall down hard
When will I ever learn?
Don't take your dreams to heart
You'll only wind up getting
Burned

Why do I daydream?
Why do I daydream?
Why do I bother?

Descendents,"Spent the last years
In denial of my grief
Because you hated me
Anyone could see
I'll always wonder
What I meant to you
And why you hated me
What I did to you

I can't get anywhere
Pretending I don't care
Lying to everyone I see
When the only thing I needed was

One more day like yesterday
I'd pick you up, you'd put me down
Wish you were still around
For one more day like yesterday
With you

And in the end
We didn't have a thing to say
Still those games you play
Then you passed away
I'll always wonder
Why you had to leave
Why you hated me
Then laid the blame on me

Cold antiseptic stares
The smell of the sickroom air
Yeah, I let you go down there
The only child
Who never cared about

I'll always wonder
If I could have meant more to you
I'll always wonder
If I could have done more for you
How I could just turn my back
How I could just walk away
How I could just close my eyes
And watch you die

We never got along
We never got a chance
To sing our song of love

I loved my daddy boy
Did you love your boy?
Oh, you feel so warm to me now
But it's cold in this room
Tomorrow they'll put you in the ground
Then there's nothing I can
Ever do to have",One More Day

We can drift away, find our own blue sky
As long as you are with me I'll never stop dreaming

Got to learn to begin again
Learn to take it on the chin

I've learned to go out at night
Trying hard not to fight

Lately I've stopped growing
Lately it's been showing
You watch me like you're knowing
I've been missing you again

Trying not to think so much
I know it's just a mental crutch
I get to thinking about your touch
Cause I've been missing you

Got no goodness to redeem
All I do is think and dream
When we were walking as a team
And I was kissing you

My old friends won't let me down
My old friends are still around
They'll stay by me when I'm down

Three inches from my shoes

Held together with free spoon glue

Sheets and blankets on these paper pages
The people think I'm crazy
But I know I'm wiser than all the saviors
Cause I have money, they think that
I'm a fool to them when I do but I know it's right

Call me eccentric man

If ever I want to
I could have the comfort of my country home
But until that time
I'm quite content to have

A carpet of moss, a ceiling of sky
And a brown rat for a watch dog

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends

When I play the maracas I go chick chicky boom, chick chicky boom

Yes sir I'm Cuban Pete
I'm the craze of my native street
When I start to dance everything goes chick chicky boom

The senoritas, they sing and how they swing with this rumbero
It's very nice, so full of spice
And when they're dancin they bring a happy ring the maraquero
Singin a song, all the day long

So if you like the beat
Take a lesson from cuban pete,
And I'll teach you to chick chicky boom, chick chicky boom

Si, senorita, I know that you will like the chicky boom chick
'Cause it's the dance of latin romance
And Cuban Pete doesn't teach you in a hurry like Authur Murry
You're now in Havana and there's always manyana

You're loyal tonight
You're hung up on the touch of another
Lover
You may be human
Body and mind
Who's in control of your brain
When your heart's gone blind?

It feels so real
You can't help yourself (you can't help yourself!)
If your not made of steel
You've gotta sit yourself down
And tell yourself

It takes discipline
When you find someone
When you're deep inside
Not to come undone
When temptation tastes
Too dangerous
It takes discipline
When you make love

Born out of passion
It's hard to hold on
It's easier to drown in an ocean
Of emotion
So wind you up and
Get down to your soul
When every night a stranger comes knocking
But you're sleeping alone

You don't want to bleed
'Cause you've been hurt before (You've been hurt before! )
Surrender to your needs
But, Love, protect yourself
'Cause love is war

It takes discipline
When you find someone
When you're deep inside
Not to come undone
When temptation tastes
Too dangerous
It takes discipline
When you make love
It takes discipline
When you make love

And it feels so real
You can't help yourself (you can't help yourself! )
And your not made of steel
You've gotta sit yourself down
And tell yourself
It might feel like heaven but it might be hell

It takes discipline
When you find someone
When you're deep inside
Not to come undone
When temptation tastes
Too dangerous
It takes discipline
When you make love

It takes discipline
When you find someone
That you want so bad
That it drives you mad
When a kiss just isn't
Hot enough
It takes discipline
When you make love
It takes discipline
When you make love

When you're deep inside

Desmond Child,"We were young
We were restless
We were reaching for the stars
We had passion and we burned down the nights

We weren't ready
For a child in our lives
We weren't ready then
We were children ourselves
But it still hurts inside

I hope you're still up in heaven
'cause I need you now
I hope your still in labor
And can hear my prayers somehow
So that when I'm older
There will be no doubts
I hope you're still up in heaven
'cause I need you now

You'd be 16 now and counting
You'd have lovers of your own
And I'd be staying up
Just for you to come home

When the gift of life is taken
Can it ever be returned?
Or are you waiting in
The wings of my soul?

Oh, we weren't ready
For a child in our lives
We weren't ready then

But you know it's right inside

I need someone to hold
My hands are empty
And I'm reaching for you
When I'm all alone

Dessa,"The neon burns a hole in the night,
And the Freon burns a hole in the sky.
You can find my kind living right on the fault line,
Eyes on the seaside, lives on the B-side,
Kites on the power-lines.

But I don't know why you believe it or leave it alone.
It's just us walking home and dodging cars.
The rest of the believers follow brighter burning stars.

I spent a long year under glass,
Watching your reflection in the cases as you passed.
And cupid limps in two years too late with a love letter for the ugly sister.

I'm sorry but you missed her, Mr. Mystery to me,
How lost you seem to be.
From beneath, it all looks the same,
Gum-covered and rusted from the rain.

And the Freon burns a hole in the sky.
You can find my kind living right on the fault line,

Setting up just to knock, knock, knock me
Down, down down
Going down, down, down, down

Pull you close but when we kiss,
When we kiss I can feel the doubt
I remember back when we started
My kisses used to turn you inside out

I used to drive you to work in the mornings

With every minute now

Saw a hundred different places that I
Didn't think I ever go
It wasn't long before I found
That you covered up your traces in reply
Now I'm sure I'll never know
We'll never know

This can't be true love, no

Ladies, can you hear me?
This can't be love!
All my 'fellas, can you feel me?
This can't be love!
If you're feelin' kind of empty
This can't be love!
Scream it loud and sing it with me!
This can't be love!

Something that you said
Took my heart away
Now get out of my head
Leave - just go away

Destiny Praise,"Are you in bondage to the status of nice things 
Addicted to the attention and the compliments they bring 
Feeling the weight of growing debt with each bill 
That's not His Will 
That's not His Will 

If that's not you then maybe this one's on point 
Still need a drink or you gotta smoke one joint 
To get thru the pain of all the heartache that you feel 
That's not His Will 
That's not His Will 

It's not a trial, It's not a test 
God wants for you, His Best 
But not until you submit to His Will 

Do you need validation wrapped up in false love 
So you sneak out, to the strip club 
Knowing that nothing there can ever be for real 
That's not His Will 
That's not His Will 

Maybe you think that you will find it in someone 
So you sleep around hoping each time that you're done 
But that one is not found and you're still trying to heal 
That's not His Will 
That's not His Will 

It's seems unfair,It's so much stress 
God wants for you, His Best 
But not until you submit to His Will 

He heard your crying tears 
He knows your silent fears 
He wants to just renew 
His relationship with you 

Don't be afraid of facing everything inside 
Even the guilt, wrapped up in pride 
God will step but He's waiting until 
You're in His Will 
You're in His Will 

Don't you give up, don't settle for less 
God wants for you His Best 
But not until you submit to His Will 

Jesus is waiting 

To reveal His plan for you for real 

But it won't happen 

Til you stop and submit to His will

Destiny's Child,"Went from a dream to the young supreme

Hey, yeah
Ooh

Searching for a destiny that's mine
There's another place, another time
Touching many hearts along the way, yeah
Hoping that I'll never have to say
Boy, I love you but I gotta let you go (illusion)

Everyday in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again

Days in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again

Follow your emotions everywhere
Is there really magic in the air?
Never let your feeling let you down
Open up your eyes and look around
Boy, I love you but I gotta let you go (illusion)

Everyday in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again

Days in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again

Can it be a picture in my mind?
Never sure exactly what I'll find
Only in my dreams I'll turn you on
Here for just a moment then you're gone
Boy, I love you but I gotta let you go (illusion)

Everyday in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in

Days in my mind is confusion

Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again (yeah, yo, yo, yo)

Hey, yo I don't write love songs leave it up to Luther Vandross
How I choose to live, you don't wanna know the cost
I paid to be the boss, hear it straight from the source
Fortune 500 is how I like to gloss
High side, Korneesh Style, joy ride
Blowin' candles in the wind like Princess Di
Get at me, mom, tell me how you really like it
'Cause we could fly high, I'll be your co-pilot

Hey, yo back to the girl with all the razzamatazz
(Hey, yo, I love you shorty) You talkin' all that jazz

Boy, I love you but I gotta let you go
I know you want me but you play me like the lotto
Use and abusin' so there won't be no friction
I gotta leave, I can't be in this illusion

Oh, oh (It's just an illusion)

Everyday in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in

Boy I know you want me 
I can see it in your eyes 
But you keep on frontin' 
Won't you say what's on your mind 
'Cause each and every time you near me 
You give me signs 
But when I ask you what's the deal 
You hold it all inside 
If you want to be with me 
You gotta keep it real

Tell me how you feel 
'Cause boy I know you want me

Last time I seen 'ya, it's been a long time
Stop smilin' at me get that look off your face
Please don't even front stop being so fake
I know you do not like me yeah you made it very clear
You're always talkin 'bout me from what I hear
Always turn me down when you thought that you could
I want you to know that I'm doin' so good.

Wasn't it you that said
I thought I was all that and you
Said I didn't have a clue
Wasn't it you that said
That I wouldn't make it through
Wasn't it you that said
That I didn't look too good
That I wouldn't do too good
I'd never make it out the hood
I want you to know that I'm doin' so good

(So good, so good, so good)
I know you hate it, but I'm
(So good, so good, so good)
I'm doin' so so so so, so good
(So good, so good, so good)
It's hard to face it but I'm
(So good, so good, so good)

This is for them haters who said we wouldn't make it
Now we're doin' platinum and now you can't take it
But all the people round us that have been negative
Look at us now, see how we live
I stayed down with my people, all the ones that keep it real
Didn't get caught up and how'd it make you feel
All the things I'm doin' that you thought I never could
I want you to know that I'm doin' so good

Wasn't it you that said
Thought I was all that and you
Said I didn't have a clue
Wasn't it you that said
That I wouldn't make it through
Wasn't it you that said
That I wouldn't do too good
Look at me now ain't that good?
Now I've made it out the hood
I want you to know that I'm doin' so good

Destiny's Child,"You know Christmas was made for the chi'ren
Destiny's Chi'ren, 2G Christmas
Destiny's Child, ha ha, haaaa
Ah, kagigi, kabuki say what

On the eighth day of Christmas my baby gave to me
A pair of Chloe shades and a diamond belly ring
On the seventh day of Christmas my baby gave to me
A nice back rub and he massaged my feet

On the sixth day of Christmas my baby gave to me
A crop jacket and dirty denim jeans
On the fifth day of Christmas my baby gave to me
The poem that he wrote for me

The feeling that I feel is so good, he makes me feel so in la-la-la-la-love
If he only knew what he does to me, my man, my man, my baby
Oh he makes me feel so lovely, so sexy, I'm so in la-la-la-la-love
How I love him for his generosity, my man, my man, my baby

Doesn't it feel like Christmas (It feels lovely)
Doesn't it feel like Christmas (Feels so lovely)
Doesn't it feel like Christmas (Whoa)
Yes, it feels like Christmas

Doesn't it feel like Christmas (It feels lovely)
Doesn't it feel like Christmas (Feels so lovely)
Doesn't it feel like Christmas (The spirit of Christmas)
Yes, it feels like Christmas

On the fourth day of Christmas, my baby gave to me
A candlelit dinner, just me and my honey
On the third day of Christmas, my baby gave to me
A gift certificate to get my favorite CD's

On the second day of Christmas, my baby gave to me
The keys to a CLK Mercedes
On the first day of Christmas, my baby gave to me
Quality T-I-M-E

The feeling that I feel is so good, he makes me feel so in la-la-la-la-love
If he only knew what he does to me, my man, my man, my baby
Oh he makes me feel so lovely, so sexy, I'm so in la-la-la-la-love
How I love him for his generosity, my man, my man, my baby

Destiny's Child,"The day you pissed me off
I told Mike to pick me up
I told him you was buggin' and
I don't like to fuss
He said he would look out for me
If I needed a friend
He took me to his house and then he
Invited me in
Then we sat on the couch
He put his arms around my waist
Knowin' I need lovin' then he
Gently grabbed my face
He kissed me like a guy could never
Kiss a girl before
So you know what happened baby
I need to say no more

I'm just confessing
About the things I did
I might-as-well come clean

Remember the time you wondered
Where your money went?
I called my friends
And bought some clothes
And took them on a trip
I met a dude that had a jeep
And we talked all the time
He asked me bout my man
And you know that I had to lie
He thought I had no man
And I was chillin by myself
Don't get mad
'Cause I feel sad
That's why I must confess
Too many times I wanted to
Let you know my dirt

You loved me I knew it would hurt

All of her love just can't compare to what I have
She can't touch you like I do

If you're gonna brag make sure it's your money you flaunt
Depend on no one else to give you what you want

The shoes on my feet
I've bought it
The clothes I'm wearing
I've bought it
The rock I'm rockin'
'Cause I depend on me
If I wanted the watch you're wearin'
I'll buy it
The house I live in
I've bought it
The car I'm driving
I've bought it
I depend on me

It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till he appeared and the soul felt its worth

A thrill of hope, the weary soul rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Oh, fall on your knees
Oh, hear the angels voices
Oh, night divine
Oh, holy night when Christ was born

Oh, fall on your knees

Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

But baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do ya
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Destiny's Child,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you

For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn!

But the heartache lives on inside
And who's the one you're clinging to
Instead of me tonight?

And where are you now, now that I need you?
Tears on my pillow wherever you go(GO)
Cry me a river that leads to your ocean
You never see me fall apart

In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion taken me over
Caught up in sorrow, lost in my soul
But if you don't come back

Come home to me, darling

Destiny's Child,"When the days are cold
And the cards all fold
And the saints we see
Are all made of gold

When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst of all
And the blood’s run stale

I want to hide the truth
I want to shelter you
But with the beast inside
There’s nowhere we can hide

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide

When the curtain’s call
Is the last of all
When the lights fade out
All the sinners crawl

So they dug your grave
And the masquerade
Will come calling out
At the mess you made

Don’t want to let you down
But I am hell bound
Though this is all for you
Don’t want to hide the truth

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide

They say it's what you make
I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul
I need to let you go

Your eyes, they shine so bright
I want to save their light
I can't escape this now
Unless you show me how

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide

I put on my happy face
I'm living, I'm able,
I'm breathing, I'm grateful
To put on my happy face

Woke up and realized this world's not so bad after all
Looked at it through a child's eyes, and I saw these beautiful
Things that you never think about
Like the ocean, moonlight, stars and clouds
It's amazing how we don't appreciate our blessings
There's plenty of people who don't like me
But since there are more who love me and I love myself
Sometimes, it gets tough, it gets tough
But I can't give up, can't give up
Just take a deep breath, close my eyes
Feel the love and give a smile

You been right here through thick and thin
You are my best friend
Gotten me through places I have been
You are my best friend
Through our situations
You have been my inspiration
My best friend
Your still here and I love you

I think you got angel wings
Hiding up under there somewhere
Michelle, my belle
Dunno where we would be
If we never met you girl
I love you, I thank you
You such a blessing
I am so grateful
I truly believe the Lord
Sent you to me and Kelly
The smile the laughter
Always makes me happy
When I am too serious
Or too intense
With a voice that beautiful
You was heaven sent

My sister my life couldn't be better
Doing what I love with my best friend
And making Cheddar Kelly
The most beautifulest girl in the world
You are my survivor and I admire you
You have no idea how special you are
Humble, talented and blessed you are
Sometimes I wish I could be more like you
Sometimes they don't wanna give your credit to you
Wouldn't be a Destiny's Child if it wasn't for you
DC 3 forever I'm thanking you

Lord thank you for your vision
That we see down here on earth
Thank you for your precious gifts
Your sweet precious gift of love
Through everything can no one come between
Us three

Michelle, ah
Ain't it funny
God always know what he is doing
And he showed me some of that when you came
Into me and be in his life
And just let us know that we can count on you
And actually stay with a relaxed heart
Together we are sisters
Your smile has so much meaning so much life
You are the perfect fit
What more could we ask for
We got Michelle
Your voice is like water
Your voice is like rain
And the world ain't ready for you
I love you and I will always be here for you

Beyonce, we have come so far together
And it feels so good to have traveled
Half the road of life with an angel
Walking and learning and teaching you the whole time
God is so awesome
And I thank him for answering my prayers as a child
I never told you this, but I prayed for
A lifelong friend as a child
And God just has his way of sending precious treasures
And I found mine
Everyday our relationship gets stronger
And I love you for the loyal, unselfish
Generous, gifted, wise and beautiful
Person you are
No one absolutely no one can take that away from us
You are the definition of a true friend

B and Kelly you two mean so much to me
Only God knew that this union was meant to be
Only God knew all the things we couldn't see
But if we pray together
We'll stay together

Beyoncé and Kelly
You both exemplify coming from my eyes
What love is
Love is patient Beyoncé that's what you've been
Love is kind Miss Kelly, that's what you have shown
It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud
It is not rude It is not self seeking
It is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrong
Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth
It always protects, always trusts, always hopes
Always perseveres

Don't cry, you're beautiful
It's not your fault, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
You're not the one to blame
Soon it will be okay
One day you'll realize
Your beauty

It was a Saturday
This cold afternoon
Inside this house there lived
A frightened young girl
She didn't know what she should do
'Cause she missed her mother so
She was left home all alone
With her step father

Please dry your eyes, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
It's not your fault, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
You're not the one to blame
Soon it will be okay
One day you'll realize

He touched her places
That he shouldn't have touched
He did some things to her
That he shouldn't have done
So she ran into her room
Paged her mother 9 1 1
And the tragedy began
For this young girl

She told her mother
Her family, and friends
No one believed her
'Cause before this happened
She was filled with hate and anger
Towards her step father
'Cause he took her mother
From her when they married

Please dry your eyes, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
It's not your fault, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
You're not the one to blame
Soon it will be okay
One day you'll realize
Your beauty

She looked for her father
In the men that she saw
Thought that all she had to offer
Was her body
No one to figure out why
This young girl would live her life
In such pain and unhappiness
'Cause she was so beautiful

She rebelled and one day
The young girl fell in love
With another man like her stepdad
He abused her emotionally
And made her feel like she was worthless
Hope one day she realize
And see the beauty in her eyes
All she needs is prayer and strength
She's beautiful

Please dry your eyes, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
It's not your fault, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful

It's not your fault, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful

Destiny's Child,"Words are flowing out like
Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light, which
Dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander like a
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love, which
Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

Jai Guru Deva, om.
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Destiny's Child,"I changed my life for you and all that you could do
Is betray me, how could you play me
You got me doing things I know I shouldn't do
Am I crazy to live this way see

I know I'm wrong, I'm shamed everyday
We're not as one, but you think it's okay
My life is not meant to be lived this way, this way
You promised me one day we would be
Husband and wife but it seems to me
You're moving further away from me, from me

Lord I'm trying to do what's pleasing in your sight
But I'm in love, right now I'm caught up
Instead of leaving, I know that you'll be right by my side
And you'll make a way, just have your way

I spent too much time playin wife on many nights
Keepin you happy, giving you all of me
I wake up every morning feeling guilty cause you're lying next to me
Father forgive me, thought by now we'd be married

Four months ago you promised me
By now I'd have my wedding ring
You've shown no commitment to me, to me
I cannot blame you for using me
If I continue to let this be
Cause shacking with a man just ain't me, ain't me

At the Mardi Gradi on the island
(Do you think I'm a nasty girl) 
That's what I heard
When I looked up it was Cheryl with sex apparel
Said she drove a 1998 Montero
I said a poncho, all about dinero
Head honcho, girl, you're soncho
Lets pronto to the condo
Where me and you could lay low and sip on Mo
Before the girl had a chance to respond
Got booty in the words about a female named Yvonne
Yvonne was a little freak I did last week
In the backseat of her mamas Yukon
Why you trippin', we were just flippin'
Only thing on my mind was hit and no commitment cause

Condos, I'm the most, parlay, pimpin' like style
Take a flight to relax in ? go and buck wild
In the room partner zoom straight gettin' on yours
? bathroom sinks and these carpeted floors
A friend and it all it started with a fuck in the end
Say my name, blaze the cane, then we started again
Salty water make a star, baby, take yourself far
Papa C-Notes eatin' shrimp, free drinks from the bars
Always first class friends, mafio dividends
Push it to the limit while I'm in it, name the place
and when cause

Destiny's Child,"How many times
Are you gonna apologize
About the same thing
And how many times
Can I take you back
When I'm not the one that's doing wrong
I thought maybe If I started praying
Then we would get better but
When I would pray, the answer would always come
Back to me, being done
But we're so hard headed
When we're in love

So I

I told myself
That I would make some changes
But the more I change
There's one thing that remains the same
I can't seem to shake ya
You seem to really have a hold on me

And every time that we break up
We turn around and make up
This can't go on now
I've gotta move on now
It's not the fact
I love you no more
But I've got to break this bad habit
Can't take this bad habit no more

I'm totally out of my element
I'm learning new ways to live
While you're in a comfort zone
Not even thinkin' (gotta think about me)
To call me when I get mad you buy me gifts
Thinkin' it's gonna solve every issue

From the girl callin' my phone
To the pictures that I saw
And every time you would break up with me
For nothing at all
I've taken all I can take
(I've taken all I can take)
But the way I live has gotta change
Oh

I told myself
That I would make some changes
But the more I change

And every time that we break up

I've gotta move on now
It's not the fact

But I've got to break this bad habit
Can't take this bad habit no more

So much that you was just too blind to see
Oh yes!
All of the pain, that they was causing you (causing you)

Have you ever loved somebody
So much that you went against

Imagine how intense it would be

At night, when you're far and I'm alone
I feel the fabric from your t-shirt
Close to my body
I can still hear your baritone
In my ear telling me you'll take it slow
And I was in the mirror playing a roll
Like you work it, I couldn't turn me on
So I fell asleep with the music on
Woke up again hearing the same old song, playing

(Oh) give it to me deeper
(Oh) giving me the fever
(Oh) now you got my feet up
This one is a keeper
Now the second verse is playing

Hold up a minute, thought I heard your name
My mind, playing tricks on me again
I hear knocks at the door, is that baby home
Why couldn't it be reality
Looked at the clock it says 4:03
At nine he'll be arriving on a plane
Then we'll be making love and hearing the song again

(Oh) give it to me deeper

He was cute so I asked him if he had a lucky lady claiming him

He made it clear that he was single
And he was searching for a partner just like me
Chapter four
We landed and he said we just can't end it 
'cause he needed a little more time wit me

He likes to wear Calvin Klein
With the open front fly design size 32
Think I'm lying
I never could describe his birth mark
If I never did let him hit and get into this
Think I'm lying
I can even tell you your size
'cause you left your bra behind in his bathroom

Destiny's Child,"LeToya Barzini, I wanna thank you
For having me organize this meeting here today
And Kelly Steracki I also want to thank you
And all the other dons of the four families

Beyonce Corleone from the South West
Ah Latavia Menser from the four-four
Our objective of this meeting today is to discuss
Destiny's Child's commandments of relationships

You know it's so unfortunate, so unnecessary
For us to end up with broken hearts
Yes godfather times have changed
Relationships aren't like the old days you know?

See what we need is a man of his word
All this, uh cheating, uh backstabbing, hating no more, no more
But godfather, how do we avoid all these mishaps?
It's obvious, the writing's on the wall, thou shalt not hate
",Intro (The Writing's on the Wall)
Destiny's Child,"This is for you Ms. Ann 
Who is now with our heavenly father 
Who made the real commandments. 

A ma zing grace 
How sweet ( How ow sweet sweet) 
The sound (The sound)

Saved a wretch ( a wretch)

I once was lost (lost) 
Lost (lost) 
But now But now

What you say girl?

They still can't feel you 
But now

Was blind, 
But now

Chapter one
LAX departure
Flight 1106 he sat right next to me
Chapter two
He was cute so I asked him if he had a lucky lady claiming him
Chapter three
He made it clear that he was single
And he was searching for a partner just like me
Chapter four
We landed and he said we just can't end it 
Cause he needed a little more time wit me

Weeks later we datin'
Taking me all kinda places
Showing me thing I never seen
It was kinda crazy
I'm relating to this man so I gave him 
Every hidden secret part of me

Oh oh then it switched
What is this overheard your messages
When I questioned you, you said she's a friend
Now it's funny that I'm runnin' into you is that your group
Nigga tell her I'm your main event

[Chorus]
Why you actin' like you don't know
Who I am
After all the trips, all time we spent
Now you act like we weren't doing it
Why you actin' like you don't know
Girl I know your man
I drove his whip, I bought his rims
And I know its gone hurt you proving it
Why you actin' like you don't know
Who I am
After all the trips, all time we spent
You gone act like we weren't doing it
Why you actin' like you don't know

After all the trips, all time we spent
And I know its gone hurt you proving it

[Kelly:]
Think I'm lying
His Mama, Mrs. Parker 
And I sat down in the den and watched Comic View
Think I'm lying
His boxers
He likes to wear Calvin Klein
With the open front fly design size 32
Think I'm lying
I never could describe his birth mark
If I never did let him hit and get into this
Think I'm lying
I can even tell you your size
Cause you left your bra behind in his bathroom 

Weeks later we datin'
Taking me all kinda places
Showing me thing I never seen
It was kinda crazy
I'm relating to this man so I gave him 
Every little secret part of me

And I questioned you, you said she's a friend
Now it's funny that I'm runnin' into you is that your group

[Michelle:]
See you makin' it harder
For the other man
When a real woman
Try to let you in
Now she lookin' at me
Thinkin' I disrespect
But that's not my way girl 'cause I wasn't raised like that
You accusing me
Should be checking him
Insecure of me
'cause I dealt wit him
Woman to woman I ain't got time for foolishness
I'm out the door 
This is my cue 
I can't go through with this

Now you wanna act like ya don't know what to do
After I done everything that you asked me
Grabbed you, grind you, liked you, tried you
Moved so fast baby now I can't find you

Oh
I'm startin' to believe that I'm way too much for you
All that talk but it seems like it can't come through
All them lies like you could satisfy me, 
Now I see where believing you got me
Gave you the wheel, but you can't drive me

[Chorus]

Oh
Two things I don't like when I tryin' to get my groove
Is a partna that meets me only half way and just can't prove
Take me out so deep when you know you can't swim
Need a lifeguard and I need protection
So put it on me deep in the right direction

Oh
You understand the facts that I'm tryin' to give to you
You movin' so slow like you just don't have a clue
Didn't mama teach you to give affection?
You're the difference of a man and an adolescent
It ain't you boo, so get the steppin'

If you can't make me say ooh
Like the beat of this drum
Why you ask for some and you really want nothin'
If you can't make me say ooh

Destiny's Child,"You know, we've been spending a lot of time together and um, I was wondering do you:
(Feel the same way I do)
I can tell you, I know you need me to show you, but, it's better if I hear it from you.
You know what, let me explain myself.

It's seven am you're still here with me, and last night I held you tightly so.
What does that mean, you see I know what it means to me.
It means that I, I, wouldn't let you go.
Tell me, is your heart still spinning from the night before?
(You are real good yeah).
And you really need to let me know are you here just for, (sexual dealings).
See if you are then, (I), I just can't live a, (lie), cause I'm certain how I feel about you.
But if you tell me, (I), am the one and this is, (right), 
Then we can spend the night tonight like always.
But first you, gotta tell me

[Chorus]
That you (Feel the same way I do)
Don't think you know, that I won't let you know unless you (Feel the same way I do)
So if you tell me what I gotta do, before I get caught up in you.
Do you really (Feel the same way I do)
So tell me, tell me, us can be a good thing.
But you gotta (Feel the same way I do) do.

So now it midnight, haven't heard a reply.
But I can see the truth lies in your eyes.
Could it be that you tried, but I didn't see the sunset pass me by, when you were making love to me.
Said it three times, (you said) you love me, (after) you held me.
But then you never even said goodnight.
(Anything I ask of you) you give it, (when you wanted me) I submitted, still no commitment, but if I don't get it then,
(I) I just can't live a (lie), cause I'm certain how I feel about you.
But if you tell me, (I), I am the one and this is, (right), you can spend the night tonight like always.
Long as you first tell me

[Chorus]

Ooh I see your eyes, and I hear you calling.
When you're speaking and I need to hear something.
First thing I wanna hear (I've been meaning to tell you something).
The second thing is (If I can't have you I don't want nothing).

Who that knockin' at my door this time of night?
Ooh oh, hey baby.
What you doing over here so late?
I wanted to tell you somethin'.
I just, I don't know how to tell you right.
Do you have anything you want to say?
Alright, you know what, I love you

You said you just got in the house 
It's hard to believe that you 
Are at home, by yourself 
When I just heard the voice 
Heard the voice of someone else 
Just this question why 
Do you feel you gotta lie 
Gettin' caught up in your game 
When you can not say my name 

I know you say that I am assuming things

Boy I know you want me 
I can see it in your eyes 
But you keep on frontin' 
Won't you say what's on your mind 
Cause each and every time you need me 
You give me signs 
But when I ask you what's the deal 
You hold it all inside 
If you wanna be with me 
You gotta keep it real 
Tell me what's goin' on 
Tell me how you feel 
Cause boy I know you want me 
Just as much as I want you 
So come and get my love 
It's all here for you 

[Chorus]
You'll be sayin' no, no, no, no, no

But you don't know what to say 
When I walk up to you baby 
You seem so shy 
What's the problem baby 
Never had a girl like I 
I can see right through you 
And you know you wanna be mine 
So get your act together 
Cause you're running out of time

[Chorus]

Every time I see you with your boys 
You pretend as if you don't want me 
When you get home you call me on the phone 
And tell me how much you care 

Yo, close your eyes, shorty 
You're guaranteed to be hypnotized 
By the remix that Wyclef provides 
I don't care 'bout your size 
Girl shake your thighs 
All I'm tryin' to do 
In the hood is stay alive 
Make a little money with Destiny's Child 
Thugs hear this song, they dance, they go wild 
Like Texas, they movin' like 
No limit soldiers 
They went from a dream to the 
Young supremes, sing it girls

I think you know what to do
No talk about loving, what you can do for me

Destiny's Child,"There are times I find it hard to sleep at night
We are living through such troubled times
And every child that reaches out
For someone to hold
For one moment
They become my own

And how can I pretend that I don't know
What's going on?
When every second
And every minute
Another soul is gone

And I believe that in my life
I will see
An end to hopelessness
Or giving up
Or suffering

Then we all stand together this one time
Then no one will get left behind
And stand up for life
Stand up
And here me sing
Stand up
For love

I'm inspired
And hope
For each and everyday
That's how I know that things are going to change
So how can I pretend that I don't know
What's going on?
When every second
And every minute
Another soul is gone

And I believe that in my life
I will see
An end to hopelessness
Or giving up
Or suffering

If we all stand together this one time
Then no one will get left behind
And stand up for life
Stand up
For love

And it all starts right here
And it starts right now
One person stand up man!
And the rest will follow
From the forgotten
And From the Unloved

I'm gonna sing this song,

And I believe
That in my life
I will see
An end to hopelessness
Or giving up
Or suffering

If we all stand together this one time
Then no one will get left behind
And stand up
For life
Stand up

To hold me right now
Our song's playing

At night, when you're far and I'm alone
I feel the fabric from your t-shirt
Close to my body
I can still hear your baritone
In my ear telling me you'll take it slow
And I was in the mirror playing a roll
Like you work it, I couldn't turn me on
So I fell asleep with the music on
Woke up again hearing the same old song, playing

(Oh) Give it to me deeper
(Oh) Giving me the fever
(Oh) Now you got my feet up
This one is a keeper
Now the second verse is playing
(Oh) We tried to stand up
(Oh) Hold me why while my hands up
(Oh) And the music picks up
Fantasies were shook up
I'm thinking to myself again

When you're not here (I sleep in your t-shirt)
I wish you were here  (to take off your t-shirt)
After we make love (i sleep in your t-shirt)
Wake up in your t-shirt
Still smell the scent of your cologne
When I need your feel (i sleep in your t-shirt)
I need your help (to take off your t-shirt)
After we make love (i sleep in your t-shirt)
Wake up in your t-shirt
Still smell the scent of your cologne

Outside I hear the rain on my windowpane
Hold up a minute, thought I heard your name
My mind, playing tricks on me again
I hear knocks at the door, is that baby home
Why couldn't it be reality
Looked at the clock it says 4:03
At nine he'll be arriving on a plane
Then we'll be making love and hearing the song again

(Oh) Give it to me deeper
(Oh) Giving me the fever
(Oh) Now you got my feet up
This one is a keeper
Now the second verse is playing
(Oh) We tried to stand up
(Oh) Hold me why while my hands up

Oh boy I've been waiting
Now my body's shaking
You're so deep, baby please, take it easy
I look at your face and
Got my heart racing
You're so deep, baby please, take it easy

Keep it right there
Oh, wait wait, yeah
Keep it right there
You driving me crazy

Kiss and touching feels better

Or the warmth of sun after rain, you

I want you near might sound cliché
But my words are so sincere can't you
Taste the joy inside my tears (I'm so in love)

And now that I have, have you
I won't search for anything more
Oh love
What have you done to me

It feels like love it must be love it must be love
Feels like snow caressing mountain tops
When I see your eyes from afar
All I can do is run with open arms
Love is all I got
I feel so at home
When we're alone, oh

Love, when I'm in your arms
Feels like I'm melting into you
You keep me so warm
Ooh, I feel so high above
Caught a glimpse of heaven in your eyes
Thanks for showing me love (your love so good)

Baby we will grow together; this is a joint endeavor
And there's nothing I'd rather see
Than the love in your eyes for me
'Cause this feeling is so surreal
You touch me places I didn't feel
I used won't but now I will trust in love
I'm elated and overjoyed.
Over this connection between a girl and boy
I was empty till you filled the void

Destiny's End,"I'm Obscure, the shadow black
Alone I walk on the shunned path
Centuries mine, reveal the past
The unknown yawning black

Treading the lone path others fear to explore
Open gates to realm of eternal night
Material world, nothing to me now
I am one with the darkness
Seek not the light

Alien core, light is not for me
Free in the dark with the coffin worm
Survived alone in the world's dusk
Your gods are dead, earth buried them

Riding the night wind
Soar above the tombs
Of sorcerers departed and towers burned
Doom has taken shape and sealed Earth's fate
Still I live strange years
Stand beneath the stars

Free to ride the solar winds
Above the dying land
Taking my solace in dimensions far
This pale, blank aeon

Recall years when the worlds sailed
Darkling tides in crimson skies
In galleries ever I search
For haunted crypts where no lamp burns

Lurking in the cavern deep within the mind
Crowning the throne of dreams with the blackened gems
Dwelling in the towers both ruined and vast
I am he who returns when the scythe shall fall

Free to ride the solar winds
Above the dying land
Taking my solace in dimensions far
This pale, blank aeon

Once I sough the shape of the world around me
Once I dreamed I'd walk the common path
Once I let the weakened minds disguise me
Once I thought I lost my outer shell

Dark world is rising
The sky is black
The light of day's not coming back

I'm the night, my visions dark
Alone I tread the ancient track
Centuries mine, learned from the past
The unknown yawning black

Treading the lone path others fear to explore
Open gates to realm of eternal night
Finding the release in the cosmic scheme
Welcome the exile from those they called men

That is your life must end
Withering to ashes
You'll meet oblivion

Awaiting the scythe to steal each moment from your lungs
Underneath the cold stars, you'll stand your ground
Dancing through night lands evading death's ends
Shadows will stalk you through all your days
Annihilation before the dawn

First you'll dream of scenes divine
And truths beyond reality's lie
First you'll seek goals soaring high
Never knowing when you'll die

Your days are numbered on this earth
Risk awaits you at every turn

Someday you'll end it all
Ignore possibilities
From out of nowhere
Your quest renews again

Each precious moment is worth the wait
Shocking awareness, chances not to waste
Nothing is perfect, no dream equal
Just one companion, the guise of death ahead

That somebody is near to release (and to fight)
Suffering of your sins and fear

To save your light to lose your vice
Where is your destination?
Any hesitation?
Soon you'll lose some control
Hatred and pounding craving for nothing

Made to be broken - like he broken glass of your soul
Made to be broken - like your fucked up one man show

It's like damn I can't refuse
All the great ideas that come with tattoos

Difícil é esquecer o que eu passo

Fico inconstante, pareço iniciante
Eu vou fazer de tudo

Even virgins wanna come into my snack bar.
Don't hate me because I fucked your favorite band.
Beer bottle in my pussy, let's do a keg stand (bing).
And let me show you how to sit on that dick.
America's next top model, click click.
I'm the ringleader girls follow my trends.
Got hannah montana doing anal with my friends.
Pull my hair, scratch my back, beat me like rihanna.
I love ass to mouth and black cock like obama, what?
We showed you how to turn off the lights
So give me some fucking twilight neck bites.

In the back sittin' v.i.p, that's right.
And you're still waiting outside with a girl, mad.
Because I got into the front line, with a gun.
Yeah it's all fun till your laid out with your brains out
And you end up on the other side of the club.
With your face down.
While my whole club bangs out of control.
It's out of this world.
The way you shake them hips make me like ""damn girl"".
The way them lips taste make me think damn sure
That your sucking dick straight from the men's bathroom.
A little drip drip because you suck a dick quick.
It's awesome, bitch, then you realize ""oh shit! ""
Took that shit out,
When it smelt like cold fish.
A little chlamydia ain't gonna do shit.

You can tell his army you're looking at his car keys.
Got a problem, add it up, damn right, I'm tatted up.
California, stand up, and go on, put your hands up.
I'm sipping on whatever, so she can look better.
I don't want a problem, so I bought the condoms.
Truth is in the house, she must be in some luck.
I've seen her at the club, and heard she wants to fuck.
I'm gangster like white walls, sitting on a regal.
I hear no, I see no, I speak no evil.
Rock your boat, baby I'm the coolest skipper.
Live up in this hospital, ain't nobody sicker.
Balling, baby, my truth speak for itself.
I got the lvs on the bag, just to match the belt.
I like the smiles on your bitch and that's a fact
I put some miles on your bitch and send her ass back
That's right.

These ladies go crazy, they wanna have all my babies.
They love me because I'm famous, and haters hate that I made it.
Oh baby, oh baby.
Let me get in your mercedes, I know you got a friend or two, maybe.
I hope she ain't think we're dating.

I'm heroin, I'm like ecstasy.
All these girls want sex from me.
Blowing up my phone, always texting me.
All they want to do is get next to me.
I'm schizo, I'm loco.
They're mad because I'm rolling solo.
I'm rich trying to get that mo-dough.
And in the bed these girls say I'm a mofo.

Deuce,"Never was a killer, 
But I spilled enough blood 
Never thought I'd be the one, 
To sweep your fuckin' ashes underneath my rug 
People come, 
And people go 
But I ain't people 
So tell your people when they see me 
They gonna feel the evil 
You missed the past, 
Off them city lights, 
And make it last 
Now you're sayin' ""rest in peace"", 
Packing all your bags 
Say goodbye, say goodbye, 
But save your last dance 
Take your last glance at me, 
Now it's your chance! 

[Chorus: x2]
(If you died) 
Goodbye, goodbye, 
Everything will be alright 
Goodbye, goodbye, 
I promise I'll be by your side 
Goodbye, goodbye, 
Rest in peace alone, 
I wouldn't put a fuckin' flower on your gravestone 
(If you died) 

I used to be the boy, 
The only boy my momma had 
Now I'm sitting in this house, 
Underneath my past 
Cleaning out, where we used to drink and laugh 
Thinking what had happened, 
How it happened, 
How I didn't see the past 
Seemed like it all happened all too fast, 
Thinkin' sound was my mask, 
I was caught up, lost in the mask 
Now it's dark, 
And now it's black 
I missed the contrast, 
You say it's black and white, 
Black and white my ass! 
And in these moments, 
I've been wrong 
These moments seem so long, 
Ticking on the clock, 
Till the moments gone 
And I don't wanna go back 
Relapse the day, 
Collapse the faze, 
While I'm looking down the drain 

[Chorus: x2] 

See my conscience don't work no more, 
It don't hurt no more 
And it don't hurt to see you lying, 
It don't work no more 
So when I'm saying 'stay away' 
Realize I ain't fuckin' playing 
Younger, like my younger days, 
May be hungry but I'm crazed 
Raised by criminal ways, 
Hear the chandelier break 
It ain't no mistake, 
I'm waitin' on Nolana's grave 
And can't get pictures from my veins 
Ain't no fucking me for Jane 
Naked for my brothers rein, 
On my arm, you'll see the same 
And if I never see your face, 
I will always feel the same 
Divide me from the wrongs 
So when I'm gone, 
My spirit will live on 
Let my lyrics show you God!

You could judge this when I flip middle finger up a little while I quit,

These thousand drums make you want a little click,
Put 'em around in there, make 'em drown in with,

Like Monica Lewinsky when She's sucking on a 6 inch toothpick bitch, 
Just got her boobs in so she can do it do it 
Make a new clit. While these kids are downloading and he sounds profound,

The whole music industry can lick my nuts,
Motherfucker I ain't got no love for some fake ass wannabe Donald Trump!

From thos lazy babble rattle you, with my cracy battle,
Paid my dues back on the saddle the lonely road thay I slowly travel.

Ain't never gonna stop me, this is it
I can hear my voice bitch,
Everyone knows I'm on fire, shit,
Its the reason why these white kids buy this
Theres no more Undead, its Nine lives,
This punk-ass better go home or retire, with his mama
'cause its already to late to stop what I did
It hurts when I rip this mic' up, slap you upside
And call you 'my bitch' if you can't play the game fucker
Better stand outside it
You ain't never gonna have no fame again,
Both you and your boyfriend in bed
Look at these faggots, how I beat them with
Just the touch of a pen
I could' a smacked you hard but I tapped you bitch
And wrote this song instead, like I said in story of a snitch,
We are not best friends
I almost flew over the cuckoo's nest, I had to get shit off my chest,
You tried to push my ass off the edge, but I got Nine lives homey,
I ain't dead

I came to party, I came to party
Hands up girl give me that body
I can tell you want somethin' from me,
'cause everything you think girl I can see
I came to party, I came to party
Hands up girl give me that body
I'm a make you mine before I leave,
'Cause every little thing you do to me,
got me goin' crazy",Till I Drop
Deuce,"You want my life, you wanna take away what's mine
But I got my rights and I'll keep singin' 'till the sun don't rise

It's like a game for me to watch you suffer in pain
It's my favorite thing, and I'ma do this shit 'till you're slain
You could go and ask God, even he wants you dead
I'll put you into shame every time that my pen hits the paper
Mista Mista I'm the new Docta Davis, who tries to rap, but can't even sing
The only time he sounds good is when he's spreadin' his rumors
Fillin' up his beer gutt with the last of his Cooler's
Yeah Right, Dumb Man, don't you ever compare me to you
I'm the next Dre, you're that dude who can (?)
And now you're chokin' 'cause your career is over for you
I fuckin' smoked you, both you, don't you got something
Better to do than they tell each other who's cuter
Mr Cool Dude, oh yeah, I forgot to tell you that your mom's a loose bitch
And her two kids can suck my dick, you know who this is!

[Chorus]
As I walk alone.. I still sing for tomorrow
Don't you forget that when I meet you, there won't be no sorrow
These streets are cold, but this lonely road I follow
I'm not scared, 'cause I know I'm comin' home tomorrow

Hello? Dr. Drew says he don't like me
If he's got a problem with my penis, he can bite me
Motherfuckers think 'cause I'm on the radio
They can buy me and put these asse's right beside me
You think I'ma sit here lying Fuck that
I ain't gonna let no psychologist pump back in my city nine milly milly
Singin' with me
I got the truth and the spirit, you can try to hear me
There's a certain magic when I spit and only few can match it,
'Cause I'm right above the ceiling, it's a normal habit
That's why these people say I killed their fake God (?)
So take up all these feelings, so when you need me
Just say, ""How you doin'?""
I don't need that other crap about how u grew up
And You can take the other route and just say ""Wow you Blew up ""
But behind my back, you're sayin', ""How the fuck did he do it""

As I walk alone.. I still sing for tomorrow
Don't you forget that when I meet you, there won't be no sorrow

Yo, some may view me as a villain,
They treat me like a felon
So music's like a weapon
My mind is like my senses
I know when they pretend shit
Acting like it's friendship
Kiss my fucking necklace
Ask Joe hes my motherfucking witness
In every single line I spit I spit like I'm 2pac and shit
But yeah, I'm still rocking it, still walking it

Frost, kick it to these people for real you know what I'm saying?
[verse 1 - Frost]
Time, sits through the hour glass, through night and day
and I watch as the games people play
It's like do unto others than split
and if you can't back up what you say then you ain't shit (yeah)
I've seen the manifestations of the street
so why can't I confess what I see on a drumbeat
like just last night (yo what happened)
I watched these two vatos get in a crazy fight
one of them was quick to pull a knife
he stabbed him in the heart and now he's doing life
in prison at the age of 21 (yeah)
living on death row cause he couldn't let go
caught in the web of violence (damn)

so go ahead take bow for a job well done
but you'll never see the day of the sunshine or the fun times
just the old days and your old ways

while you sit in a cell writing a letter
saying when you get out, your things will be better (right)

with every Tom, Dick, and Harry
and if you ask me, your shit's getting scary

Fell madly in love with a couple of beautiful ears
It's only a variation
Had long and boring conversations about nothing
Talked so much, I bored myself to death
And the more I talk, the more I turn into a vegetable

You've been listening to the doors tip top
Entering a smoky barroom hey you
Smuggling a wombat what a day
Chewing on my necktie tweedoll
Tumbling in the margarine heroine
Hidden in the ribbonbrass too too
Actin' like a baby headcase

I don't need no thoughts in me, don't you want to rescue me?
There's a little light below, go there when I want to go

Want to buy the bubblegum? ping pong
Trying to pry the red shoes off headcase
Licking on my ice cream cone heroine
Surfing in the kitchen sink what a day
Sippin' on a diet coke hey dude
A toodle to the innercrop tip top
Shopping with my scapegoat top fish
Change a tenner for two fivers too too

Fell off the floor, fell off the floor man (8 times)

Rita hayworth (3 times)

Don't strap yourself to a Volkswagen in a weird harness
Get a harness, because it could be dangerous

Don't try this at home

Going out to steal a ruby (4 times)

Looking like a rayon, love to do it indoor
They all got a say on, falling off the damned floor
Succulent but sucked in, always I'll be in for
Wanted to be tucked in, falling off the same floor

dEUS,"The plan it wasn't much of a plan
I just started walking
I had enough of this old town
Had nothing else to do
It was one of those nights
You wonder how nobody died
We started talking
You didn't come here to have fun
You said: ""well I just came for you""

But do you still love me?
Do you feel the same
Do I have a chance
Of doing that old dance
With someone I've been
Pushing away

And touch we touched the soul
The very soul, the soul of what we were then
With the old schemes of shattered dreams
Lying on the floor
You looked at me
No more than sympathy
My lies you have heard them
My stories you have laughed with
My clothes you have torn

And do you still love me?
Do you feel the same
And do I have a chance
Of doing that old dance again
Is it too late for some of that romance again
Let's go away, we'll never have the chance again

You lost that feeling
You want it again
More than I'm feeling
You'll never get
You've had a go at
All that you know
You lost that feeling
So come down and show

Don't say goodbye
Let accusations fly
Like in that movie
You know the one where Martin Sheen
Waves his arm to the girl on the street
I once told a friend
That nothing really ends
No one can prove it
So I'm asking you now
Could it possibly be
That you still love me?
And do you feel the same
Do I have a chance
Of doing that old dance again
Is it too late for some of that romance again
Let's go away, we'll never have the chance again

In smithereens
Your kingdom
Has gone down my friend
Camelot
In washed out jeans
Your staying power
Has come to an end

The sweetest stroke
Went up in smoke
And love's a joke
Or a spaceship
Or a plant
Or a tubezipper
It's what you want it to be

It must have crossed your mind
You run a little behind
With all schemes and programs
You have 'em built in
Need a small device to screw it out
And unlearn the craft
You been drilled in

(It's too late, you are now becoming) NATURE

Backdated trip
Backfired whip
You bite your lip
But do what you want

And then a shoulder to cry
Makes your eyes run dry
Stop-start nature
I wish you all you wish for
And when I walk I will stumble no more
It's a new beginning
It's a new dawn

And all the magic you missed
And all the days you squandered
And all the nights you passed out
Countless are the nights you wandered

It's as good as you can handle
It's as good
It's what you want it to be

It must have crossed your mind
You run a little behind
Stop-start nature
I wish you all you wish for
And if I run I will hurry no more

Making a point in conversations
That I'll never hold
Protect myself from the rumours
That I will never be told
Choking on beauty
I usually don't even see
I'm living life through someone else
Looking at me

Here comes, here comes the night train

Now all the evil thing I done
And all the harm I ever did
Stand right before me
Eyes wide open
Where were they hidden?
I'm gonna rip it up
Bring it down
Send it to hell
Somebody teach me something new
Somebody as guilty as me
Can break this spell

Here comes, here comes the night train

Open your eyes
Let the black blooded vein
Come to your brain
Angels round here don't sing
They have a curse upon me

The lovers
The tricks
The blessings

I pity you
I dream of you
What are you?

Leave it there
Bruise a heart
Leave it there
Pay the entrance
Leave it there

Shouldn't be this
Shouldn't be that

When you say things loud

Like it when you shake that thing
With the finest touch

Think about it when you touch me there
Close my eyes, here you are all alone dancing in the dark.

Tell me baby if it's wrong
To let my hands do what they want?
Late at night I pretend we are
Dance dance dancing in the dark

Dancing in the dark
Oh la la oh la la oh la la
Dancing in the dark

When you work on me,
Open my body up and do some surgery,
Now that you got me up I wanna taste it taste it
And see those pocket aces.
I wanna see who you are.

I got a sex drive to push the start
I got a sex drive to push the start
I got a sex drive to push the start

On my waist, through my hair.
Think about it when you touch me there.

Dance dance dancing in the dark!

Dev,"You got a girl
That doesn’t look a thing like me
The girl, your mother always said it would be
So, you could say that, you could say that
I’m hopeless

But that ain’t the girl
That ain’t the girl I want you to be
The girl that keeps me up
And I see in my dreams
So, you could say that, you could say that
I love her

So I don’t care what they say
It’s our life life life
We can dance if we want
Make it feel alright
Temperature’s rising
I feel the fire
Tonight, it’s just me and you

Tell me baby, will you be here when I wake up
Even with no make up
I don’t want to fake it

And you don’t gotta doubt a second if I miss you
Every time I’m with you
I feel naked

Hey! I feel naked, I want it, so let me get it,
You say you got it, won’t you come to get it

If I told you girl
Come and run away with me
Now would you throw it all away for me
I need to know that, need to know that
It’s not over

Cause you were the boy
Daddy told to stay away from me
But you’re nothing but a fantasy
I need to know that, need to know that

You’d be strong enough to believe in us

Cause I don’t care what they say
It’s our life life life
We can dance if we want
Make it feel alright
Temperature’s rising
I feel the fire
Tonight, it’s just me and you

Tell me baby, will you be here when I wake up
Even with no make up
I don’t want to fake it

And you don’t gotta doubt a second if I miss you
Every time I’m with you

Hey! I feel naked, I want it, so let me get it,
You say you got it, won’t you come to get it

It’s our life life life

Tonight, it’s just me and you

Yeah, I'm a Taurus
They say that we're patient lovers

But you're Aries

If you should feel thirsty
I'll be sure to bring you water
Yes, girl, I got candles
That will slow burn longer

And I know your favorite love song
And how you like it on repeat

To dream of us till we meet again
You may even be encouraged
To take a walk so we can love again

When she created you
And girl, I am thankful
For how our love has bloomed

Ten thousand people waiting for me
I can hear them outside from the curtain I sit behind
The drums kick in and the lights go down
My heartbeat drowns out the sound
My hands go up, I sing my song
And a thousand voices sing along

I used to lay awake
Hear a crowd roar to every word I say
Now the stars, they used to shine so bright
They were all replaced by candle lights
And it all, makes it harder to find the places that we know

Think about it when you touch me there
Close my eyes, here you are, all alone dancing in the dark.
Tell me baby is it wrong?
To let my hands do what they want

Late at night I pretend we are: 
Dance-dance- dancing in the dark
Ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la 
Dancing in the dark

Dev,"I was sittin' on the beach, starin' at the nite
Pulled out a cigarette, and you were there with the light
What you tryin' to do, lookin' in my eyes
Pretty boy step back, you don't wanna take this fight
But if you wanna talk, well first you gotta listen
I ain't like those other girls that you been missin'
I knew it all along, queen of my throne
One of a kind, I'm in a league of my own

And get your hand off my hip, and kiss my lips
Kiss my lips, kiss me all over
Are you gonna take that risk, take that risk
'Cause we're only gettin' older
I said kiss my lips, kiss my lips, and do it all over
I know you weren't expectin' this tonite
But baby that's me

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

I feel you gettin' hot, I can see it in your face
Bet this is what you want, to finally get a taste
To savor every drop, remember every kiss
You'll only get one shot, and this is it
And I know you've been waitin', since you heard me on your radio station
You know the situation, so boy please

Get your hand off my hip, and kiss my lips
Kiss my lips, kiss me all over
Are you gonna take that risk, take that risk
'Cause we're only getten' older
I said kiss my lips, kiss my lips, and do it all over
I know you weren't expectin' this tonight

I know what you want, you know what I need
Show me what I came for
There's only one thing you gotta do for me
Just promise not to stop when I say so
Just promise not to stop when I say so

And get your hand off my hip, and kiss my lips
Kiss my lips, kiss me all over
Are you gonna take that risk, take that risk

Dev,"They say I gotta have a plan
I say if you don't burn you won't tan
They say I gotta watch myself
I had my cake and watch it melt
Uh, I'm gonna pack it with a rocket, I'ma cock it
And blow the roof off this boojie club
Fuck the haters, gimme some love
Don't be so pretentious
I fake gold like a dentist
And if I said it, then I meant it
He a soccer player, he headed
I'm going lightspeed
Drinking rice drink, dripping Visine
Bitch, cover your eyes
You won't find me
Even beside me you're behind me

By the time you on it I'll be off it
By the time you get it I'll be done wit' it
You know that we be going lightspeed ahead
Everybody told me I should slow down
But instead all I could do was take it
Lightspeed out of space and there is no calculation
Tell me, am I out of my head?
Or are we really going lightspeed?

We are experiencing some turbulence
It's the Cataracs

If you ain't on my flight you gettin' flown over
Under a palm tree, that's where I'm lying
Like when I tell people I'm sober
Got a devil on one shoulder and an angel on the other one
But I ain't never listened to none of 'em
It's been a crazy road running
And no, I ain't never stopped running
People talking about something
But I, I ain't never heard nothing
The sun is set and the clouds are moving
The sky is black and I'm used to it
We awake all night, who knew it?
I got a dark soul, you could never see through it

By the time you on it I'll be off it
By the time you get it I'll be done wit' it
You know that we be going lightspeed ahead
Everybody told me I should slow down
But instead all I could do was take it
Lightspeed out of space and there is no calculation
Tell me, am I out of my head?

Now I sell out shows, bouncing up and down,
Flying all around, doing my thing and,

Stunting on these ho's, brand new frames,
Brand new rides with the candy paint,
Damn who knew I could shine so bright,
I want to feel this way everyday of my life,

But I, I like what I see
And you don't gotta be on movie screens
Cause god damn boy you're for me
And don't call me a star in these old denim jeans
You are that thing that's setting me free
So stay the night
Talk to me
Let's have a drink
Boy get lost with me

When you need to breathe
I'll make your heart beat twice as fast
Like a cigarette
And I will be your perfect match
Perfect match
Perfect match

I wanna stay up late and laugh with you all night
Story tell about both our lives
And we can lay side by side
Boy we're done for the ride
One night you know I love your style
And the taste of your bitter sweet smile
Won't you scream with me
A little nightmare and a dream with me

When you need to breathe
I'll make your heart beat twice as fast
Like a cigarette
And I will be your perfect match
Perfect match
Perfect match

Whispers calling
Falling don't let me
A hair just sparkled
Let me up it'll set us both free

Everywhere I look I see shadows
Haunting over me

Lost in my mind late at night
And you're who I see in my dreams

A pain that doesn't sting
I know I've ran and I know I hide
I know I've changed, I know I lied
I knew I should but I couldn't see
Bridges burnin' in back of me
Ooh, help me out, holy ghost
I have lost the only thing I know
And all, all I have left are shadows

Everywhere I look
Everywhere I look I see shadows
Haunting over me
And I wonder when they'll let me be

I wonder as the morning news
I wonder when tomorrow's done
The words you never got to hear
They were just right there on the tip of my tongue

Sometimes I scare myself
By my own lies that I once bought
They cannot be resold
Sometimes I feel the hurt
If I was gold I'd turn to sand
And in the end it could not hold
I know I've ran and I know I hide
I know I've changed, I know I lied
I knew I should but I couldn't see

Buy some time, we can make it somehow!
Waiting for a dream to come around
You know me better than that,
Baby I’m not down, down, down!

I left a letter for my sister, and a bottle full of booze
One day I’m gonna love you, too
But for now I’m running oh,
I’m running south, south, south!

You say you better have a way back home
But I know they won’t forget my name back home
Cause they know I’m running oh, I’m running south!

Can you see it on my face, small town girl, never knew my place
So I got first and lined for the race,
People telling me to let your dreams go to waste, waste, waste, waste
But what are dreams if you never sleep?
Now my dreams are life, and this life is sweet
Trippin’ in the lights, a piece of the pie
I think I need a slice, slice, slice, slice

How can I be lost in the dark?
I thought I was walking on stars,
And even if I wanted took a stop
I can’t go back home, cause I came this far,
So can you see it on my face, man?
Are you amazed, the way I make magic in a wasteland
Los Angeles, California
I love you bitch, let me lick you and put a stamp upon you!
A flower blooms, then a bug eats it
I heard a rumor, should I feed it?
I got a secret, can you keep it?

And give me got shout, with a 12 gate
Throw you an ass of Jame like 12 play, huh

Devendra Banhart,"I remember a far away laugh a sweet caress you'd help me zip up my dress.
And I remember your arms wrapped around my neck twenty one shells wrapped in a nest.
Endlessness. Didn't last.
I won't change given the chance.

I remember no place for me to hide. Before you came home at night.
And I remember you turnin' out the lights all i ever saw was the red in your eyes.
No big surprise. Happened nearly every night your own flesh & blood.
I did wonder why.

I remember not knowing what to say & how calm you had remained your child still born with no name.
I remember the never ending summer rain.

Please don't let what was get in the way of whats next.
Don't forget that whats to come hasn't come yet.",I Remember

I wanna be your thing, your anything your everything oh yeah

I'll give you my sweet grass
I'm gonna mesmerize your ass
Just give me my first chance, it's gonna be the last
I'm gonna make you wanna stay

Give you all the milk around town
Let me see, let me see you drink it down

Try my fruit and taste my seed

Climb right on me, lay it on me
C-climb right on me, l-lay it on me!

It was at this precise moment that he saw her. Her walk was soft and delicate, with a thaumaturgical touch that only a rabbiÃ¯Â¿Â½s daughter could have. Before their eyes had even met, her luminous lips had already lured him in. Salvation winked with the promise of a Bris held at pinnacle and a congregation of sage's bunny hopping and chicken dancing to Yiddish Mento. Then their eyes linked, an aeon blinked, Amharic vows were scryed upon their hearts. Just to think, this could be with the frenectomy and a few words of love...

I don't want to start over again
A stone I keep falling over again, and again, and again

You begin to nullify, everything that we've ever done
You're fucking with my head
As you vilify all I've ever given
I don't want to fall apart anymore
I want to end it right now
When you vilify, I start to ponder every battle ever fought
Every thought, imploding in my head
If you vilify, it's a bitter pill that I will force you to devour
Enough, why don't we end it right now?

I've had my fill, and I think I've had enough
When you open your mouth, every word incenses me
Don't want to know, why you every waking moment
Revolves around, criticizing every part of me
Another bill, the number cannot be defined
For the blood and the soul, that had to flow incessantly
Fuck you all And let every minute be a reminder of
How you let it all come crashing down

Device,"Who was the one that stood beside you through the war of your life
Who stood defiant in the face of your enemy
Who was the one you could confide in when your adversaries made you run and hide
There's no messiah out there waiting to deliver you now
You've lost the war and have surrendered your sanity
What was before has now been scattered from the heavy devastation left behind

Look how affection will reveal the shadowy image of the criminal inside

DevilDriver,"Regrets, night sweats
Occasional thoughts of suicide
Green light, I'm ok
Feeling fine, just a little tongue tied
Old habbits die hard and I've lived so fast
And I know its a long way down

Between sin and sacrifice
Long long way
Between sin and sacrifice

lost sleep, count sheep
Can't seem to get my mind off of things
Toss and turn, candles burn
Grinding teeth at night endlessly

And I know its a long way down

",Sin & Sacrifice
DevilDriver,"This abomination
Won't see the end of days
Sit throne of lies, torn
By the voice on high

Death was only a dream
Not devastating disaster
The rights of passage
The past that we can't alter

Fuck you, you
And the horse that you rode in on
Just sit there
And be silent as the grave

You've come out this time
Smelling just like roses
I sit there, watch while I drink my wine

The weight of your sins
And the evil beneath us
Will surely drag you down

The axe shall fall
On the one-winged angel
Breaking the spell
Would you break this fall?
For he, who sins against his kind
The axe shall fall

Alright, alright

With a hollow heart and hollow eyes
I cry from your cross, serpents in disguise
Hearts of distrust is what he's despised
I sit there, watch while I drink my wine

The weight of your sins
And the evil beneath us
Will surely drag you down

The axe shall fall
On the one-winged angel
Breaking the spell
Would you break this fall?
For he, who sins against his kind
The axe shall fall
Alright, alright

The axe shall fall
On the one-winged angel tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
",The Axe Shall Fall
DevilDriver,"Brothers and sisters
The Lord's taking his own sweet time
Without rhyme or reason
The failure is not thine

Like wolves to a virgin
The intention is made clear
At war with ourselves
At war with the odds

At odds with the fear
Hard time will bring you way, way down
And all of this running
It's gonna be the death of me

When they ask you about this
Tell them I was running in the company of wolves
It's the company we keep, brotherhood
Bound by the moon, by the moon

Went to the well
But the goddamn thing was dry today
I spent all of my life
Running from suicide

Is it the fucking fool
That keeps on chasing the dream?
Got a dream that cannot fail
So proudly we hail

When they ask you about this
Tell them I was running in the company of wolves
It's the company we keep, brotherhood
Bound by the moon, by the moon

And we shall roam
And the wolf fucking fucked her
Lay as she lay bleeding on the moors
Bleeding on the moors

Running in the company of wolves
It's the company we keep, brotherhood
Bound by the moon

Brotherhood of wolves
",Bound by the Moon
DevilDriver,"Come forth for the cattle call
Confront the evil river you can't control
Wicked ways and venomous eyes
Just human nature in disguise

Lost in this world, out on the edge
With death by our sides
Today I sworn that I wouldn't mourn ya
Clouds over California

If that's the way it's gonna be
I'm a saint in sinners eyes
Curse the clouds over California
This is the call to obey
Let the chaos reign

Bloodshot and weary-eyed
We took you in full of sin and pride
It'll take you and break you away
It'll tear you apart
Today I swore I wouldn't mourn ya
Clouds over California

If that's the way it's gonna be
I'm a saint in sinners eyes
Curse the clouds over California
This is the call to obey
Let the chaos reign

I'm a saint in sinners eyes
Curse the clouds over California
This is the call to obey
Let the chaos reign

If that's the way it's gonna be
I'm a saint in sinners eyes
Curse the clouds over California
This is the call to obey
Let the chaos reign

I'm a saint in sinners eyes
Curse the clouds over California
This is the call to obey
Let the chaos reign",Clouds Over California
DevilDriver,"Secure and hold fast
Before you lose control
It's hell or high water
Believe in gods, hoovers, horns and thunder
Days of wrath, don't go seeking shelter
Poison creeps, serpents slither, then slumber

Bastards, paradise, true the bargain was made
Full thrust, enticed to an early grave
Deals were struck late into a cold winter's eve
The table was set, laid out for the feast

Secure and hold fast, before you lose control

Head on to heartache
Beware of the promises made
Head on to heartache
Steadfast to an early grave (Let them rot!)

Deals with the Devil, there's no second best
It's in my nature to say fuck the rest
Ever thought the world was crashing down?
Man, people were talking all around

Bastards, paradise, true the bargain was made
Full thrust, enticed to an early grave
Deals were struck late into a cold winter's eve
The table was set, laid out for the feast

Let them fucking rot!
Let 'em rot

Secure and hold fast, before you lose control

Head on the heartache
Beware of the promises made
Head on the heartache
Steadfast on an early grave (Let them rot!)
",Head on to Heartache (Let Them Rot)
DevilDriver,"What the fuck do you want from me?
It's so damn plain to see that you're not grateful
Silence takes courage
No scars, no truth but the wounds tell the story
Of what will be done for honor and glory

Silence is deafening
Does the end justify the means?
In all honesty, how do you sleep?

Silence takes courage
The horn of betrayal
Sounds loudly for the fallen
While mine eyes are worlds away

Watch cowards as they bend [Incomprehensible]
Scratch a liar, find a thief
Inside is where the demon dwells
So I bite my tongue and when it comes to you

Silence takes courage
Your heart needs amputation
Crying the get-lost blues, fuck you

Silence is deafening
The horn of betrayal
Sounds loudly for the fallen
While mine eyes are worlds away

Watch cowards as they bend [Incomprehensible]
Scratch a liar, find a thief
Through the lies and the blasphemy
You are fucking dead to me
You are dead to me

This de los muerte, this day of the dead
It turns for me celebration instead
Skull and bones, walking away from the throne
To seek another kingdom, another kingdom
Another kingdom, another kingdom

Your selfish lies
Your selfish waves of sorrow washed over me
Your selfish lies, like a sea of new memories, lies
",Horn of Betrayal
DevilDriver,"Is there a promised land
Or am I on the journey going to nowhere?
Are the streets paved with gold
Or am I slipping on the mold
That slowly grows there?

Every man has his conscience
Sanity left along the way
Carried in this vessel
Setting forth together now
Out towards the monsters of the deep

Set your sights on rocky shores
You just might run aground on the reef
Journey's in the destination, mention fear
You're falling on deaf ears

Every man has his conscience
Sanity left along the way
Carried in this vessel
Setting forth together now
Out towards the monsters of the deep

Left along the way
Carried in this vessel
Setting forth together now
Out towards the monsters of the deep
Monsters of the deep, oh
