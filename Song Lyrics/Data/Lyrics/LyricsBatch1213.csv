The Cheetah Girls,"Everybody tells me to let it go, I think their crazy, they just don't know, I wish that they saw things the way that I do, I'm not that different I'm just like you


I still look for shelter when the rain starts to pour, sometimes I get mad over nothing at all, but I cant let it break me, gotta give it my all, if I stand for nothing then I fall

[Chorus]
Sometimes up, sometimes down, livin my dreams with my feet on the ground, I'm not perfect nobody is, I gotta break out this box ya tryin ta keep me in, woah, woah, livin my dreams with my feet on the ground, woah, woah, gotta break out this box ya tryin to keep me in


I'm my own burdin, gotta carry the weight, cant point the finger for my mistakes, wont let no one tell me who I should be, cuz at my I answer to only me



I still look for shelter when the rain starts to pour, sometimes I get mad over nothing at all, but I cant let it break me, gotta give it my all, if I stand for nothing then I fall

[Chorus]
Sometimes up, sometimes down, livin my dreams with my feet on the ground, I'm not perfect nobody is, I gotta break out this box ya tryin ta keep me in, woah, woah, livin my dreams with my feet on the ground, woah, woah, gotta break out this box ya tryin to keep me in


If I wait around and let somebody tell me how to live, ill be inviable, wont let you hold me back, wont let you keep me boxed in, even though

[Chorus]
I'm sometimes up, I'm sometimes down, livin my dreams with my feet on the ground, im not perfect nobody is, I gotta break out this box ya tryin ta keep me in, woah, woah, livin my dreams with my feet on the ground, woah, woah, gotta break out this box ya tryin to keep me in",Break Out This Box
The Cheetah Girls,"Thought I knew what I want
Busy chasing love
Down a one-way street

I pushed it to the limit
Even through all the traffic
Thought your love was what I needed for me

That's when I blew my horn
Hoping he might hear the beep
But I wasn't sure

Without a single warning
Suddenly he was turning
Now he noticed me

I guess the thrill was gone
I had a change of heart
Too late to change my speed

Baby we crash
And I can't hit the breaks
I want to slow down
But I think it's too late
Love happened so fast
You seemed like a mistake
I wanna past but I'm going too fast
Baby we crash

Baby we crash
Love happened fast
But boy we crash

Wish that I saw a sign
But I was driving blind
Thought I had control

I wanted love so bad
I didn't think to ask
Before I drove a hundred miles on this road

That's when I blew my horn
Hoping he might hear the beep
But I wasn't sure

We got so out of hand
Love didn't go as planned
Didn't like his style

But now the wheels were turning
Cupid was busy working
I couldn't slow things down

Baby we crash
And I can't hit the breaks
I want to slow down
But I think it's too late
Love happened so fast
You seemed like a mistake
I wanna past but I'm going too fast
Baby we crash

Baby we crash
Love happened fast
But boy we crash [Repeat: x 2]

What was I thinking?
What did I do?
All that I knew was
You seemed like you were cool

Where do we go now?
Was this all fake?
Wish I could turn back
But cupid stole the brakes
I found out too late

Baby we crash
And I can't hit the breaks
I want to slow down
But I think it's too late
Love happened so fast
You seemed like a mistake
I wanna past but I'm going too fast
Baby we crash

Baby we crash
And I can't hit the breaks
I want to slow down
But I think it's too late
Love happened so fast
You seemed like a mistake
I wanna past but I'm going too fast
Baby we crash

Baby we crash
And I can't hit the breaks
I want to slow down
But I think it's too late
Love happened so fast
You seemed like a mistake
I wanna past but I'm going too fast
Baby we crash

Baby we crash
Love happened fast
But boy we crash",Crash
The Cheetah Girls,"My baby's so fresh and he can do no wrong
He tells me im the best and tells the haters be gone
If you don't already know let me put you on
My baby's so fresh and he can do no wrong

There ain't no doubt about it my baby can do no wrong
They think I'm mad about it I'm not I just play along
Say what you want to I'm convinced that he can do no wrong
I stop the world and tell them my baby can do no wrong

[Chorus]
Lookin' at us everywhere we go
People starin' like can they roll
How we do it they just don't know
I can tell they'll never get it
Lookin at him he's so Sincere
Whisperin' nothin's up in my ear
They tell me leave him but I don't care
My baby can do no wrong

Tell the operator there's a problem, problem, problem
They say my baby's lying I ain't caught'em, caught'em, caught'em
Cause nothing in this world could
Nothing that I heard should
Change the way I feel because I got him, got him, got him [Repeat: x 2]

People they talk because their jealous of how tight we are
They see us everywhere we ride a round in fancy cars
Say what you want to cause I don't believe em', believe em'
Cause sometimes love don't have a rhyme or reason, reason

I know they think its madness and they think that I should leave
Cause every time I see his smile he puts my heart at ease
So when they try to give advice and tell me what to do
Just keep on talkin' now that I ain't even hearing you

[Chorus]

Tell the operator there's a problem, problem, problem
They say my baby's lying I ain't caught'em, caught'em, caught'em
Cause nothing in this world could
Nothing that I heard should
Change the way I feel because I got him, got him, got him [Repeat: x 2]

The Cheetah Girls,"Six hours behind, the changes of time
Ten thousand miles from home
I`m so far away, so long it seems like
This road is all I know
When I was young I dreamed of adventure
And places I`d never seen before
But when I close my eyes at night
All I dream of now is home

[Chorus:]
So long, that I`ve been gone
If there`s one thing I know
Is that there`s no place like home
Far away, it changes everyday
If there`s one thing I know
Is that there`s no place like home
Six months since the day I went away
It didn`t seem like that long
It hit me when I was changing planes
From Paris to New York
I`m dreading the days that are ahead
I haven`t slept in my own bed
Oh, I`m dreamin' of home
What I`ve seen and what I`ve done
Don`t mean a thing without where I come from
Who I am and all I ever did
Home is where the heart is (where the heart is)


(Chorus)


Call me, tell me that you miss me
Give me somethin', I can
Hold onto and get me through the days when I had
To take another moment
I need some clarity
Remind me what it`s like to be
There`s no place like ho-o-ome

Far away
There`s no place like home
I wanna go home, home, home (I know x5)
Bring me back home, home, home (He-e-e-ey)
Home, Home

So long, that I`ve been gone
If there`s one thing I know
Is that there`s no place like home",Homesick
The Cheetah Girls,"There comes a time
When you have to look back
At your life, all the things you know that
You have done, all the things that you've become

It's hard to say, all the reasons that you walk away
Did you think that I was just too strong?
Let me tell you you were wrong

[Chorus]
'Cause even though I made it on my own
Sometimes the world is cold standing alone
I'm reaching for a hand that I can hold
'Cause in the end I'm only human
My heart's not made of steal
I'm looking for someone to break my shield
'Cause even superheroes have to feel
And in the end I'm only human

I may stand my ground
But doesn't mean my mind's not spinning 'round
Don't be deceived by who you think I am
There's so much more you just don't understand

Have you seen me cry?
Have you ever really looked into my eyes?
Would you see the world's around me in that high
Did you ever really try?

[Chorus]

There's so many signs to me
So don't be fooled by what you see
Underneath all of these lies
I'm human on the inside

I'm only human, I'm only human, I'm only human...

[Chorus]

I'm only
I'm only
I'm only
I'm only...Human [Repeat until fade]",Human
The Cheetah Girls,"So sad when you sat at the corner
She couldn't dance
Caught her a while forward
She didn't know about it
The beat grabs a hold of your soul

So she nods her head
And she snaps her fingers
She has it in her
Taps her feet to the speaker box
She doesn't dance but tonight
She might take the chance

[Chorus]
Look up in the sky
Reach for it
It's your guitar
Get it girl you know
Fly like a shooting star
Let the music take you
Off the wall

The light shines bright
It lights up the dance floor
And now she's jumping
Dj's playing her favorite song
She's thinking the beat gots
A hold of her soul

So she nods her head
And she snaps her fingers
She's got it now
Her feet are poppin' like pop rocks
The way she's rocking
Now she's a dancing queen
She is causing a scene

[Chorus]

From the shadow to the spotlight
Lift it now she can fly
Spinning 'round and 'round
She lifts her hands and closes her eyes
It's got a hold of her and won't let go
It's in her heart and now it's in her soul

[Chorus]",Off the Wall

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep

It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

How does it feel like to sail in on the breeze,
And how does it feel like to spend a little lifetime

The Chemical Brothers,"As I walked along
The supposed golden path
I was confronted
By mysterious spectre
He pointed to the graveyard
Over on yonder hill
I paused in cosmic reflection
Confused on wondering
Of how I came to die

Hm!
I was confused
Coz if I was dead
How and why did I die
And I composed myself
And decided I should face it

Then I stood paralized
On the supposed golden path
And I was confronted
By powerful demon force
And there was the devil
And we spoke his words
Flowed like glowing lava from the mouth of a volcano
And I said:
Help me, Lord!
I found myself in some kinda hell
But I did not believe in heaven and hell
World in opposites kind of reality

But I gained control of myself
And decided to press on

As I walked along
The supposed golden path
I was trembling with fear
All the lions and the wizards yet to come
I seen in the distance
Silver mountains rising high in the clouds
And a voice from above did whisper
Some shining answer from the moon

over on yonder hill
I paused in cosmic reflection
confused and wondering.
Of how I came to die to die... (to fade)
Hmmm I was confused 
For if I was dead 
how and why did I die?
but I composed myself 
and decided I should face him
But I stood paralyzed 
on the supposed golden path.
and I was confronted 
by a powerful demon force
and they said it was the devil
and when he spoke his words flowed like glowing lava
from the mouth of a volcano
and I said help me lord ( to fade)
I found myself in some kind of hell
but I did not believe in a 
Heaven and hell world of opposite's kind of reality
and I gained control of myself
and I decided to press on
and as I walked along the supposed golden path
I was trembling with fear all the lions and wizards yet to come.
I seen in the distance silver mountains rising high and the clouds
and voice from above did whisper some shining answer from the womb.
Please forgive me I never meant to hurt you
Please forgive me I never meant to hurt you
Please forgive me I never meant to hurt you
Please forgive me I never meant to hurt you
As I walked along 
Please forgive me I never meant to hurt you

As he walks out of this land

Move on to my own

There's no path to follow
There's no path to follow
There's no path to follow

Living for the reasons
Of the dead that moved to
Paper from their heads
Until my fingers
And my deadly view is
Strangled by the rent

I have no purpose in this land
Have I forgotten how to stand up
With the humor and the need
I've got to find a way to be

I just turn up the stereo
I can't survive without the cold
This culture's fallen off its feet
I've got to find a brand new beat

Beat, beat, beat
Beat, beat, beat
Beat, beat, beat, beat

There's a road ahead
'Tween the live and dead
Church bells are ringing
Like the panic in my head

Step, step, one by one
Walk into the setting sun
Water's rising, rising fast
History catching up at last

Danger ahead, death behind
No one to follow but old man time

Time, time, take us back
Before the line was drawn
Before the sky turned black, black, black",Battle Scars

The Chemical Brothers,"Hello, boys and girls, my name is Fat Lip
And this is my friend, Sammy the Salmon
Today we're gonna teach you some
Fun facts about salmon and a brand new dance

Let me introduce to you a brand new dance
I know you're gonna love it if you give it one chance
It's not complicated, it's not too hard
You don't even have to be a hip hop star

See, anyone can do it, all you need is style
Listen up, people gang, I'm a show you how
Your hands to the side as silly as it seems
Shake your body like a salmon floating upstream

(I float upstream)
You know how we do it
You know how we do it again

All my peeps spend part of their life
In fresh water and part of their life in salt water
Wow, very interesting
They change round a couple of days after spawning then we die

When I first did the salmon all the people just laughed
They looked around and stood like I was on crack
I heard somebody say out loud
""What the fuck is that?
This nigga's dancing like a fish, while he's doing the snap""

But the more I kept doing it, the more they were feeling it
And then I heard some bitches say, ""Yo, that nigga's killing it""
By the end of the night, everyone was on my team
And the whole club was dancing like a salmon floating upstream

(I float upstream)
You know how we do it
You know how we do it again

Most of our friends find their home waters by sense of smell
Which is even more keen than that of a dog or a bear
Wow, my family also rely on ocean currents, tides
The gravitational pull of the moon

(I float upstream again)
The moon? Fish pay attention to the moon?
Wow, who knew?

Did you know
What?
That I could go to Japan and back?
You're kidding me? Amazing, Geez

Polluted water can kill both baby salmon
That are developing and the adult salmon
That are on their way to spawn

Wow, what a shame, what a shame
Hey, kids, hey give it up for Sammy the Salmon
And his amazing salmon dance

Five seconds 'fore you're saying my name
I'm deadly sharpshooting the game
Gonna hit you and this whole execution is aim

The Chenille Sisters,"I met a boy called Frank Mills
On September twelfth right here
In front of the Waverly
But unfortunately I lost his address
He was last seen with his friend, a drummer
He resembles George Harrison of The Beatles
But he wears his hair tied in a small bow at the back
I love him but it embarrasses me
To walk down the street with him
He lives in Brooklyn somewhere
And he wears his white crash helmet
He has golden chains on his leather jacket
And on the back are written the names
""Mary"" and ""Mom"" and ""Hell's Angels""
I would gratefully appreciate if you see him tell him
I'm in the park with my girlfriend and please
Tell him Angela and I don't want the two dollars back just him",Frank Mills

And bound to make mistakes
But it was all right
By the moment I would awake and, oh

Oh, let me be
The man my daddy was
Oh, let me be
The man my daddy was

Sometimes I hope
I don't live to see the day
When he reaches down
And take them both away

And look at my children
Sometimes foolishly they play
Let me live long enough
Let me show them the way

My clothes were sometimes untidy
And that bed was never made
But mom and dad would scold me good
Never doubted I've made the grade

But now that I'm a man
I ask the Lord up above
Please let me raise my children right
And be the man my daddy was and, oh

To come and sit a spell
I sat down to try to be prepared
For what she?d say

And what she said brought tears to my eyes

That I may one day rue.

Along the enchanted way
And I said let grief be a falling leaf
At the dawning of the day.

We tripped lightly along the ledge
Of a deep ravine where can be seen
The worst of passions pledged.

The Queen of Hearts still baking tarts
And I not making hay,
Well I loved too much; by such and such
Is happiness thrown away.

I gave her the gifts of the mind.
I gave her the secret sign
That's known to all the artists who have
Known true Gods of Sound and Time.

With word and tint I did not stint.
I gave her reams of poems to say
With her own dark hair and her own name there
Like the clouds over fields of May.

On a quiet street where old ghosts meet,
I see her walking now away from me,
So hurriedly. My reason must allow,
For I have wooed, not as I should

His wings at the dawn of the day.",Raglan Road

One morning last July,
From a boreen green came a sweet colleen
And she smiled as she passed me by.
She looked so sweet from her two bare feet
To the sheen of her nut brown hair.
Such a coaxing elf, sure I shook myself
For to see I was really there.

From Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay and
From Galway to Dublin Town,
No maid I've seen like the brown colleen
That I met in the County Down.

As she onward sped, sure I scratched my head,
And I looked with a feelin' rare,
And I say's, say's I, to a passer-by,
""Whose the maid with the nut brown hair""?
He smiled at me and he says, say's he,
""That's the gem of Ireland's crown.
It's Rosie McCann from the banks of the Bann,
She's the star of the County Down"".

At the Harvest Fair she'll be surely there
And I'll dress in my Sunday clothes,
With my shoes shone bright and my hat cocked
Right for a smile from my nut brown rose.
No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke
Till my plough turns rust colored brown.
Till a smiling bride, by my own fireside
Sits the star of the County Down.

Brought tidings of the same:
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name.

From Satan's power and might.""

Rejoiced much in mind,

Where our dear Saviour lay,
They found Him in a manger,
Where oxen feed on hay;

Unto the Lord did pray.

The Chieftains,"I knew of two sisters whose name it was Christmas,
And one was named Dawn of course, the other one was named Eve.
I wonder if they grew up hating the season,
The good will that lasts til the Feast of St. Stephen

For that is the time to eat, drink, and be merry,
Til the beer is all spilled and the whiskey has flowed.
And the whole family tree you neglected to bury,
Are feeding their faces until they explode.

[Chorus]
There'll be laughter and tears over Tia Marias,
Mixed up with that drink made from girders.
Cause it's all we've got left as they draw their last breath,
Ah, it's nice for the kids, as you finally get rid of them,
In the St Stephen's Day Murders.

Uncle is garglin' a heart-breaking air,
While the babe in his arms pulls out all that remains of his hair.
And we're not drunk enough yet to dare criticize,
The great big kipper tie he's about to baptize.

With his gin-flavored whiskers and kisses of sherry,
His best Chrimbo shirt slung out over the shop.
While the lights from the Christmas tree blow up the telly,
His face closes in like an old cold pork chop.

And the carcass of the beast left over from the feast,
May still be found haunting the kitchen.
And there's life in it yet, we may live to regret,
When the ones that we poisoned stop twitchin'.

Their flocks of lambs and feeding sheep; 
To whom God's angels did appear, 
Which put the shepherds in great fear.
""Arise and go"", the angles said.
'To Bethlehem, be not afraid, 
For there you'll find this happy morn, 
A princely babe, sweet Jesus born.
 
There were three wise men from afar
Directed by a glorious star, 
And on they wandered night and day
Until they came where Jesus lay, 
And when they came unto that place
Where our beloved Messiah was, 
They humbly laid at his feet,

On the 23rd of May
We were taken on board by a pleasant crew
Bound for Americay

Fresh water there we did take on
Five thousand gallons or more

Far away from the Shamrock shore

So fare thee well, sweet Lisa, dear
And likewise to Derry town
And twice farewell to my comrades bold

If ever fortune, it should favor me
And I do have money in store
Well, I'll come back and I'll wed the sweet lassie I left
On Paddy's Green Shamrock Shore

We sailed three days, we were all seasick
Not one on board was free
We were all confined to our bunks
With no one to pity me

No fond mother dear, our father kind
To comfort my head went to sore
This made me think more on the girl I left
On Paddy's Green Shamrock Shore

Well, we safely reached the other side
In fifteen and twenty days
We were taken as passengers by a man
And he led us in six different ways

So then we all drank a parting glass
In case we'd never meet more
And we drank our health to old Ireland
And Paddy's Green Shamrock Shore

To leave their own country, it would grieve their heart sore
Oh, the tears down their cheeks, in great floods they are rolling
To think that I must die upon some far and foreign shore

If in peace and contentment I can spend my life

With no taxes or tithe there to devour up your wages

Gone are the winders of baskets and creels
And away o'er the ocean, go journeyman cowboys
And fiddlers who play out the old mountain reels

Ah, but I mind the time when old Ireland was flourishing
And most of her tradesmen did work for good pay
Ah, but since our manufacturers have crossed the Atlantic
Well, it's now that I must follow onto Amerikay

And now to conclude and to finish my ditty
If e'er a friendless Irishman should happen my way
With the best in the house, I will greet him and welcome him

To a city fair rode I
There armed lines of marching men
In squadrons passed me by

But the Angelus Bells o'er the Liffey swells rang out in the foggy dew
Right proudly high in Dublin town
Hung they out a flag of war
'Twas better to die 'neath that Irish sky
Than at Sulva or Sud el Bar
And from the plains of Royal Meath
Strong men came hurrying through
While Brittania's huns with their long range guns
Sailed in through the foggy dew
Their bravest fell and the requiem bell
Rang mournfully and clear
For those who died that Eastertide in the
Springing of the year
While the world did gaze with deep amaze
At those fearless men but few
Who bore the fight that freedom's light
Might shine through the foggy dew
And back through the glen
I rode again
And my heart with grief was sore
For I parted then with valiant men
Whom I never shall see n'more

And I kneel and pray for you

One day as I was walkin' down by a shady grove
I spied a lord of high degree conversing with my love
She sang her song delightfully while I was sore oppressed

Well, I stepped up with my rapier and my dagger in my hand

With a bride upon his arm
I stood and gazed upon him
As though he were a charm

Once he smiled upon her
And once he smiled on me
But they knew not what I suffered
For they found no change in me

I'll be all smiles tonight, love
I'll be all smiles tonight
Though my heart may break tomorrow
I'll be all smiles tonight

The Chieftains,"If on every ocean the ship is a throne 
And for each mast cut down another sapling is grown 
Then I could believe that I`m bound to find 
A better life than I left behind 

But as you ascend the ladder 
Look out below where you tread 
For the colors bled as they overflowed 
Red, white and blue 
Green, white and gold 

So I had to leave from my country of birth 
As for each child grown tall 
Another lies in the earth 
And for every rail we laid in the loam 
There`s a thousand miles of the long journey home 

But as you ascend the ladder 
Look out below where you tread 
For the colors bled as they overflowed

A literal translation by j. mark sugars 1997

Once I was a gentle maiden,
But now I am a spent, worn-out widow,
My consort strongly plowing the waves
Over the hills and far away.

He is my hero, my gallant darling,
He is my caesar, a gallant darling;
I've found neither rest nor fortune
Since my gallant darling went far away.

Every day I am constantly enduring grief,
Weeping nitterly and shedding tears,
Because my lively lad has left me
And no news is told of him - alas!

The cuckoo does not sing cheerfully at noon
And the sound of hounds is not heard in nut-tree woods
Nor summer morning in misty glen
Since my lively boy went away from me.

Noble, proud young horseman,
Youth without gloom, of pleasant countenance,
A swift-moving fist, nimble in a fight,
Slaying the enemy and smiting the strong.

Let a strain be played on musical harps,
And let many quarts be filled on the table,
With high spirit, without fault, without gloom,
That my lion may receive long life and health.

Gallant darling for a while under sorrow,
And ireland completely under black cloacks,
I have found neither rest nor fortune
Since my gallant darling went far away

Both protector and reminder of mortality

Blue sky, green grass, we are still
The mists enfold us gently smelling
Breeze in our ears softly telling
Of the days of light and laughter long ago
They trace us, taste us, touch our hair
Show us a castle and show us to their lair - to their lair
And the rolling moon rocks on by
We dance until we start to cry
We've got feverish sweat and aching bones
But please oh God, don't take us home.
It's pretty cool but we can't rest
The purple sun sets in the west
We prance on gold - red summer lawns
Dragons-blood evening, the buzz of swarms
Of lawnmowers mowing summer lawns away, far away,
I realise we really are quite far away, far away,
Far away, far away
And the rolling moon rocks on by
We dance until we start to cry
We've got feverish sweat and aching bones
But please oh God, don't take us home
Please oh God, don't take us home
Please oh God, don't take us home.

Time flies quitely,
Soft warm felt close by,
I lie here quite still,
It's a thrill.

She,
Who sleeps alongside,
A stranger last week,
Is part of my life,
I look at her with just one single sheaf of colour,
Sunlight playes above her,
Will she stay and share some double summer?
Live never tires of great surprises,
Love may have touched us here,
And summers in the air,
Everywhere.

She,
Seems very like me,
The longer we spoke
The more I could see,
If we were to join our forces
And combine resources,
We could share the summer,
And enjoy its deeper secrets,
Life never tires of great suprises,
Love may have touched us here, 
With something we can share

And some sometimes I hear distant thunder,
Troubles bubbling under,
And I start to wonder,
Maybe she will crack my concerns till they scatter like dust?
Not a thing in this world would be stronger than us.
If she said that she'd stay,
I forever would treasure her trust,
For that's enough.

But maybe these are flights of fancy,
When she wakes she'll leave me, 
But then I see her watching -
And she's smiling,
Life has the strangest way of saying:
Love will occur here now.

Love grows, but not when you're absent

How could it change from what it was so quickly to what
It is now?

Dies in the shadow 'neath the corporate vulture

And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the Snowman is a fairytale they say
He was made of snow but the children know
How he came to life one day

There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Frosty the Snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me, come on

Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go
Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow

Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go
Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow

Oh Frosty the Snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, ""Let's run and we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away""

Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there, all around the square
Sayin', ""Catch me if you can!""

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment
When he heard him holler, ""Stop!""

Hey, Frosty the Snowman had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye, sayin', ""Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day""

Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go
Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow

He'll be back, yes he will, again someday
See you next year Frosty!",Frosty the Snowman

The Chipmunks,"Hey, Dave, 'twas the night before Christmas we'll go!
Hi, boys, here I go!

'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;
One, two, three, four, no, Dave, don't we wanna hear some more!

The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;
And mama in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had settled our heads for a long winter's nap,
When out on the lawn there a rose such a clatter,
I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.

Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.
The moon outside was shining on the snow
When the look will right on the ground below,
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer,

With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.
More faster than eagles the reindeer came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name;

""Now, Dasher! Now, Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen!
On, Comet! On Cupid! On, Donder and Blitzen!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!""

And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my hand, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.
He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.

His eyes, how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
His cute little mouth was just like a bow,
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow;

He had a broad face and a little round belly,
That shook, like a bowlful of jelly.
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,
""Merry Christmas to all, and good-night.""",The Night Before Christmas
The Chipmunks,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way

He knows if you've been bad or good

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Now, what did Dr Doolittle wanna do with the animals
More than anything else, Alvin?
He wanted to learn to talk to them
And who promised to teach him how to talk to the animals, Simon?
Polynesia the parrot

Okay now, Theodore
Do you think you remember the song the doctor sang?
Ah, sure I can, if you help me
Okay Theodore, I'll start it out for you

If I could talk to the animals, just imagine it
Chatting with the chimp in chimpanzee
Imagine talking to a tiger, chatting with a cheetah
What a neat achievement it would be

If we could talk to the animals, learn their languages
Maybe take an animal degree
I'd study elephants and eagle, buffalo and beagle
Alligator, guinea pig and flea

I would converse in polar bear and python
I could converse in fluent kangaroo
If people asked me, ""Can you speak rhinoceros?""
I'd say, ""Of courserous, can't you?""

If I conferred with our furry friends, man to animal
Think of the amazing repartee
If I could walk with the animals, talk with the animals
Grunt and squeak, and squawk with the animals
And they could talk to me

If I consulted with quadrupeds
Think what fun we’d have asking over crocodiles for tea
Or maybe lunch with two or three lions, walruses and sea lions
What a lovely place the world would be

If I spoke slang to orangutans
The advantages any fool on earth can plainly see
Discussing eastern art and dramas with intellectual llamas
That’s a big step forward you’ll agree

I’d learn to speak in antelope and turtle
My Pekinese would be extremely good
If I were asked to sing in hippopotamus
I’d say “Whynotamous?” and would

If I could parlay with pachyderms
It’s a fairy tale worthy of Hans Anderson or Grimm
A man who walks with the animals, talks with the animals
Grunts and squeaks, and squawks with the animals
And they could talk to him

I’d study every living creature’s language
So you could speak to all of them on site
If friends said, “Can he talk in crab or pelican?”
Then I'd say, “Well, I can” and I’d be right

And if you just stop and think a bit
There's no doubt of it we would win a place in history
If I could walk with the animals, talk with the animals
Grunt and squeak, and squawk with the animals
And they could squeak and squawk, and speak and talk to me

Alright fellas, I understand that's enough

Saturday night and the moon is out. 
I wanna head on over to the Twist and Shout,
find a two-step partner and a cajun beat, 
when it lifts me up, I'm gonna find my feet
out in the middle of a big dance floor.
When I hear that fiddle, wanna beg for more.
Wanna dance to a band from a Lousian' tonight.
 
And I never have wandered down to New Orleans,
never have drifted down a bayou stream.
But I heard that music on the radio,
and I swore someday I was gonna go:
down a highway 10 past Lafayett;
there's a Baton Rouge.
and I won't forget to send you a card with my regrets
'cause I'm never gonna come back home.

The Chipmunks,"Well, I woke up this morning, stumbled out of my rack.
I opened up the paper to the page in the back.
It only took me a minute for my finger to find 
my daily dose of destiny under my sigh.
My eyes just about popped out-a my head. 
It said,""The starts are stacked against you, girl. Get back in bed.""
 
I feel lucky,
I feel lucky, Yeah.
No Professor Doom gonna stand in my way.
Mm, I feel lucky today.
 
Well, I strolled down to the corner, gave my numbers to the clerk.
The pot's eleven million, so I called in sick to work.
I bought a pack of Camels, a burrito and a Barq's 
crossed against the light made a beeline for the park.
The sky began to thunder, the wind began to moan.
I heard a voice above me sayin', ""Girl, you'd better get back home.""
 
I feel lucky, 
I feel lucky, yeah.
No tropical depression gonna steal my sun away.
Mm, I feel lucky today.
 
Now Eleven million later, I was sittin' at the bar.
I bought the house a double, then the waitress a new car.
Dwight Yoakim's in the corner, try'n' to catch my eye.
Lyle Lovett's right beside me with his hand upon my thigh.
The moral of this story, it's simple but it's true:
Hey, the stars might lie, but the numbers never do.
 
I feel lucky, 
I feel lucky, yeah.
Hey Dwight, hey Lyle, boys, you don't have to fight.

In a basso rich and deep,
Crooning soft and low

As he swings back and forward in his saddle
On his horse (a pretty good horse)
Who is syncopated gaited
And with such a funny meter
To the roar of his repeater

How they run when they hear the feller's gun

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

The Choir,"When I met him on a sidewalk
He was preaching to a mailbox
Down on 16th Avenue
And he told me he was Jesus
Sent from Jupiter to free us
With a bottle of tequila and one shoe

He raged about repentance
He finished every sentence
With a promise that the end was close at hand
I didn't even try to understand

He left me wide eyed in disbelief and disillusion
I was tongue tied, drawn by my conclusions
So I turned and walked away
And laughed at what he had to say
Then casually dismissed him as a fraud
I forgot he was created in the image of my God

When I met her in a bookstore
She was browsing on the first floor
Through a yoga magazine
And she told me in her past life
She was some plantation slave's wife
She had to figure out what that might mean

She believes the healing powers of her crystals
Can bring balance and new purpose to her life
Sounds nice

She left me wide eyed in disbelief and disillusion
I was tongue tied, drawn by my conclusions
So I turned and walked away
And laughed at what she had to say
Then casually dismissed her as a fraud
I forgot she was created in the image of my God

Not so long ago, a man from Galilee
Fed thousands with His bread and His theology
And the truth He spoke, quickly became the joke of educated
Self-inflated Pharisees like me

And they were wide eyed in disbelief and disillusion
They were tongue tied, drawn by their conclusions
Would I have turned and walked away
And laughed at what He had to say
And casually dismissed Him as a fraud
Unaware that I was staring at the image of my God

And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light

English Version:

    1 Have mercy upon me, O God, after thy great goodness : according to the multitude of thy mercies do away mine offences. 

    2 Wash me throughly from my wickedness : and cleanse me from my sin. 

    3 For I acknowledge my faults : and my sin is ever before me. 

    4 Against thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight : that thou mightest be justified in thy saying, and clear when thou art judged. 

    5 Behold, I was shapen in wickedness : and in sin hath my mother conceived me. 

    6 But lo, thou requirest truth in the inward parts: and shalt make me to understand wisdom secretly. 

    7 Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean : thou shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. 

    8 Thou shalt make me hear of joy and gladness : that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice. 

    9 Turn thy face from my sins : and put out all my misdeeds. 

    10 Make me a clean heart, O God : and renew a right spirit within me. 

    11 Cast me not away from thy presence : and take not thy holy Spirit from me. 

    12 O give me the comfort of thy help again : and stablish me with thy free Spirit. 

    13 Then shall I teach thy ways unto the wicked : and sinners shall be converted unto thee. 

    14 Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou that art the God of my health : and my tongue shall sing of thy righteousness. 

    15 Thou shalt open my lips, O Lord : and my mouth shall shew thy praise. 

    16 For thou desirest no sacrifice, else would I give it thee : but thou delightest not in burnt-offerings. 

    17 The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit : a broken and contrite heart, O God, shalt thou not despise. 

    18 O be favourable and gracious unto Sion : build thou the walls of Jerusalem. 

    19 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness, with the burnt-offerings and oblations : then shall they offer young bullocks upon thine altar. ","Miserere mei Deus (Psalm 51), motet for chorus"

And she said you were in town
Suddenly the memories came back to me 
In my mind

How can I be strong I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

A wounded heart you gave
My soul you took away
Good intentions you had many
I know you did

I come from a place that hurts
And God knows how I've cried
And I never want to return
never fall again

Making love to you
Oh it felt so good and
Oh so right

How can I be strong I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

So here we are alone again'
Didn't think it'd come to this
And to know it all began
With just a little kiss

I've come too close to happiness
To have it swept away
Don't think I can take the pain
No never fall again

Kinda late in the game and my heart is in
Your hands
Don't you stand there and then
Tell me you love
Me then leave again
Cause I'm falling in love with
You again

Hold me
Hold me
Don't ever let me go
Say it just one time
Say you love me

Something lost among the leaves
Something found along the way
And so begin these empty pages
At the end of a dream
Watch it slowly fade away
The slight of hand the bait and switch
All the parlor tricks have been played on me
I've seen them come and watched them go
Into the night down a road of stone
Beware, oh take care
I guess it takes a thief to know one

And liars live for broken things
Traitors just smile and smile

The poet a poison throne
To rule his kingdom alone
But I'm still singing the blues
Dancing that old soft shoe
I'm still drift'n from cloud to cloud

On the shore I stare
With our people standing there
As our mother floats on by
And as the river took her in
A storm did begin and blew the sky away

I remember you walking through the park
A red scarf
The archer pulls his bow, aims for his mark

This tapestry we weave
Black thread and bright strings on a loom of tears and time
And with the fire all but dead
A cold lays around the bed
As she whispers it’s all a lie, it’s all a lie",Some Gardens Green

The Christians,"  Well hello it's been so long, 
  and I see time has been kind to you. 
  Though we once were handing gloves, 
  You're not the same person I once I knew. 
  Take a good look at yourself, 
  From the frown and despairing eyes, 
  Once were fiery and so bright, 
  Now seem sad and unsatisfied. 

  Wipe the tears from your eyes, 
  And remember you are 

  One in a million, one chosen soul, 
  One in a million, do you wonder what the future holds. 

  Another time another place, 
  And things might have worked out differently, 
  But don't blame the entire human race, 
  For a fault that you can see, 
  Re-inject some self-respect, 
  It's the one thing you must never lose, 
  And with your confidence intact, 
  You've got a second chance, so much to prove, 

  Drop the solemn disguise, 
  And remember you're 

   One in a million, one chosen soul, 
  One in a million, do you wonder what the future holds. 
  One in a million, one shining star, 
  Once in your lifetime,

So much for the things that you say,

As she's starting to crack,
And she can't take much more, no she can't take much more.

How many more times, must they shatter our trust,
Do we sit in silence,or stand up and scream in disgust.

I still have a dream, 
I still have a mind of my own,
They won't take it away,
Because I see the damages they've done.
I see one more boy dies,
One more baby in black,
hear a mother who cries,
But that don't bring him back.

How many times must we stand for their lies,
As the crocodile tears fill their eyes,
The suffering and hardship is not going to fall,

And we need love much more...",One More Baby in Black

For us to learn to live as one,

A dozen times I took you back,

But I must face the facts,
Because there you go again.

I am as trusting as a child,
A helpless fool at your command,
You can be so savage and so wild,

Before the beast returns.

And now you're out of my mind,
And there you go again, a real fairweather friend.

A sadder but a wiser man,
It don't matter what you say,
I've taken all I can.

You won't hurt me so again,

The more I look the less I smile
Never mind let's stay awhile

The fans blow secrets on the night
Out of mind but not out of sight
Is this where you live
Broken voices the nylon choir

Nothing left to stoke that fire
All they own is on their tongues
They never see or wonder if
Is this where you live

Thin dogs don't vie for bones
Why desert just to be alone
All they own is on their backs
They can't believe it's you I'm with

Is this where you live
Don't blush as I brush your touch
No need for any speed or rush
All you own is on the floor

I'm buying all you're gonna give
Is this where you live

Electric lights don't help my youth

All I owned is on my face
Urbane mirror anger myth

The Church,"Last year today seemed a long way away
And ahead of me
A new face and street, people who meet you
Instead of me
They bring you, they take you
They own you, they make you

Last year today you turn and you say
Here's a dream for me
You close your eyes, the moon starts to rise
And you scream for me
I calm you, I'm with you
What did they ever give you

Memories in future tense
Memories don't make much sense

Last year today a radio plays
Such a simple song
The music surreal and you almost could feel
That there's nothing wrong
They bought you, they sold you
And all the things they told you",Memories in Future Tense
The Church,"Anna sits beside her research
Silence in the dappled moonlight
Sleeping cat and dying fire
Embers of the past conspire

All her books are closed and scattered 
And she feels that nothing matters to her
Outside this dream her sister frequents
Like a cobweb catching fragments

She approaches like a vision
She says ""Anna, do you hear me?
But the picture's always shuttered
All the distant thoughts that flutter to her

I can see them all, I can hear them call
And as she falls I lean to say goodbye
Breathing all the wasted hours
Talking to the dying flowers

Dwarfed by spires and tangled towers
We don't ask the reason why
Anna comes and goes in shadows
Paintings of the open windows

Her photograph is always faded
Her sister's eyes are blank and shaded
Don't you understand her science
Merging in a strange alliance to her

We're together in the future
You and I and her together
All our fated are intermingled
We are plural, we are single

We are leaving for a meeting
And last seen the weather sleeting for her",Sisters

Then they just believe in that they can perceive

Just to tell you I care
And I've wanted so long, to tear this all away
Tear it all away

People say well you just had to be there
And all the time you know they've never been there
And it makes me sad to sit and think
Of all those empty souls nearly at the brink
Ah, but I'm trying so hard
Just to keep to myself
The things that I hope will tear it all away
Tear it all away

People grow up and learn to drive some car
But I did that and it doesn't get you far
The things you want are never to be found
And in the end it's all some running round
Ah, but I'm trying so hard
Just to open my eyes
To seeing some things that tear it all away
Tear it all away

I thought you would know
I thought you would know
People say they think that they are sure
But they turn away and don't go back no more
What they saw was not a perfect sight

Morning streaked on a perspex screen
The screaming beaked blackbirds peck
The wrecked eyes of last week's lies

He tries to weep for the grown-up things
One last peep for policemen
A'resting in the woodland side so steep

Oh and I hope I'm not going too fast for you
And don't believe it when they say it's over

That their jokes don't make me laugh
They only make me feel like dying
In an unguarded moment

So long, long between mirages
I knew you'd find me drinking
Tell those men with horses for hearts
That their jibes don't make me bleed
They only make me feel like shrinking
In an unguarded moment

So deep, deep without a meaning

Someone, somewhere must have talked some sense
I could feel it moving underground
So many things I still don't understand

I don't know if I was walking through heaven
It could have been any place
Skipping 'cross the water, wading through the sand
Awake to find you gone, emptiness is where you lay
I just had to smile for all the things you'll never hear me say
Oh, I know, I could never get that near

Can't you see, like the trees so obviously...
The message disturbs me so I throw it to the wind
And after all the hellos goodbyes etc etc

It's like the fog you walk towards, but never seem to reach
Every morning now I hear that same old song
And though the singer is long dead, his voice goes on and on
Ugliness you have to learn, but beauty you can't teach
Awake to find you gone, a note pinned to my sleeve

It was the things you had to leave

Seven long nights to think
A handful of words, a sleeveful of birds
Casually left on the sink

Crimson beads, cut out your needs
Leave you feeling more in the pink
Seven long nights at a pre-announced site
A head on my shoulders and I feel all right

Alter the courses, stand near my flames
Questionable sources, only dropping names
Dropping names
I taught her how to be hard or soft

She never really needed to learn
A trip into town, defenses are down
I never ever need to return
She holds me by the stars, says look at these scars

Seven long days but I can't change my ways
Look over my shoulder and I say hey hey",Dropping Names

As I stand before the relics
Of what used to be you and me
You turn with the tears in your eyes
Not understanding that you are free
Free of me
Like songs, our warmth fades away
Turns into coldness
Like the words that we say, today
And as the city glows, electric people nobody knows
Electric dreams, nobody knows
When you touch my skin, the feeling is electric
I hoped that our destiny sloped
Ever upwards, now it curves away
And falls, like rain
And the windows of children
I see the future, just sliding away, and false",Electric

Fills my head with light

Falling from a height

Only one thing you ever really know
If it's day or night

Our eyes meet and I love her
I suspect she already knows
How those eyes see me so very very clearly
Even when they're closed

The electric lash of trees in the studio
A bite then a caress
Only the voice of the girl on the radio
Drifting from the west
I turn to leave as if in a cameo

You might curse before you bless",Electric Lash

Touch you as the air is turning cold
Another place I look for you
The heights above an almost perfect view

Seeing things just rest a while
As the tide sweeps out another mile
Inside the man, the pleasure dome
This is the world that I once called home

Strangers in their naked skin
Waiting for their sweet oblivion
Close to you, hear all you say
Even though you're continents away

Shrug your shoulders and they disappear

Take all the things I've bought you, leave all the rest alone
Marble skins turn human, people fade to gray
Put your head into my hands we'll make them go away
As you're crying softly, you won't ever be disturbed
Red on pink, the sun will sink, have you even heard?
And the colors take me down
It's no reason to be sad
And you leave without a sound
It's no reason to be glad
Salty tears are wasted, children lie awake
Put your head into my hands, don't let your spirit break
Black smoke from the chimneys, white smoke from the hills
Everything is moving, but we're standing still
Celebrations fading, boats upon the waves
Put your head into my hands, trying to be brave

In the second of honor, a despair sharp and old
She gives me a taste, please show me some etiquette
I wasn't looking for you and I don't want to find you yet

At an uncurtained window, in a street full of rooms
Watching the gardens, and pursuing the blooms
This world is so white, they never see me anymore
But I trusted you then, and I'm trusting you still

It's just that I'm not quite sure
Now I wonder why, I thought I could ever lose
But the gain is hardly what I'd choose
Now I wonder why

It was somebody, a woman, it was a delicate crime
And I've been waiting for ages, yes I've been here all the time
There was this greed in my blood, she let me take the easy way
She helps me hide the vagabond, that was myself yesterday

And after the acting, I found that I couldn't sleep
And during my drifting, I found that I was too deep
By the virtue of faith
I knew that I could be lost

Beyond this dark place
Unprepared to pay the cost",Now I Wonder Why
The Church,"Tell me, is everything unplanned?
It's all so unexpected that I just can't understand
We run so hard and always end up in the same place
""Glad that went so smoothly"" well that never is the case
One day the darkest cloud is bright
Who will shake away the shadows of eternal night
It's just the storm before the calm
Like the life held in your palm - it's clay, one day
And you stand there, with ashes blowing past
Dipping into gilt-edged love that will be made at last
And the gold you spend and the hastening end
That you throw into the sea
Coming back a hundredfold, there's no guarantee
We'll walk and be like giants, we'll all be honest men
I go back to my blindness so that I may see again
A woman standing on a hill is gazing out to sea
Dreaming of a new age waiting there for me
I call her from a distance and she smiles into the sun
And men and gods begin their dance, for their time has begun
And holy wars extended and battlefields of pain
Washed away, forgotten in the perfect rain
Princes, kings and humble things are well-worn and content
Messengers come everywhere, envoys have been sent

And scoured the dreaming valleys
On days where shadows melt

And dust was my companion
And thirst caked all our words
Unearthing nearly nothing
We swarmed like carrion birds
Some for fortune, some for greed
Some for want, some for need
But you could only find yourself that way

In hands numb with jealousy
Sleepwalking lightning showers
Transform effortlessly

Or as bad as I feared

Ripped and raw, lays his glove on the door
Walks in and tells the man on the floor
Maybe these boys want to do some talking
Your room's a mess, it's ugliness
But I go on living in it till you say yes
The curtains are new, but the windows are old
All the stories passing through already been told
We live in a style where trust is a drag
To hold up your end means the middle will sag
Some blackhearted actors interfered in your scene

You're the only one who's forgotten his face

And you go so slow hope they'll ask you to stay
But indifference gives you a fright
Walking outside you come to a door
You go inside and you wonder what for
At least it's good to be out of the wind
You turn around and the clocks all begin
Just like the winter your memory thaws
Just like the ocean your memory pours
So many pieces to match or to find
So many doubts to have in one mind
It's hard to see how the tables have turned
It's hard to see how the people have learned
It's hard to watch the past drizzling past
It's hard to watch them picking the cast
And it stacks up badly that it never makes sense

Hear the difference between close and near
The way oaths and oafs interfere
Bliss comes first as a jangling flood
Pillow from the old country arrives with a thud
That night she drinks ceremony and mud it's
Happening I say

Must be thirsty, drink, drink, sink, forget
Must be empty inside the shadow cabinet

She offered her chaos to me
Proffered herself languidly
The eldritch bitch must have muddled her spells
Tinges of Persia, I hope that it sells
Chemical nuptials and ringing the bells

The empty streets of violet town

Oh Fraulein, that was you
Your phone would ring and ring and ring
The shadows on the beat
The car abandoned long before, when I was free
A message crumpled said something
Yet the language was unknown
Are old mistakes forgotten just like me
She said she's leaving with the crowds
She wants to throw this all away
She said I'm thinking this out loud
That's what I thought you'd say
One night I saw all this

The push and the throb, the threat of the mob
The crack's not a secret this time
The mouths and the doors, now I can't shut anymore
Keep running, you're falling behind
The world spins alone, the weight of it groans
I get dizzy just turning the page
The air holds us down and we're stuck on the ground
Trying to slip off our age
Come to the window come to the door
Given under my hand given under the law
I gave you everything you still want more
They gave you some mad forgotten war
Now it's time to slow things down
Because I told you life speeds up
Tell me how it happened did it hurt did you cry
Did you ever feel yourself falling out of the sky
Did you ever lie awake and wonder why
Did you ever fall asleep and dream that you died

And on her lap the road went on and on
As she dresses I look to the ground
Perhaps I know where the place can be found, and on
Outside, the night is very soft, but where does it end
We'd pile into the Buick, but you've got to have money for that

To justify what we've been through
Logic is fine and science can be kind
But it can't define me and you
Yet I thought I had something special to say
But this nightmarish world
Makes you throw your thoughts away
As though I was someone special today
We say why are the innocent bleeding
Is there not a thing we can do
They say please swallow this trust we are feeding
And don't worry, it's bad for you
Now it's been a long show and I thought you should know
It's time for us to play our hand
But words are much too slow they lost meaning years ago
Isn't that how this began
Some say now! The truth is before us
Others say oh no this is not real
Some say be cruel then they'll adore you
Others say you can't touch till you feel

The Church,"Sometimes I'm wondering under prehistoric skies.
I feel it's all beginning right before my eyes.
I must go back, reexamine my love.
Here she comes with the penetrated stare.

I don't know when, but I wish I knew where.
Quick calculation, there's not nearly enough.
Because we're lost, because we're lost.
Cold desert stars, feel them sparkle and frost,
They are so lost.

Follow her down to worship some god.
Who never speaks to me, I wonder if that's odd.
Then he says you're never listening.
The pursuit of adulation is your butter and your bread.

It's an exquisite corpse and its lips are red
And its teeth are glistening.
But you are lost, but you are lost.
Now hang up 'cause the lines are all crossed,
You are so lost.

If you're alone and you're feeling blue,
Everyone in Persia probably feels like that too.
I just hope they don't believe like you do.
Here she comes with her unforgiving web.

Almost forever I've been drinking these dregs.
It must be time to change our brew, cruel, view.

The Church,"Shaded crystal water, bathed in by God's daughter.
Sighing whispers near, a new season passes here.
Sensory gifts to all who come
Soak up the stars and setting sun.
It's strange and wilder, ageless bechilder
Saved by fire, touched and finer.
Gray stands the tower in the distance.
Days pass like warm sun on the face.
A new season.
Shared is the cure to conquer lonliness.
It's strange and wilder, ageless bechilder
Saved by fire, touched and finer.
Peaceful, blissful union is the priestess.
Doubt flows the river into darkness.

I see you slither away with your skin and your tail,
Your flickering tongue and your rattling scales
Like a real reptile.

Had you coiled around my arm.
How could you ever know
How I loved your diamond eyes?

The Church,"We all came back from the war
 I wish somebody would tell me the score
 We raked old Poseidon over the coals
 Shook his shells, shaked his shoals
 Where can a soldier fix himself a drink
 Forget the noise, forget the stink
 And the opium is running pretty low
 'Cause when the pain comes back, I don't want to know
 Across yonder ocean the natives are fierce
 Their ears are filled their teeth are pierced
 But it's not their spears that spill your breath
 They kill their enemies by loving them to death
 We were on some battlefield
 I felt something soft go through my shield
 I felt something warm enter my guts
 I was bleeding bad but there were no cuts
 They captured three of us, took us back to their village
 After a long long time I could decipher their language
 They worshiped Baal, they worshiped the sun
 They worshiped the son of the evil one
 They were more than voracious, they sucked our ambition
 They let me go on one condition
 That was when I came back to my native shore
 I tell you they don't want to play with us anymore
 But a part of me will never be free
 And the part that's free will never be me
 But a thing of love and beauty is in my head
 A message from my enemies, and here's what they said
 They said that love = hate
 And death = fate
 An enemy always = an adorer
 But priest = aura
 And life = time
 And time = space
 And space = sublime
 And human = race
 Oh and woman = man
 And pot = pan

When the peoples guard is down
On a day like today
Overcast and gray

The birds stopped their singing

He alights from the platform
In his usual uniform
His skin looks like he slept in it
Or had something rotten kept in it
And snakes stir in the thistles
Back of cats neck bristles
Round vicious lips the fur is stained
The disillusionist is back again
They say that he's famous from the waist down
But the top half of his body is a corpse
His gold won't buy him sleep
His poverty runs so deep
In winter he cracks, in summer he warps

Hang around the backstage door
But he knows what you're waiting for
You rub yourself against his fame
Already ready to bear the blame
He asks you ""Did you like my show?""
As if he really wants to know
Then doesn't wait for your reply
He just pulls you back inside

Undress you incidentally
Down the swaying corridor
People you feel sorry for
But when he puts the gaze on you
You're amazed at what you'll let him do

He can turn wine into water
Mother against daughter
Juggles busy deadlines
Gets himself off headlines
Surrounded by his minions
Who never have opinions
Performing little tricks for you
Puts it in a fix for you
Smashes your watch with a hammer
Caresses you with camera
And says the magic words
That nobody's ever heard
Now the slur is fading
Reality all-pervading
It only makes you want him more
It only makes you fawn him more

And he does the Indian rope trick
The one that makes you seasick
And he keeps on filling up your cup
But you keep on filling up
And some of it's done with mirrors
And some of it's done with scissors
And some of it's done with cables
And his hands under the table
It doesn't matter you want to believe
It doesn't matter if you have to leave
You won't escape his orbit
And the things that you must forfeit
And the audience seems familiar
Some of them in particular
Bet you they are his plants
When he plays the game of chance
He reads the minds of jilted girls
And the story really unfurls

 But barbarians came and set fire to their home
 Exposed the dome dwellers to the outside
 They must have known it was the end
 All of their wealth couldn't save them
 All died inside the flames
 Destined to make that same old mistake

A certain flash, a certain light
Abandoning the afternoon as it sinks into the night

I hear a mandolin and hear the springs
Out the wardrobe floats the hint of a rumour
Dressed in your blue velvet finest things
Can you hear the voices that I constantly talk of
Am I the only one to succumb to their rule
Well, I know the form that it's taking
It's not making sense anymore
They way you say you just want to help me
The way your clinging is slinging me under
The strength I need already denied me
Your big ideas and your ideas and your little wonder

Some people don't come over because of my problem
I heard the top guy won't answer his phone
I wonder if he has the same kind of problem
Little difficulty of his own

Or maybe I'll try to fly
No reservations, I'll see how it feels
When I'm over your house, up in the sky
And when the sun is squeezing through the blinds
You will be far away
Deep afternoons see the moon in the shadows
Deep in your dream, I hear you say

Flowing down a crowded street

In another life
I'm not sure what he said
And could it be that he still thinks you're his wife

 I've been waiting, waiting for you
 I'm still waiting, if you remember me
 I'll be waiting, waiting for you
Drink and sing on a desert wind behind here

But who they they left and what they thought they stayed for
Is crumbled in their life's dusty caress
They were so blind
They were so blind
Hiding in a hotel room
Somewhere in the west
I heard they brought a priest in to sanctify the place
But it remained unblessed
Things move around
My guitar sometimes plays itself
They say it's static electricity but
Yesterday it took twenty dollars off the shelf
There's a young man here, says, May or June, another town
The children cry and ask where their mother is
Gonna have to let them down
I've been hurt... I've been around
 I've been waiting seems like eternity
 I've been waiting, waiting for you
 I'm still waiting, if you remember me
 I'll be waiting, waiting for you
Lifted shelves are fading in the valley
Where once the sea had strength enough to reach
And out of twisted metal I've discarded for Gaea's curse

They were blind
They were so blind
They were so blind

Irrigated deserts, built giant golden thrones
Built palaces in India and a dome on the moon
Illustrated ceilings, praised God with strange choirs
Fed the five thousand, built cities of spires
Felt the pull of science unravel in their minds
Charted celestial bodies and were punished for their finds
Conquered snow-peaked mountains, drove jungles to retreat
Were drowned in vicious rapids and were heralded for their feats

Fantasized in Babylon, built a home in space
Scaled the walls of China against all human odds
Won battles without hope and saw men turned into gods


Still they hide their faces well unbetrayed by Heaven or Hell
Only traces to be found although their history resounds
Disconnected they displayed all the discoveries they made
And now they wander round the earth beyond the realms of death or birth
If you look you'll see them there like clouds hanging in the air
And they said the earth was flat, sailed off the world into a vat
Turned the planets into toys then played marbles like small boys

But the Earth cannot recoil
If only the oceans would boil
If only the sky could cry black rain

Lou is searching for morphine
Next stop is Louisiana

Coming home finding other men in hiding
Biding her lonely weekends

He got a chocolate on his eiderdown
Staring out over roofs at the cross
Suppose he must have felt somewhat at loss

This is it, oh, this is it
This is it, oh baby, this is it

You couldn't say he was feeling very vibed
What had the quack in London prescribed
You couldn't really say he seemed to care
Sometimes he acted like he wasn't anywhere

This is it, oh baby, this is it
This it it, oh, this is it

Watching films before it start to crash
Even though you've got a fistful of cash
Watching the future it bursts on through
I was one of those who used to envy you

I knew a wise man didn't know a thing
I knew a happy man who made me feel sad
You never know what the other guy is thinking, too bad

Sometimes you come upon a fork in the road
What was waiting there he never could have known
Split-second difference, one tiny percent
Yeah, he came and he went

The Church,"I heard about Maria, she hated the rat race
And she escaped to a beautiful place
Birds of neo-paradise groove in the trees
The name of her town is Tranquility

Protected by her mantra
Following the formula
In the sun thy will be done

And chasing her rainbows
Talking with the animals
Who say,""You see, it's Tranquility""

Under shifting dimensions horizon returns
Smoke in the distance as Babylon burns
Summer in the river scattering the net
Long to remember that hasn't happened yet

Protected by her mantra
Following the orchestra
In the sun thy will be done

Chasing her rainbows
Talking with the animals
Who say, ""You see, it's Tranquility""

Protected by her mantra
Following the nebula
In the sun thy will be done

Chasing her rainbows

There's no more smooth just rough
Don't go looking for me

Soothes the earth at the end of the day

The Church,"Now that it's over I find myself leaving
The sound permeate in all directions at once
I never said goodbye to the family, lovers
Brothers and daughters, the rest of the bunch

It seems so strange that the things I was chasing
Have all evaporated like a distant dream
Petty ambition, petty obstruction
Something in between

After the after everything
After the after everything now this

Here is a child playing in a garden
Here is an old man with a broken heart
Here comes a train to take you away
It all goes round and round and comes back to the start

I was never really sure what I was waiting for
When the moment came I was looking away
Obsessed with a past, scared of the future
Never took the time to be here today

After the after everything
After everything now this

After everything now this happens
It's not a grand illusion, it's a stupid little trick
The show must go on, these people have paid
You're standing in the wings feeling kinda sick

Never really sure what you were waiting for
When the moment came you just couldn't choose
The fog sweeps down over the marine city
Standing backstage trying to pull on your shoes

After the everything now this

It calls the choirboys from their tea
And villagers, the two or three
Damp down the kitchen fire

Let out the cat, and up the lane
Go paddling through the gentle rain
Of misty Oxfordshire

On country morning sharp and clear
The penitent in faith draw near
And kneeling here below
And kneeling here below

Partake the heavenly banquet spread
Of sacramental wine and bread
And Jesus presence know
And Jesus presence know

And must that plaintive bell in vain
Plead loud along the dripping lane?
And must the building fall?

The City,"With the music of life, my soul is out of tune,
And I feel like I'm growing old much too soon,
My love for you, I just couldn't convey,
And the keys to my happiness, I let slip away.
Now I'm a man without a dream,
I've got a heart that has no hope,
All my senses are numb,
Losing you, I've become,
A man (I'm just a man) without a dream.
Instead of striving to reach my goals and my aims
I got distracted with meaningless games,
For just an illusion, I traded love that was real,
Now my eyes cannot see and my heart cannot feel.
Now I'm a man without a dream,
I've got a heart that has no hope,
All my senses are numb,
Losing you, I've become,
A man (I'm just a man) without a dream.
Sometimes I think I'm a prisoner of fate,
Doomed to find out things a little too late,
And so I must play this broken man's role,
Unless you come home, girl, and bring back my soul.
'Cause I'm a man without a dream,
I've got a heart that has no hope,
All my senses are numb,
Losing you, I've become,
A man (I'm just a man) without a dream,
Without a dream,
Without a dream.

Who think youth can be found in a fountain

But she'll never dance with them.
And in smoke filled rooms of electric sound
A legend is built around the snow queen
You may believe you're a winner
But with her you will soon bite the dust 
And discover you're just a beginner
You may not think you're a loser, but in midair
You'll be hung while you trip on your tongue
And it'll only amuse her
In the morning haze you are frozen there
Caught in the icy stare of the snow queen
No my friend, she doesn't want what you're selling
Go my friend, there must be a place you can hide
And into the night you'll fade, knowing
You lost the game and just how she got

There Ireland's lines of marching men, in squadron passed me by
No pipes did hum or no battle drum did sound its dread tattoo
But, the Angelus bell o'er the Liffey swell, rang out in the Foggy Dew

Right proudly high over Dublin town, they hung out the flag of war
For, 'twas better to die 'neath an Irish sky than at Suvla or Sud El Bar
And from the plains of Royal Meath, strong men came hurrying through
While Brittania's sons with their long range guns, sailed in by the Foggy Dew

'Twas England bade our wild geese go that small nations might be free
But, their lonely graves are by Suvla's waves on the fringe of the grey North Sea
Oh, had they died by Pearse's side, or fought with Valera true
Their graves we'd keep where the Fenians sleep, 'neath the hills of the Foggy Dew

The bravest fell and the sullen bell rang mournfully and clear
For those who died that Easter tide in the springing of the year
And the world did gaze in deep amaze at those fearless men and true
Who bore the fight that freedom's light might shine through the Foggy Dew",The Foggy Dew

Upon his knee a pretty wench
And on the table a jug of punch

Let the doctors come with all their art
They'll make no impression upon my heart
Even the cripple forgets his hunch
When he's snuggled 'side a jug of punch

As over hills and valleys, my true love he did go
It was there he spied a pretty fair maid, with a salt tear in her eye
She had a baby in her arms, and bitter she did cry

""Oh, cruel was my father to bar the door on me
And cruel was my mother, this dreadful crime to see
Cruel was my own true love to change his mind for gold
Cruel was that winter's night that pierced my heart with cold""

Oh, the taller that the palm tree grows, the sweeter is the bark
And the fairer that a young man speaks, the falser is his heart
He will kiss you and embrace you, 'till he thinks he has you won
Then he'll go away and leave you all for some other one

So come all you pretty fair maids, a warning take by me
And never try to build your nest on top of any tree

(P.J.McCall)
At Boulavogue, as the sun was setting
O'er bright May meadows of Shelmalier,
A rebel hand set the heather blazing
And brought the neighbors from far and near.
Then Father Murphy, from old Kilcormack,
Spurred up the rocks with a warning cry;
""Arm! Arm!"" he cried, ""for I've come to lead you,
For Ireland's freedom we fight or die.""
He led us on 'gainst the coming soldiers,
The cowardly Yeomen we put to flight;
'Twas at the Harrow the boys of Wexford
Showed Bookey's regiment how men could fight.
Look out for hirelings, King George of England,
Search every kingdom where breathes a slave,
For Father Murphy of the County Wexford
Sweeps o'er the land like a mighty wave.
We took Camolin and Enniscorthy,
And Wexford storming drove out our foes;
'Twas at Slieve Coillte our pikes were reeking
With the crimson stream of the beaten yeos.
At Tubberneering and Ballyellis
Full many a Hessian lay in his gore;
Ah, Father Murphy, had aid come over,
The green flag floated from shore to shore!
At Vinegar Hill, o'er the pleasant Slaney,
Our heroes vainly stood back to back,
And the Yeos at Tullow took Father Murphy
And burned his body upon the rack.
God grant you glory, brave Father Murphy,
And open Heaven to all your men;
The cause that called you may call tomorrow
In another fight for the green again.

",Boulavogue
The Clancy Brothers,"There was Johnny McEldoo and McGee and me
And a couple of two or three went on the spree one day
We had a bob or two, which we knew how to blew
And the beer and whiskey flew and we all felt gay
We visited McCann's, Maclaman's, Humpty Dan's
We then went into Swan's, our stomachs for to pack
We ordered out a feed, which indeed, we did need
And we finished it with speed, but we still felt slack

Johnny McEldoo turned red, white and blue
As a plate of Irish stew he soon put out of sight
He shouted out ""Encore!"" with a roar for some more
That he'd never felt before such a keen appetite
We ordered eggs and ham, bread and jam, what a cram
But him, we couldn't ram, though we tried our level best
For everything we brought, cold or hot, mattered not
It went down him like a shot and he still stood the test

He swallowed tripe and lard by the yard, we got scarred
We thought it would go hard when the waiter brought the bill
We told him to give o'er, but he swore he could lower
Twice as much again and more before he had his fill
He nearly supped a trough full of broth says McGragh
""He'll devour the tablecloth if you don't hold him in""
When the waiter brought the charge, McEldoo felt so large
He began to shout and barge and his blood went on fire

He began to curse and swear, tear his hair in despair
To finish the affair, called the shop man a liar
The shop man, he through out and no doubt, he did clout
McEldoo he kicked about like an old football
Tattered all his clothes, broke his nose, I suppose
He would have killed him with a few blows in no time at all
Mceldoo began to howl and to growl, by my soul
Through an empty bowl at the shop keepers head
It struck poor Mickey Flynn, took the skin from his chin
An erection did begin and we all fought and bled
The peelers did arrive, man alive, four or five
At us they made a dive for us all to march away
We paid for all the mate that we ate, stood a trait
And went home to ruminate on the spree that day",Johnny McEldoo
The Clancy Brothers,"The minstrel boy to the war is gone
In the ranks of death you'll find him
His father's sword he hath girded on
And his wild harp slung behind him
""Land of Song!"" cried the warrior bard
(Should) ""Tho' all the world betrays thee
One sword, at least, thy rights shall guard
One faithful harp shall praise thee!""
The Minstrel fell! But the foreman's steel
Could not bring that proud soul under
The harp he lov'd ne'er spoke again
For he tore its chords asunder
And said ""No chains shall sully thee
Thou soul of love and brav'ry!
Thy songs were made for the pure and free
They shall never sound in slavery!",The Minstrel Boy
The Clancy Brothers,"I've been a moonshiner for many a year 
And I've spent all me money on whiskey and beer
I'll go to some hollow and I'll set up my still
And I'll make you a gallon for a ten shilling bill

[Chorus:]

I'm a rambler, I'm a gambler, 
I'm a long way from home
And if you don't like me 
You can leave me alone
I'll eat when I'm hungry 
And I'll drink when I'm dry
And if moonshine don't kill me 
I'll live till I die

I'll go to some hollow in this country
Ten gallons of wash and I'll go on a spree
No woman to follow and the world is all mine
I love none so well as I love the moonshine

Moonshine dear moonshine oh how I love thee
You killed my poor father but dare you kill me
Bless all moonshiners and bless all moonshine
For their breath smells as sweet as the dew on the vine",The Moonshiner
The Clancy Brothers,"Of all the money that e'er I spent
I've spent it in good company
And all the harm that ever I did
Alas it was to none but me
And all I've done for want of wit
To memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
If I had money enough to spend
And leisure to sit awhile
There is a fair maid in the town
That sorely has my heart beguiled

Her rosy cheeks and ruby lips
I own she has my heart enthralled
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Oh, all the comrades that e'er I had
They're sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They'd wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and softly call
Good night and joy be with you all",The Parting Glass

Whack fol the diddle all the di do day.
To the land that reigns all lands above.
Whack fol the diddle all the di do day.
May peace and plenty be her share
Who kept our homes from want and care,
God bless Mother England is our prayer.

So we say, Hip Hooray!
Come and listen while we pray.

When we were savage, fierce and wild
She came like a mother to her child.
She gently raised us from the slime
Kept our hands from hellish crime,
And sent us to Heaven in her own good time.
Now our fathers oft were very bad boys.
Guns and pikes are dangerous toys.
From Bearna Baol to Bunker Hill
They made poor England weep her fill,
But ould Brittania loves us still!
Now Irishmen, forget the past!
And think of the time that's coming fast.
When we shall all be civilized,
Neat and clean and well-advised.
And won't Mother England be surprised?",Whack Fol the Diddle
The Clancy Brothers,"I sat within the valley green, I sat me with my true love
My sad heart strove the two between, the old love and the new love
The old for her, the new that made me think on Ireland dearly
While soft the wind blew down the glen and shook the golden barley 

'Twas hard the woeful words to frame to break the ties that bound us
But harder still to bear the shame of foreign chains around us
And so I said, ""The mountain glen I'll seek at morning early
And join the bold united men, while soft winds shake the barley"" 

While sad I kissed away her tears, my fond arms round her flinging
The foeman's shot burst on our ears from out the wildwood ringing
A bullet pierced my true love's side in life's young spring so early
And on my breast in blood she died while soft winds shook the barley 

But blood for blood without remorse I've taken at Oulart Hollow
And laid my true love's clay cold corpse where I full soon may follow
As round her grave I wander drear, noon, night and morning early
With breaking heart when e'er I hear the wind that shakes the barley",The Wind That Shakes the Barley
The Clancy Brothers,"Oh, me name is Dick Darby, I'm a cobbler
I served my time at ould camp
Some call me an old agitator
But now I'm resolved to repent

With me ing-twing of an ing-thing of an i-doe
With me ing-twing of an ing-thing of an i-day
With me roo-boo-boo roo-boo-boo randy
And me lab stone keeps beating away

Now, my father was hung for sheep stealing
My mother was burned for a witch
My sister's a dandy house-keeper
And I'm a mechanical switch

It's forty long years I have traveled
All by the contents of me pack
Me hammers, me awls and me pinchers
I carry them all on me back

Oh, my wife she is humpy, she's lumpy
Me wife she's the devil, she's cracked
And no matter what I may do with her
Her tongue, it goes clickety-clack

It was early one fine summer's morning
A little before it was day
I dipped her three times in the river
And carelessly bade her ""Good day""",The Cobbler
The Clancy Brothers,"One pleasant evening in the month of June
As I was sitting with my glass and spoon
A small bird sat on an ivy bunch
And the song he sang was ""The Jug Of Punch""

What more diversion can a man desire
Than to sit him down by a snug turf fire?
Upon his knee a pretty wench
And on the table a jug of punch

Let the doctors come with all their art
They'll make no impression upon my heart
Even the cripple forgets his hunch
When he's snuggled 'side a jug of punch

And if I get drunk, well the money's me own
And them that don't like me, they can leave me alone
I'll tune me fiddle and I'll rosin me bow
And I'll be welcome wherever I go",The Jug of Punch [Live]

The Clancy Brothers,"Oh list to the lay of a poor Irish harper
And scorn not the strains of his old, withered hands
But remember his fingers, they once could move sharper
To raise up the memory of his dear native land

At a fair or a wake, I could twist my shillelagh
Or trip through a jig with my brogues bound with straw
And all the pretty colleens around me assembled
Loved their bold Phelim Brady, the bard of Armagh

Oh, how I long to muse on the days of my boyhood
But four score and three years have flitted since then
But they bring sweet reflections, as every young joy should
For, the merry hearted boys makes the best of old men

And when sergeant death, in his cold arms shall embrace me
And lull me to sleep with sweet Erin go bragh
By the side of my Kathleen, my young wife then place me
Then forget Phelim Brady, the bard of Armagh",The Bard of Armagh
The Clancy Brothers,"I Know My Love
I know my love by his way of walking,
And I know my love by his way of talking
And I know my love by his suit of blue
And if my love leaves me, what will I do?
Cho: And still she cried:""I love him the best
But a troubled mind, sure, can get no rest.""
And still she cried, ""Bonny boys are few,
And if my love leaves me, what will I do?""
There is a dance house in Maradyke
Where my true love goes every night
And takes a strange one upon his knee
And don't you know, now, that vexes me.
I know my love is an arrant rover
And he'll go roaming the wide world over
In foreign parts he may chance to stray
Where all the girls are so bright and gay,
If my love knew I could wash and wring
If my love knew I could weave and spin
I'd make a dress all of the finest kind
But the want of money leaves me behind.

The Clancy Brothers,"[Chorus]
I'll tell me Ma when I go home, 
The boys won't leave the girls alone
They pull my hair, they stole my comb 
But that's all right till I get home
 
She is handsome, she is pretty, she is the belle of Belfast City
She is a-courtin' one, two, three, please won't you tell me who is she?
Albert Mooney says he loves her, all the boys are fightin' for her
They knock on the door, they ring on the bell, say ""Oh my true love are you well?""
Out she comes as white as snow, rings on her fingers, bells on her toes
Oul Johnny Murray says she'll die if she doesn't get the fellow with the rovin' eye

Let the wind and the rain and the hail blow high and the snow come tumblin' from the sky
She's as nice as apple pie and she'll get her own lad bye and bye
When she gets a lad of her own she won't tell her Ma when she gets home
Let them all come as they will, it's Albert Mooney she loves still

[Chorus]",I'll Tell My Ma
The Clancy Brothers,"While in  the merry month of May from me home I started,
Left the girls of Tuam so sad and broken hearted,
Saluted father dear, kissed me darling mother,
Drank a pint of beer, me grief and tears to smother,
Then off to reap the corn, leave where I was born,
Cut a stout black thorn to banish ghosts and goblins;
Bought a pair of brogues rattling o'er the bogs
And fright'ning all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah !

In Mullingar that night I rested limbs so weary,
Started by daylight next morning blithe and early,
Took a drop of pure to keep me heartfrom sinking;
Thats a Paddy's cure whenever he's on drinking.
See the lassies smile, laughing all the while
At me curious style, 'twould set your heart a bubblin'
Asked me was I hired, wages I required,
I was almost tired of the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah !

In Dublin next arrived, I thought it such a pity
To be soon deprived a view of that fine city.
So then I took a stroll, all among the quality;
Me bundle it was stole, all in a neat locality.
Something crossed me mind, when I looked behind,
No bundle could I find upon me stick a wobblin'
Enquiring for the rogue, they said me Connaught brogue
Wasn't much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah !

From there I got away, me spirits never falling,
Landed on the quay, just as the ship was sailing.
The Captain at me roared, said that no room had he;
When I jumped aboard, a cabin found for Paddy.
Down among the pigs, played some hearty rigs,
Danced some hearty jigs, the water round me bubbling;
When off Holyhead I wished meself was dead,
Or better for instead on the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah !

Well the boys of Liverpool, when we safely landed,
Called meself a fool, I could no longer stand it.
Blood began to boil, temper I was losing;
Poor old Erin's Isle they began abusing.
""Hurrah me soul"" says I, me Shillelagh I let fly.
Some Galway boys were nigh and saw I was a hobble in,
With a load ""hurray !"" joined in the affray.
We quitely cleared the way for the rocky road to Dublin.

The Clancy Brothers,"There was a wild colonial boy, Jack Duggan was his name
He was born and raised in Ireland in a place called Castlemaine
He was his father's only son, his mother's pride and joy
And dearly did his parents love the wild colonial boy

At the early age of sixteen years, he left his native home
And to Australia's sunny shore he was inclined to roam
He robbed the rich, he helped the poor, he shot James McAvoy
A terror to Australia was the wild colonial boy

One morning on the prairie as Jack he rode along
A listening to the mockingbird a singing a cheerful song
Out stepped a band of troopers, Kelly, Davis and Fitzroy
They all set out to capture him, the wild colonial boy

""Surrender now Jack Duggan for you see we're three to one
Surrender in the Queen's high name for you're a plundering son""
Jack pulled two pistols from his belt and he proudly waved them high
""I'll fight, but not surrender,"" said the wild colonial boy

He fired a shot at Kelly, which brought him to the ground
And turning 'round to Davis, he received a fatal wound
A bullet pierced his proud young heart from the pistol of Fitzroy
And that was how they captured him, the wild colonial boy",The Wild Colonial Boy [#]

You can idolize your drum machine, say the Beatles suck and dis the King and walk away
You can finalize the ending, break the rules that you've been bending
You can find a brand new lover, run away and then discover
You can't outrun your actions, you can't get no satisfaction
And if you ever open your eyes, you won't find me standing in line
Caroline, it's a waste of time",Caroline
The Clarks,"It's a late night in this town
It's time to move on
And our time, it came and went
Find your coat, find your keys
Find the man of your dreams
And how much money he spent

So set down your drink
You've had more than you should
Your last chance has just come and gone
Well she's gone for the door
And she looks all alone
Let me know what she looks like at dawn

Last call, again
Last call, do you know where you're going
Last call, again

There are lovers and fighters
at 2:00 AM
A big girl named Carol,
Well she just left with Jim
And it's hard sometimes
To make up your mind
They're out in the lot
And she's going down on him

So roll your leg over
Take the bow not the stern
And pray before you begin
'Cause this date's not your mate
And it's not where you're going
But more like where they've been

Slip a beer in your coat
Keep your arms to your side
'Cause going home,
That's a pretty good drive
Keep it under the dash
And watch who you pass
For your first DWI

The Clarks,"Leave for the country let the day begin
I carry my share of original sin
I'm writing you a letter from a telephone
Sign it messenger man in the great unknown

And I want to be like Mercury
With the wind blowin' through my hair

Swim up the river to the cedar trees
Follow the sun and catch a nice cool breeze
Bicycle trail only runs so far
This is a place you can't get by car

And I want to be like Mercury
With the wind blowin' through my hair

Walk through the woods on a moonlit night
I carry a compass and a small flashlight
Deliver my message in a mason jar
Planting my seeds, they're growing star to star

Well we've both felt lovely, things are going our way
May you rise above me, may you have your day
And I'll be proud of you, when I call out your name
Give back the ruin, give back the rain

And you know it's the only bridge I know that's still above water
I'm praying my insurance is gonna pay
And you know it's the only road I know that's still above water
I'm praying my family is gonna stay

Well we've both been better, or worse I suppose
And I got your letter, and I washed your clothes

When I was more than border line
But who's to blame, emotions somehow get misread
I hate to bring it up again
I won't let go, I can't defend
But what's the use if we, constantly pretend

It should have been me
That made it with you
Sadly all my dreams turned blue
It should have been me 
That made it with you 
But that's not your point of view

You painted me into the corner of your mind

So close the curtain, fade to black

I've been shown up, but I've grown up
And I'm not down, I'm not down

On my own I faced a gang of jeering in strange streets
When my nerves were pumping and I
Fought my fear in, I did not run
I was not done

I've been beat up, I've been thrown out
But I'm not down, I'm not down
I've been shown up, but I've grown up
And I'm not down, I'm not down

And I have lived that kind of day
When one of your sorrows will go away
It goes down and down and hit the floor
Down and down and down some more
Depression
But I now there'll be some way
When I can swing everything back my way
Like skyscrapers rising up
Floor by floor, I'm not giving up

So you rock around and think that
You're the toughest
In the world, the whole wide world
But you're streets away from where
It gets the roughest
You ain't been there

I've been beat up, I've been thrown out
But I'm not down, I'm not down
I've been shown up, but I've grown up
And I'm not down, I'm not down

When top men need a top up long before the happy hour
Your snakeskin suit and your alligator boot
You won't need a launderette, you can take it to the vet!

To dance to the latest hi-fi sound
Of bass, guitar and drum
Seeking out a rhythm that can take the pressure off
Stepping in and out of that crooked crooked beat

Take a piece of cloth, a coin for thirst
For the sweat will start to run
With a cymbal splash, a word of truth
And a rocking bass and drum
Seeking out a rhythm that can take the pressure on
Stepping in and out of that crooked crooked beat

So one by one they come on down
From the tower blocks of my home town
Stepping with the rhythm of the rockers beat
Drowning out the pressure of the crooked beat
Seeking out a rhythm that can take the tension on
Stepping in and out of that crooked crooked beat

Where cars patrol this crooked beat

I dreamed as I slept, I could see the campfires,
A song of the battle, that was born in the flames,
And the rebels were waltzing on air.

I danced with a girl to the tune of a waltz
That was written to be danced on the battlefield
I danced to the tune of a voice of a girl
A voice that called ""Stand till we fall
We stand till all the boys fall.""

As we danced came the news that the war was not won
5 armies were coming, with carrige and gun
Through the heart of the camp
Swept the news from the front
A cloud crossed the moon, a child cried for food
We knew the war could not be won.

So we danced with a rifle, to the rhythm of the gun
In a glade through the trees I saw my only one
Then the earth seemed to rise hell hot as the sun
The soldiers were dying, there was tune to the sighing.
The song was an old rebel one.

As the smoke of our hopes rose high from the field
My eyes played tricks through the moon and the trees
I slept as I dreamed I saw the army rise
A voice began to call, stand till you fall
The tune was an old rebel one.",Rebel Waltz

And the clouds are high in Spanish mountains
And a Ford roars through the night full of rain

Did anyone prophesize these people?
Only Travis
Come in, Travis
""All the animals come out at night
Queens, fairies, dopers, junkies, sick, venal (who got shot tonight?)
Some day a real rain will come and wash all the scum off the streets""

(Who got shot tonight?) the city knows

""Thank god for the rain to wash the trash off the sidewalk
Listen you screwheads, here is a man who would not take it anymore
A man who stood up against the scum, the filth
Now I see clearly""

Personally I know the alley
Where Jack feeds on the birds of night
Not even bubbies bicycling (two-by-two) can stop the blood and feathers flying

(Who got shot tonight?)
(Who got shot tonight?)
(Who got shot tonight?)

Wearing overalls and for once and for all
What is the dream?
I'll tell it
To live like they do in the movies?
San Juan, you listening?
Yeah, I bet you are
Hands up for Hollywood (hooray!), I hear you
Snappy on the air, hang in there, wall to wall
You saved the world, what else, you saved the girl
Chmpagne on ice, no stranger to Alcatraz to boot
Or strip it down, chop it a little
Being reasonable
Just freedom to move, to live
For women to take a walk in the park at midnight (who got shot tonight?)
Hey, but this is serious, she can't even get back home (who got shot tonight?)

Who shot the shot that popped the cop that chopped the cop and made him drop?

The Clash,"You know he heard the drums of war
When the past was a closing door

The drums beat into the jungle floor

How's about a British jig and reel?

Of the Amerasian blues?
When it's Christmas out in Ho Chi Minh City
Kiddie say papa papa papa papa pappa-san, take me home
See me got

Of you and mamma mamma mamma-san

On the druggy-drag ragtime U.S.A.?
In Parkland International
Ha, junkie-dom U.S.A
Where pro-caine proves the purest rock man groove
And rat poison
The volatile Molotov says

Straight to hell

Can you really cough it up loud and strong?
The immigrants, they wanna sing all night long
It could be anywhere
Most likely could be any frontier any hemisphere
In no-man's-land
There ain't no asylum here
King Solomon he never lived 'round here

Took one of his pills
Boiled the blood in my eyes.

When you played the master mix
To the company man
Took three million worldwide
To make him understand
You don't work for peanuts
But they'll push you too

Bet you ain't had no food now
Since you last went to sleep
The wild seed that was sowed
Will take forever to reap.

What days and nights though
Rocking out of ham yard
Oh skip that fandango
Bring the blues back down hard
Though chuck would never admit it
At the door of the jail
There stood Guy Stevens
And he was waving the bail.

Drop your bombs between the minarets

The Clash,"They say you stand
By your man
Tell me something
I don't understand
You said you loved me
And that's a fact
And then you left me
Said you felt trapped
Well,somethings you can explain away
But the heartache's with me till this day
Did you stand by me
No,not at all
Did you stand by me
No way
All the times
That we were closed
I remember
These things the most
I've seen all our dreams
Come tumblin' down
I can't stay happy
Without you around
So alone I keep the wolves a bay
And there's only one thing I can say
Did you stand by me
No,not at all
Did you stand by me
No way
You must explain
Why this must be
Did you lie
When you spoke to me
Did you stand by me
No,not at all
Now I got a job
But it don't pay
I need new clothes
I need somewhere to stay
But without all these things I can do
But without your love
I won't make it through
Without you love
I won't make it through
But you don't understand my point of view
I suppose there's nothing I can do
Did you stand by me
No,not at all

The Clash,"I want to move the town to the clash city rockers

You better leave town if you only want to knock us

Then you realize that you got to have a purpose
Or this place is gonna knock you out sooner or later

Jack it in forever tonight
Or shut your mouth and pretend you enjoy it
Think of all the money you've got

Or plug into the aerials that poke up in the sky
Or burn down the suburbs with the half-closed eyes

The Clash,"My daddy was a bank robber
But he never hurt nobody

Some is rich, and some is poor
And that's the way the world is

Sayin' how bad your luck is

So he came to jazz it up
Never learned to shovel
Break your back to earn our pay

He just loved to live that way
And he loved to take your money

Said ""I never been in prison
A lifetime serving one machine
Is ten times worse than prison""

Imagine if all the boys in jail
Could get out now together
Whadda you think they'd want to say to us?
While we was being clever

Someday you'll meet your rocking chair
'Cause that's where we're spinning
There's no point to want to comb your hair
When it's grey and thinning

Oh

Hey, my daddy was a bank robber
But he never hurt nobody
He just loved to live that way
And he loved to steal your money

So he came to jazz it up
We never learned to shovel
Break your back to earn your pay
And don't forget to grovel, hey

Get away, get away, get away, get away, get away, get away, get away

It's up to you not to hear the call-up
I don't want to kill!

For he who will die

Maybe I want to see the wheat fields
Over Kiev and down to the sea

All the young people down the ages
They gladly marched off to die
Proud city fathers used to watch them
Tears in their eyes

There is a rose that I want to live for
Although, God knows, I may not have met her
There is a dance an' I should be with her
There is a town - unlike any other

But we didn't want it on the label
They said, ""Fly to Amsterdam""

Come for the party - come to make sure!

Ooh ooh ooh have we done something wrong?
Ooh ooh ooh complete control, even over this song

They said we'd be artistically free

They meant let's make a lotsa mon-ee

He's coming by bus or underground
A woman's eye will shed a tear to see his face so beaten in fear
It's just around the corner in the English civil war
It was still at the stage of clubs and fists
When that well-known face got beaten to bits
Your face was blue in the light of the screen as we watched the speech of an animal scream
The new party army was marching right over our heads
Alright

There you are, ha, ha, I told you so
Says everybody that we know
But who hid a radio under the stairs and who got caught out on their unawares?
When that new party army came marching right up the stairs
When Johnny comes marching home again
Nobody understands it can happen again
The sun is shining and the kids are shouting loud but you gotta know it's shining through a crack in the cloud
The shadows keep falling when Johnny comes marching home
Alright Johnny, okay Johnny, okay John go home, home, home, home
Guess who's catching a plain when Johnny comes running home",English Civil War (Johnny Comes Marching Home)
The Clash,"They cried the tears, they shed the fears

When lightening hits small wonder

No expense accounts, or lunch discounts
Or hypeing up the charts

Comes spilling the words I so desperately needed to hear

Do you know this song's for you?
My heart goes out to the hurt you feel inside

What hurts more than just dying is living barely alive
After all it's easier than falling short every time
I felt the pain and set fire to the grace
That I so desperately needed to take

Like a phoenix birthing wings
And I will fight for my disasters
I will take the flight of kings

And if your life is ever torched
Or if you know the pain I sing
Then will you sing with me this chorus
And we will cut through people's hearts and free them

When your left alone to wonder
How it is someone opens and shuts the door

And I know you're cold but come home
It's a shame how short we all have come

You set your mind on cruise control
Knuckles grip the wheel in fear to let it go
Love is empty, love is cruel
Love, it blindly breaks the rules

How could you have been a fool?
It's something all of us go through
You choke back tears and swallow lies
But those wiper blades won't fix you eyes
Count on having clouded vision for at least a little while

You're the drink in my hand

I left you last week and you told me
""Go on and follow your dreams ""
I think about that lately
But still I don't know what it means

'Cause you're what I dream of when I awake alone
As I drift away, as we talk on the phone
You're all I want and that's all that I know
And I still just can't wait to get home

And I, I am almost nowhere
And I'm getting there fast
And you, you're the hope in my cold stare
You're the drink in my hand

You're the drink in my hand
You're the drink in my hand
You're the drink in my hand

The Classic Crime,"My [Incomprehensible], my life is dull
And dried up like the sound of voice makes
When the heart grows cold and it?s going that way

I think I?ll move out of state somewhere far from
Seattle City lights, they burn my eyes
California sounds nice but California?s a lie
Maybe I'm out of luck or maybe I'm just blind, oh this time

Rain on my hopes, rain on my soul
Rain on everything that I know
It feels so ludicrous, the pursuit of this dream
We thought we?d be there long ago

My life is like a rolling river, so muddy and absurd
And although I might be mistaken I know that I?ll be heard
And I find the second I try to pull away
I'm thrown back in line, oh, this time

So, rain on my hopes, rain on my soul
Rain on everything that I know
It feels so ludicrous, the pursuit of this dream
We thought we?d be there long ago

Rain on my hopes, rain on my soul
Rain on everything that I know
It feels so ludicrous, the pursuit of this dream

And we're all looking for
The same thing, the same thing

Back home, back home, so

And all of the roads look the same in each state that I drove in
As I grip the wheel and I drift away
Wishing I could wake up just a second too late
So, that I could see heaven and I get a taste but I just keep goin'

So, here is to the promise of glamorous living
You must drink up now cause it?s all that you're getting
If you haven't been tested, you certainly will
And I promise it?s going to kill

All I can think of is how much I?d kill to be sleeping
Squinting my eyes my minds drifting to secrets I'm keeping
And the long hauling trucks are all parked in their stops
Just like luminous ghosts of something that once was
The rigs all look so empty when framed by their lights
And that's how I'm feeling

So, here is to the promise of glamorous living
You must drink up now cause it?s all that you're getting
If you haven't been tested, you certainly will
And I promise it?s going to kill

The Classic Crime,"It?s a beautiful landscape
The sunset makes the coast look so clear
It?s the kind that makes your heart break
But no one has those kind of problems here

And from the sage brush comes a dove
It comes to take away the ones you love
In camouflage comes the dove
And it comes to take away the ones you love

Wake up you faithless
See your heartbreak gone

The wolf has found a way
To lead this foolish flock of sheep astray
And the clouds make fearful noises and slowly turn black and shake
The darkness comes around you and dark has come to take

And it will cut the life right from you
Leave you standing in the rain
With nowhere left to run to
And no one left to love you but the pain

Wake up you faithless
See your heartbreak gone
There's no use trying to hold on

Wake up you faithless
You won't be here for long
And this ship wreck will soon be gone

All that I know is what I've learned from troubled times
I've stood alone on the last shore where putting hand under black skies
I have been hunted through the valleys and the corners of my life
Fight or die

Wake up you faithless
And see your heartbreak gone
It?s no use trying to hold on

Wake up you faithless
You won't be here for long
And this ship wreck will soon be gone

The Classic Crime,"When the time comes I put my feet in the water
It's not as warm as I expect
Will I go down like a preachers son?
Or will I come back up like a world war vet?

Will I watch my brothers die?
Speak true words into their lives?
Will I hold them close and tell them why
The life they led was sacrifice?

I don't know much
But I know about love
And how it hurts me to give up
It hurts me to give up

When the time comes I put my hands on the table
They are examined for what they are
A long life line that's been cut short
By the road, the time, the battle scars

What I would give to be back home
Where the sunsets over the water
Someone save me from these preachers sons
Save me from their daughters

Still I don't know much but
But I know about love
And how it hurts me to give up
It hurts me to give up

Why do we always say we're fine
When it's obvious we lie
Why don't we ever tell the truth
What do we got to lose?

And I don't know much
But I know about love
And how it hurts me to give up
It hurts me to give up

And I don't know much
But I know about love
And how it hurts me to give up
It hurts me to give up

I can't stop cause my cash is flowing
I'm baggin' em' up bustin' em' down quickly
Cause I got five brothers waitin' on me at Thrifty's
I'm in the other bucket on the late night pursuit
With two kis and and forty ounce of brew
I ain't trippin' cause my tags are legit
Ah shit, now them tats is on my tip
So I drops my brew, what the fuck am I to do (Pass the street to shake that fool)
So I smashed on my pedal and rolled down Golden Gate
And threw these motherfuckin' kis in the lake

Guess who comes through, it's a fool
I gat tapped that ass, red dog, and boo
We kicks it on the Hill everyday
Slangin' rocks with glocks now we gots to get paid
The street life's how I'm livin' and the po-po tryin' to get me
But they can't catch up to a motherfuckin' philly
That's how I'm livin' in the day
But when it comes night I packs a forty and an AK
Waitin' for some punk to jump so I can start to pop
And put some motherfuckin' holes in his drop
The watch his ass grasp, then I laugh
He shouldn't have last so I taxed his punk ass

Because I'm rollin' through ya town with gold tone D's
Lookin' clean with my mug on mean
But in the ghetto it ain't nothin' but dope fiends
I pull up on the turf not thinkin' of gettin' burnt
With a nine in the trunk it ain't gon' be no funk

Because I post bail and all hell breaks loose
Cause I got juice, though it seems to me
In reality the other man is out to get me

And I ain't never heard of no extra money
The ninety-eight cents, no food for less
I send a dope fiend to steal my Guess
The ghettos of a way where the players star
Where white men won't, where white kids won't
They say it ain't cool and it's bad for they health
And if ya hit magazine then break ya self
Cause that's the rules man and don't ask why
Either you slang, gangbang, or die
My only concern is to strive

Is because I got people praying for me, bet
I pays my ties even though the money's filthy
Don't wanna go to church because I feel guilty
The way of the street life is really quite scary
Thinkin' tomorrow man I might get married
So when I leave my pad I grab mt glock
And my bulletproof vest and my ski mask dock
On the gooch pal, I won't be caught out of bounds
Can't let these fools stop my life
So I strive, I might be about one eight
But in the mind I more like twenty eight
I see the po-po poppin' the brothers droppin'
Niggaz plottin' and children starvin'
All this shit in my face
I gotta get up out of this place
The middle of V ain't enough see
A nigga feel like I gotta sell D

Three to a bed fightin' over covers

In the drought season I went rock for rock
I guess that's why they say I knock harder than a d-spot
And hoes ooh I'm on them sluts and tramps
You can ride on my trunk just don't blow up my amps

No peace, half of them fools I went to school with are deceased
Sad, especially when your rag don't come from much
I'm doin' bad, but they call me playboy
Partner came through in the clutch, reached out and touched
And I want the Chips Ahoy without the milk and honey
I ain't no punkish fool, steady missin' money
Steady missin' fetti, Eddie steady missin' scrill
I'm tryin' to make enough allowance to pay my water bill
[D-Shot]
Growin' up wasn't that cool to me
I didn't have that many friends just enemies
Until I quit school and started slangin' dope
Came up and wanted a lil' mo'
Mo' mail, clientele yo that sells
Humongous clout, tryin' hard not to fail
Boss ballin' feelin' my way this mo' each day
Out smartin fools tryin' to have it my way
[Suga-T]
Well, how can a cutie come so so tight
Everybody and they mama got a gat so don't nobody be wantin' to fight
Haters be out there bad tryin' to impress their foes
Pimps turn em' out and then they grow up to be sad-a-pus
Gotta keep a child because I'm tryin to get paid
Yeah, gotta shake these city slickers outta my way
But now mother's day I didn't like a hold on, amen
Stay strong, through it all, do it all
Cause folks is straight scandalous
[Chorus]
Scandalous, shit is gettin' scandalous
Scandalous, it's really gettin' scandalous
Scandalous, scandalous, scandalous yeah
Scandalous, it's really gettin' scandalous yeah
[B-Legit]
I'm off in this game, runnin' thangs tryin to get it
I do what I do but I'm true when I spit it
Talk about the time when the grind did me bad
Broke in my pad, took everything I had
Left me with the fo' maybe I can trade her in
Rent's due and all I got is a fen
Knots in my stomach can't understand this
Fools in the town becomin' scandalous
[E-40]
I know some things that'll stun ya, make ya wonder
I seen the scandalous use to cheer the social security number
I seen fiends make pipes outta ink pens
Commit incest throw they body at they own kids
Playas become haters, if they ain't doin' it now they doin' it later
Oh you ain't heard man this here's startin' to be contagious
Can't be sittin' in the cabinet collectin' dust
Plus, man this life is so scandalous
[Chorus]
Scandalous, scandalous, scandalous
Scandalous, really gettin' scandalous
Scandalous, scandalous, scandalous
[D-Shot]
I remember sittin' in the pen
On the pool table hopin' that I win
Ten packs of some noodles, coffee, and some cigarettes
Tryin' to get penitentiary on the ridge
It seems fools don't want to pay
My source of income depends on day to day
Nobody on the streets cares for me
No packages or no messages
[B-Legit]
Scandocious, keep my focus would ya feel me
Got me thinkin' people close to me tryin to kill me
That's why I ride with this hill side beamer
Bust ueys and only smoke with the lueys
The other day they was plottin' on my homie Dre
Tried to slip him a mickey in his Bombay
But now we knowin' not to fall for the oakey-doakey
It's all bye-bye when it smokes
[Suga-T]
I was left in the dark scene had to run
Did what I had to do, kept my game tight and never wonderin'
Credit card scandals, boostin' falsified checks
Takin chances, scandalous
[Suga-T singing]
You know times are so scandalous
What should we do, just keep on movin'
Close your eyes, have that flow
Could it be your face I see
Up in these scandalous dreams

Ya do what we do and do what we do to get paid
We get paid, some quintessential, real ass niggas
Stack chips and make some money up
Ya know, I said are-realize the game
Stack chips and make some money up

Countable, astronomical but monumental
I used sell and serve pops up out my auntie's Pinto
Still keepin' it ghetto, barbecuin' in the front yard
Slappin' bones, ton of niggas perkin'
Recitin' lyrics from my songs
Ain't nobody hurtin' we all workin'
Tryin' to have loot, in the studio
With hangovers tryin' to re-coop
I get down, ballin' like Kobe Bryant
You niggas is lousy, small things to a giant
How you gonna be swappin' up my style
And goin' off by a crack in my units
I'ma stick to the shit that made The Click
The super kind, I love to spit
That nigga 40 vicious, he got speech I heard him
Took his music out of the streets
Policy out on a small fee
Now to be clear, without equal
Both young and new MCs out for dinner
Crackin' ho ass niggas off something gravy
Especially when I get to doin' it by the way, hey
So that nigga told me, that's square
But why ya want to get in on that sucker sauce be	
I didn't ask you to get on this album
Cause he knew I'd fuck him off

I'm callin' shots to the streets my nigga
So niggas, they run and hide under bosses
No longer in California cause it's too many crosses
You fucked around and got a tip from a mad bitch
Cause you was next on the motherfuckin' hit list
You got ya ghetto pass revoked cause you ain't real
If you didn't get to steppin' you was gettin' killed
Rapper, slash street hustler
They both the same, a buster is a buster
Ain't got no chance to revive yourself

Alright",Catch Your Wave
The Click Five,"You and I
We never had it easy baby
We had to work so hard
And every time it feels like we're gonna make it
That's when it falls apart, but

Ooh ho
Baby I'll take my chances with you
Ooh ho
Baby I'll take my chances with you

Every night I think about the mistakes I've made
I try to change my ways
(nothin's gonna change my ways)
And I don't mind all the little games we play
And all the foolish things you say,cause

Ooh ho
Baby I'll take my chances with you
That's what I'm gonna do
Ooh ho
Baby I'll take my chances with you

Love is what you make it
So give it one more try
Cause I get turned down when you're not around
I just can't take it all

You and I
We never had it easy baby
We've both been hurt before
(both been hurt before)
And only time will tell us if we're gonna make it
There's no way to be sure, but

Ooh ho
Baby I'll take my chances with you
That's what I'm gonna do
Ooh ho
Baby I'll take my chances with you
You know it's true

Ooh ho
Baby I'll take my chances with you
That's what I'm gonna do
Ooh ho
Baby I'll take my chances
I'll take my chances
With you",I'll Take My Chances
