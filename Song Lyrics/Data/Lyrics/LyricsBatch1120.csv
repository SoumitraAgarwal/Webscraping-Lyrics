RiverMaya,"If I could choose to live my life
There'll be no ifs to say
If I would choose to hold your hand
There'll be no words to say

Without thought, without pride
Leave the things that seem to weaken us
Without fear, leave your lies
Let the magic turn your life around

If I would choose to touch you there
Will you touch me there too?
And if you choose to stay with me
I'll spend my life with you

Without thought, without pride
Leave the things that seem to weaken us
Without fear, leave your lies
Let the magic turn your life around

If I could choose to live my life
There'll be no ifs to say
If I would choose to hold your hand
There'll be no words to say

Without thought, without pride
Leave the things that seem to weaken us
Without fear, leave your lies
Let the magic turn your life around",If
RiverMaya,"Nobody knows
Just why we're here
Could it be fate
Or random circumstance
At the right place
At the right time
Two roads intertwine

And if the universe conspired
To meld our lives
To make us
Fuel and fire
Then know
Where ever you will be
So too shall I be

Close your eyes
Dry your tears
'Cause when nothing seems clear
You'll be safe here

From the sheer weight
Of your doubts and fears
Weary heart
You'll be safe here

Remember how we laughed
Until we cried
At the most stupid things
Like we were so high
But love was all that we were on
We belong

And though the world would
Never understand
This unlikely union
And why it still stands
Someday we will be set free
Pray and believe

When the light disappears
And when this world's insincere
You'll be safe here
When nobody hears you scream
I'll scream with you
You'll be safe here

Save your eyes
From your tears
When everything's unclear
You'll be safe here

From the sheer weight
Of your doubts and fears
Wounded heart

When the light disappears
And when this world's insincere
You'll be safe here

When nobody hears you scream
I'll scream with you
You'll be safe here

In my arms
Through the long cold night
Sleep tight
You'll be safe here

When no one understands
I'll believe
You'll be safe
You'll be safe
You'll be safe here
Put your heart in my hands
You'll be safe here",You'll Be Safe Here
RiverMaya,"Wag kang mabahala sa kahol ng mga aso
Ligtas ang pag-asang nakasakay sa ating mga palad at balikat
?Wag mong patulan, ?wag mong sakyan ang mga talangka
Panis ang angas sa respeto?t pagpapakumbaba
Walang matayog na pangarap
Sa bayang may sipag at t?yaga

Isang ugat, isang dugo
Isang pangalan, Pilipino
Isang tadhanang lalakbayin
Isang panata, isang bandila

Pekeng bayani
Pekeng paninindigan
Subukan naman nating pagtulung-tulungan
Paglayang ating minimithi
Hindi alamat, hindi konsepto
Ang bayanihang minana mo

Isang pangalan, Pilipino
Isang landas na tatahakin
Isang panata, isang bandila

Riverrock,"I've just seen a face,
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met.
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see
We've met, mm-mm-mm-m'mm-mm

Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware.
But as it is I'll dream of her
Tonight, di-di-di-di'n'di.

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.

I have never known
The like of this, I've been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, di-di-di-di'n'di.

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.

Yeah!
Bup-a-lup-bup!

Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again.

Rivers Cuomo,"It's like a holocaust to the boss when I toss
Too much knowledge kicked then you're lost
In a shuffle of feet, Jinx the fiddler
And I control your mind like Hitler

You bow and vow to authority
See now, a sucker with a style just boring me
So I show K N O W L E D G E, it might trouble you
Then I transform like a decepticon
With a mic as a bomb

I'm solo, you ask how I'm living
Still dropping more shit than a pigeon
With the L, the E, the N, the C, the H
The M, the O, the B, the great

Lyrics that make the beat swing and I gotcha
It's the hip hopper that don't like coppers
And if you try to upset the pot sun
You get kicked in the chest like a shotgun

I make the beats, I make the breaks
I make the rhymes that make you shake
Make you find, Ice Cube never caught in the middle
I make shit to kick you in the ass a little

And still never hesitate to stutter step
Or bust a repetition on the mic
Still dissing all the hype from left to right
How many left to fight?
So what that Lench Mob like?",The Bomb

Rivers Cuomo,"Come and walk with me
Through the world we love so much
And we'll kill all the beautiful things
We're not allowed to touch
We could fall in love
Then hate 'cause love never lasts
And we'll dance on the graves of our enemies
Won't that be a blast?

But oh, I'm ending my life with you
'Cause you're sharp as a knife
We're lost in the forest like Hansel and Gretel

Rivers Cuomo,"Well it's been building up inside of me
For, oh, I don't know how long
I don't know why
But I keep thinking
Something's bound to go wrong

But she looks in my eyes
And makes me realize
And she says don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Everything will turn out alright

[Chorus]
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby

I guess I should've kept my mouth shut
When I started to brag about my car
But I can't back down now
Because I pushed the other guys too far

She makes me come alive
And makes me wanna drive
When she says don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Everything will turn out alright

[Chorus]

She told me baby, when you race today
Just take along my love with you
And if you knew how much I love you
Baby nothing could go wrong with you

Oh what she does to me
When she makes love to me
And she says don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Everything will turn out alright

Oh, I can't stop partying, partying
I can't stop, partying, partying
I got to have the cars
I got to have the jewels
And if you was me, honey, you would do it too

Monday to Sunday I get all the clubs
And everybody knows me when I pull up
I got the really big posse with the ARP
And if you're looking for me I'm in VIP

Just follow the smoke, they're bringing bottles of the Goose
And all of the girls in the corner are getting loose
Screw rehab I love my addiction
No sleep, no sleep I am always on a mission

Rivers Cuomo,"Suddenly our shortcomings don't seem to matter at much

Waiting for me
You'll always be my girlfriend
I too am waiting for you
I'll always be your friend

I commend your stubbornness
Without it we'd never got this far

Chasing her leaves me with nothing but pain

Unlike you
She isn't true
She's got her own concerns
You never gave up

Getting harder to pretend is ok with me

In this moment I believe
And I want it so much

'Cause it's been hard enough just watching you tonight
I don't wanna hear your reasons, baby
We all want the same thing, we all want the same thing

Rixton,"I can barely sleep
There's something on my mind
I'm lying in the dark
I'm searching hard to find
For the love that we shared
And the life I left behind
There's only beautiful excuses in my eyes

I can scream and shout
But what's the point? it's done
Don't cry before you learn
Fly too close to the sun
You're starting to lose faith
So hold on to your pride
There's only beautiful excuses in my eyes

What makes an angel fall in love?
What makes a good man turn and run?
How do you know if she's the one?

I've made all the perfect turn of lies
And I've sugar coated my disguise
But I can't cover this up
With sweet goodbyes, no
There's only beautiful excuses in my eyes

She's wrapped up in her thoughts
We haven't spoke in days
She's saying that I've changed
Well she's stuck in her ways
I won't pick up the phone
I've said all there is to say
Gotta be strong
Because it's wrong for me to stay

What makes an angel fall in love?
What makes a good man turn and run?
How do you know if she's the one?

I've made all the perfect turn of lies
And I've sugar coated my disguise
But I can't cover this up
With sweet goodbyes, no
There's only beautiful excuses in my eyes

Too many beautiful excuses
Tell me what the use is
Trying to find a way to come back home
How can we correct this if we're disconnected?
I don't know, I don't know.

if you don't belong and the world feels too strong
And you're scared of the darkness to come

All the chances you take on this battleground

Gravity's pulling you down I know it's not easy

Still kicking and bringing us wicked raps when,
Other rappers lack sense, innovation absent,
Take that in to the count like your bank said,
Yeah, let me set the rhythm,
And these texts are spinning,
We be best in Britain,
When I say best, I mean best?,
As the best decision,
To see lesser limits

We aim higher,
Higher than Mariah in a choir or the? or bubbles in a wire,
Desire, to leave behind, the reason why,

Put it in perspective and then tell me that you don't agree,

Rizzle Kicks,"Diiiiieeeeee Miss Illusion,
Mmm yeah I love it when my lips are on her,
There‚Äôs a spark in our relationship I plant a kiss upon her,
I **** around too much and there‚Äôs a risk that I'm a goner,
So I've got her on hand like a badge of honor,
The downside is she‚Äôs never there when I'm lacking dollar,
So I've got to try and go through a day without acting bothered,
In the hope she‚Äôd leave me alone because I'm better off her,
But I see that spark and I just accept the offer,

So many people say why are you with her,
And I'm like; she‚Äôs a damn good kisser,
She feeds my addiction,
She leaks something different,
The smoke from our last meeting has risen,
Keep her away from all of the other boys,
'Cause you know she‚Äôs every single cutters choice,
Always there when the cold nights are lurking,
Gotta keep hold of my Golden virgin,

I think she‚Äôs good for me,
That's why I don‚Äôt want her to leave,
She helps me get down even when I shouldn‚Äôt be,
She‚Äôs there when I'm in need,
But she isn‚Äôt cheap,
The last time I saw her,
Mostly I couldn‚Äôt breathe,
And they say she‚Äôs bad for me,
But they say she‚Äôs bad for me,
But I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs bad for me,
But it‚Äôs a bit of a miss illusion,

She‚Äôs got a mate called Benson,
But he‚Äôs a bitter of a waster,
Always chats about silver and gold,
But I don‚Äôt think that he‚Äôs safe (right?)
Plus his mate like‚Äôs to come out at break time,
Try‚Äôs to act bad but I've smoked him like 8 times!,
And if I take it the wrong places then I face a fine,
And if I don‚Äôt take it much she say‚Äôs its a waste of time,
In fact she doesn‚Äôt lie,
She tells me that she‚Äôs bad for me,
Even when I patch things up I don‚Äôt feel like I have to leave,

I said I had to leave; I had to get away,
It‚Äôs funny when I'm not around I've seen better days,
Sometimes I demonstrate how to set it straight,
I filter out the bullshit and keep her locked in case,
But when I'm chilling she‚Äôs always in my mind,
I do her out but the doubts are just glassed in side,
I should respond in time but then I found out,
The last boy she kissed coughed and died,

I think she‚Äôs good for me,
That's why I don‚Äôt want her to leave,
She helps me get down even when I shouldn‚Äôt be,
She‚Äôs there when I'm in need,
But she isn‚Äôt cheap,
The last time I saw her,
Mostly I couldn‚Äôt breathe,
And they say she‚Äôs bad for me,
But they say she‚Äôs bad for me,
But I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs bad for me,
But it‚Äôs a bit of a miss illusion,

M-I-S-S-C-I-G-A-R-E-T-T-E leave me be,
M-I-S-S-C-I-G-A-R-E-T-T-E leave me be,
Can you please leave my vicinity,
Can you please leave my vicinity,
Actually wait nah I'll have another kiss,
Oh **** I'm in love with this chick what this its,
Straight robbery,
She‚Äôs always there when I'm by myself and I can‚Äôt remain solitary,
Babe honestly,
It appears that your bad for my health and a quick way to poverty,
You went from my pal to my lover,
Now I see you outside with thousands of other,
But you‚Äôre on my mind right now,
So I guess I'm coming down from another little fling,
Gotta confess this,

I think she‚Äôs good for me,
That's why I don‚Äôt want her to leave,
She helps me get down even when I shouldn‚Äôt be,
She‚Äôs there when I'm in need,
But she isn‚Äôt cheap,
The last time I saw her,
Mostly I couldn‚Äôt breathe,
And they say she‚Äôs bad for me,
But they say she‚Äôs bad for me,

Dennis is, not even half what this menace is.

I'm the one forcing you to break bad
Whilst little goodie two shoes glue plane models.
Mmmm an air of sophistication
When I enter various situations
Your best mate's gone downstairs while your stuck there with his sister waiting.
I'm chilling in estates,
Sniffing at a rave
Sitting in a cave
With a grin up on my face
I ain't civil but I'm brave
Never listening to faith
Quick smile
Then a middle finger to your face

Stuck in your pocket in your feathers while you sleep
I am a prophet and a profit's what you'll keep
You and I belong together
I'll live within your soul forever

Ahahah, what, listen up yo, ah
I'm in the spare bedroom at parties
Full of sweet whispers not very smarties.
Hope that nobody comes in
Knock another drink, one thinks with no mention of car keys
I'm a hoodlum stood in the woodlands
Gonna set fire to the trees
Who wouldn't?
Du dum dum dum
End of the episode
Punk style death threat letter in the envelope.
Somebody's door for a quick whizz
Real weekender bloke somebody kiss this
I'm your mistress' mistress
That your wife didn't put on her christmas wish list.
Let me rifle a quick flow
More punchlines than a high school disco
Ain't nobody gonna tell me what I wanna do
I'm rude
Get your thongs out I'm called Sisqo

Stuck in your pocket in your feathers while you sleep
I am a prophet and a profit's what you'll keep
You and I belong together
I'll live within your soul forever

The one who wakes up and can feel no pain
'Cause you strive on another mans strain
Me and you will never be the same
'Cause clearly for you this ain't just a phase
The type to steal something although that it is free
The type to make a promise just to break it clean
Who are you trying to be
Who are you trying to please
Make your mind up and choose your way
Maybe then we can seal the daaaay

Stuck in your pocket in your feathers while you sleep
I am a prophet and a profit's what you'll keep
You and I belong together

Yes I convinced myself I didn't like relationship malarkey,
And she says ""wait, you didn't ask me... (How I felt)""
I said I love that your a (nice girl), and I'm sorry
But this really wasn't time well,

Yes, yeah the other day I was sitting on the train but in another place,
I was on my way home, or maybe some would say,

Whatever's in my speakers (then),
I'd rather not be held accountable I bank on peoples feelings

Helped me reconnect my feelings then!

We like to think we live with nothing to lose and if we
Lose something let's come to move on, and I
No people find it hard to accept
One day we live our last breath, one gasp in your death
So I live life laughing instead, 
Every time we make a wrong path is a test
Going to bar, with your shield, always a sentence
I'm not a king amount men, I remember that I
Love beat, I love rhymes, I love sex,
Than she wanna love read and sub-text
Cause crap happens for a reason
And some other thinks that happen round nears them
One please them stops'em and beat them, screw it I'm leavin'
And so I write: see, I hate it when people walk in the uglyiest fashion,
Hater when people talk with no love or passion
Hater when small things, turn into something massive
I'll just get home, sick of another classic like

Baby, I never want you to go,
Cause you're the reason I live my life,
And Maybe, When I can walk on my own,
I'll only mean to keep you in mind,
Like Baby, I never want you to go,
'Cause you're the reason I live my life

You're my only sunshine,
You're the lights in my life,
When I'm down I just think of you
And next minute I'm fine

You're the hope in me
The only one in this world that can call with me
You are joving me, 
When I'm over sees
How we'll never fall out well hopefully,
I never want to go back to the days when
You went learn of how we actually make sense
And I was sad

Baby, I never want you to go,
'Cause you're the reason I live my life,
And Maybe, When I can walk on my own,
I'll only mean to keep you in mind,
Like Baby, I never want you to go,

Maybe one day, 
I have the strength to leave. 
I know you told all your friends. 
What a fool, he'll always be. 

But as soon as I try, 
Something takes a hold of me inside. 
Yes, it does. 
Oh baby!

I've been a fool!",One Day
Rjd2,"A Beautiful mind, turned water into wine
But that's not all
Broke the water, shined through
Shaped the earth, created the colder life
Radiated with energy, the great boat of life
The spark
Sparkling through the dark night
Then walked
And took forever without a thing in sight
Didn't hear a sound to the first ""treat""
""Deaf to the ocean swelled"" washed up a miracle
A Beautiful yours, a beautiful mine

By the grace of fire, out sprouts the land
And did desire, footprints in the sand
On top of the mountain peak where the man speaks to himself
Cursing to them with a start
What he felt can't be described
It's alive
Rise with the tide
Communicate with all sides, nothing wants to die
Buildin' this, build a bridge
Build a tower
Construct a dam, nigga, ho
Build a flower
Ultraviolet rays magnified the essence
All praise to the presence, one pure thought
Taught him the lessons
This spread with the first migration of the heads
The first wants to flock

A beautiful yours, a beautiful mine
One's so enlightened; one's so divine
The planet's hour line, all devoid of time
A beautiful mind

They opened up the brain and opened up the heart
What is man made of
Love from the dark
The will to invent the will
Work the field, the shield, the intent to kill, the uphill
Matter of existence, matter of persistence,
Matter of distance to search for the mystics
Finder of lost souls, teacher of apostles, the mind's so colossal
A beautiful mind

A beautiful mind, a beautiful idea
One that was right here, blind to the naked eye, tied to a fear
Once it was nothing and now it is here
A beautiful mind

Not accidental, coincidental, experimental
A beautiful man, though a touch so gentle
A life so simple to spin on the axis to access the temple
A beautiful mind

A beautiful mind, put fruit on the vine
At the same time he made love a crime
Mellowed out the strings of all mankind
Walked along side you when you was left behind
Purified the waters, carved the canyons
Fed the families when it was starved and famine
Drew the blueprints so everyone had a chance
Organized the people and made man advance
A beautiful yours, a beautiful mine

Something outa nothing
Oh, what a far cry
More than a hard tribe
Pointed out the start guide
Made love, made hate
Saved sake
Nothing left the crate but fate
Constructed structures, ? a labyrinth
Detailed a portrait
Healed nations
Took blame when no one else was happening
Evolved the species, and had patience
Wrote the scroll in thousands of languages
Came with us to fight against a giant ?
Created chaos, pervaded destruction
Made law and order and then corruption
Laid the foundation for all things to stand on
Then cleared the ground for the mother ship to land on

Sailed across the seas, followed the breeze
Cured disease
Made poison
Settled the fear, took them on the righteous path,
Gave them the math, and still had the time to laugh

What a beautiful mind to have",A Beautiful Mine

Rjd2,"Yeah.
Yo, what up?
This is Aceyalone.
What's happening?
Yo. 
Let me tell you a story real quick about one of my partners,
About this cat I know. 
One of my homeboys, and we just gonna call him Junior.
Yeah, Junior got some money just for being a good kid.
He sealed it up and never even opened up the lid.
Girls gave him candy cause he treated him nice.
He took it home and chopped it up, and doubled up the price.
Miss Thomas at the parent's conference said we honest.
She was astonished at his confidence and what he accomplished.
He respected his elders, but he knew who he liked.
He listened before he talked, and he never would fight.
It's like, everybody knew him or they wanted to know him,
And anytime they did something for him, they felt that they owed him.
He was learning a life game that no one would show him.
He had more than an idea of where he was going.
He grew into a young man and gained some trust,
And he had a knack for pleasing people, and that was a plus.
Any situation he was in, he would adjust.
He never cussed, and he never fussed what he discussed.

Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
We was the same age, but I still looked up to him because we had this thing together.
Some people just got that knack, and you can't do nothing about it.
But they end up being a victim of circumstance because he's on the rise and, you know, he's gotta battle against the odds,
And my man had such a good demeanor. 
He was smart, man. 
And he was a hustler.
And he had his ? up. 
And he had a natural ability to bring people together,
And which people he brought together.

By the time he turned 26, he was a...
He was becoming a young prince with a whole lot of sense.
Not only could he make money hustling white,
He had a little bit of everything to get you some height.
They made cash with him so nobody wanted to hit him,
But they'd get him if they had to get him, get rid of him quick.
But why kill off the goose if you're making grip,
And why kill off the captain if you run a good ship?
Some people are strong,
Some people are weak.
Other are smart, but still don't got a stomach for the streets.
But Junior had a different angle, he was an angel. 
The Calypso changed, though ?
The game could tango.
'Cause he can't tango.
A dance with wolves or waltz with a rattlesnake,
What would it prove?
They started salting ? up his program, hoping he'd lose.
But he stayed cool, and he stayed steady, making moves.

Yeah, okay. 
Meanwhile, Junior's off doing his thing, and living up to his full potential,
But the haters, and I don't even want to call them that cause they're worse than that,
But he's become a victim of the monster. 
You know, the machine, the revolving door.
It's them that got versus them that can't get, and ain't gonna never get.

Junior had it good.

Man, four years later, Junior got him a nice stack.
Compared to what he used to have, now he's got twice that.
When beef is at his door, he decided to ice that.
Now knowing more and more, he was caught in a mice trap.
He wanted to fight back.
But who could he tell?
The lesser of the two evils would just put him in a cell.
Everybody around knew that Junior was frail,
But he didn't need muscles to make it, all he needed was a scale.
A hundred and twenty-thousand in cold hard cash,
A stash at gun blast that don't even ask.
You get beat by the only one thing that can beat you,
Defeat you, cheat you, the streets will eat you.
Jealousy and envy make a person deceitful,
Then you add greed to it,
Combonation is lethal.

Well it's a short life knowing that it won't be a sequel.
Sometimes bad things just happen to good people.

Yeah. So they killed him. 
They murdered him in cold blood.
He died face-down in front of an empty safe.
And for the fools that did this, I hope you rot in hell.
I hope you live in hell.
For my nigga, Junior.
Rest in peace.

Junior had it good.",Junior
Rjd2,"A bunch of wild boys was hanging around
At the local neighborhood saloon
And some cat kept dropping quarters down in the jukebox
Playing all the favorite tunes

And back by the bar playing cards looking hard
Was big bad Solomon Jones
And watching over his luck
Was the love of his life
Is the lady that was known as Simone

When out of the night which was dark and cold
Into the smoke-filled dimly-lit room
Stumbled in a thug
Who was smelling like bud
And his eyes looked high as the moon

He looked like a man with his foot in the grave
And his lifetime about to be out
Yet he slapped down some hundred-dollar bills on the bar
And he yelled out ""drinks on the house""

Now nobody could place where this dude was from
But we knew that he was far from home
But we drank to his health
And the last to drink was big bad Solomon Jones

Now there are some G's
Who just run the streets
And they live life in and out of jail
And such was he, that kind of OG
That looked like he'd been through hell

With his hair in cornrows
A mean mug grill
Like a dog who's day is done
He lit up the green stuff in his cigar
And took hits one by one

Now I got to thinking who this cat could be
And what the hell is- going on
Well I turned around and who was staring at him
The lady that was known as Simone

And the white t-shirt all stained with dirt
He was trying not to be rude
But he was trying to find another
Good song on the jukebox
So he could just set the mood

Have you ever been out in the city streets
With the gang-made players so clear
Where the police and gangsters control the block
And gunshots is all that you hear

When the only sounds are the drums of war
And you left out in the cold
A half-dead man in a half-dead world
And a yellow-brick road to go

Then all of a sudden the music changed
And everyone just held their post √¢?¬®But it felt like a life had been robbed from you
And everything that you held close
√Ç?¬®That someone has stolen the women you love
And that her love was a devil's lie √¢?¬®That your heart was gone and the best thing that you could do is crawl away and die √¢?¬®It's the painful cry of a man's despair deep down in his bones √¢?¬®I guess misery enjoys company, said big bad Solomon Jones

And the stranger turned
And his eyes had burned
In a most peculiar way
And the white t-shirt that was stained in dirt
He sat in to watch me sway

Then his mouth had frowned up in this kind of grin
And he spoke in a voice so clear
""Boys you don't know who I am
And I know that you just don't care""

""Now I'ma say these words
'cause these words are true
And when I'm done here I'll be gone
But one of you boys is a shiesty dog
And his name is Solomon Jones""

Then I ducked my head
And the lights went out
And two guns blazed in the dark
Then I women swooned
And the lights came on
And the two men laced with the starch.

With a bullet in his head
And pumped full of lead
Was big bad Solomon Jones

What a thug from the street
Who was hoeing his heat
And who knows to that lady named Simone












",Solomon Jones
Rjd2,"Supahero
Baby I'm your star, but you looking for a super hero
And Superman don't fly no more cause he ain't one with the people
He ain't nowhere to be found, when he should be fighting evil

You make me whole It's not the movies, but it fake the role
I try to take control for the sake of soul
But the only thing I get to do is scrape the bowl
When God made me, said √¢??break the mold√¢??
I put foot to the concrete and shake the road
I don't have powers like a caped crusader
But I do have powers like an Ace invader
Back in the days he had so much flavor
He was so major to get you out of danger
Now you can't find him, and he's just a stranger
And if you did he'd probably give you the finger
Your hit channel's evil on your channel changer
And your hero with a lifesaver threw you an anchor

I really don't know what you thinking of
I can't make it wet from underneath my glove
I can't see through walls but I can see through you
You dress up the ball but that's all you do
You fell for him, he didn't fall for you
And just me is what I got to offer you
I don't save the day, I just pave the way
In the city of Gotham where every day's a day
I know it pays to play, but I ain't playing
I ain't laying my coat down; know what I'm saying?
You want lots of muscles and lots of green
But my hustle and bustle is my only thing
It ended all bad as my last song seems
You need a star in your life and not in your dreams

Las mujeres no son las unicas que tienen sentimientos
Mamita te voy a hablar claro
Yo me siento mal, muy mal
Ken-why, explicales

Ayer me dijistes que me amabas
Que no habria quien nos separara
Que yo era tuyo why tu eras mia
Para nuestro amor no habian medidas
Pero de repente todo cambio
Ya no eras la misma cuando haciamos el amor
Hoy me pides que me vaya sin ninguna razon
Tu no sabes cuanto da√±o la hare a mi coraz√≥n, perderte

Dime como olvidarte
Si no quiero alejarme
No me pidas que me vaya, no

No me pidas que me vaya, no
[Yo te quiero dar una vida, diferente]

Yo te quiero con todo mi corazon
Pero no entiendo la razon
Porque siento como tu why yo no somos lo mismo, a lo mejor
Estamos acostumbrao'
Why no estamos enamorao'
O maybe es algo que da duro
Why viene why se va como un morao
Pero mami let's work it out
Es un da√±o profundo
Pensar en los a√±os
Que tu why yo viviamos juntos
Why que, todos esos a√±os se fueron por gusto? (No, no..)
No me digas eso mami
Eso yo no lo puedo aceptar
Un amor como el nuestro es real
Un amor tan profundo
Yo te apuesto el mundo
Que tu te sientes igual
Un amor que no se puede olvidar
Un amor que no se puede ocultar
Un amor tan rico why tan fuerte
Que no se puede dudar

Como pudiste lastimarme
Si lo unico que hice fue amarte
Creo que merezco una, explicacion
Creeme, he tratado de olvidarte
Why lo unico que he logrado es recordarte
Dime, como aguantar tanto dolor

Dime como olvidarte
Si no quiero alejarme
No me pidas que me vaya, no

[Pero, pero mamita tu no entiendes?]
No me pidas que me vaya, no
[Tu eres la mujer que yo quiero,
Yo te kiero dar el mundo, yo te adoro
Hazme el favor why escuchame mamita]

Dime mami que es lo que tu sientes
Dime mami que es lo que tu quieres
Mira mi hija, tu sabes que la vida mia
Esta en la boca de toda la gente
Chisme por aqui, chisme por alla
Yo lo vi por aqui, yo lo vi por alla
Yo lo vi con esta, yo lo vi con esa
Entonces yo te llamo why tu no contestas
Yo te amo, yo te quiero
Yo te adoro, mi cielo
Yo quiero, vivir, mi vida, contigo
Yo te quiero complacer
Pero dime lo que tengo que hacer, dime
Yo te quiero complacer
Pero dime lo que tengo que hacer, dime!

Dime que debo hacer si la verdad es que no puedo
Alejarme de ti, olvidarme de ti, mamita yo no quiero
No me pidas m√°s que no, no te voy a complacer
Si todo estaba muy bien
Dime amor, en que falle!!?
En que falle?
En que falle?
En que falle?

Dime como olvidarte

Trato de borrar todos los recuerdos
Miro a todos lados y ahi te veo
Como hacer para poder sacarte de mi mente

Dimelo tu como hacer
Como borrar de mi el ayer
Dimelo tu como olvidar
Que fuiste mia y ya no lo seras

No es facil vivir en esta guerra
Del corazon ma' y de la conciencia
En la que ni se olvida y el otro pide pasiencia
No aguanto las ganas de amarte porfavor regresa

Por ahi comentan que ella raya la locura
Es que eres tu causante de mi amargura
Que ando loco sin grupirme la tadura
He pedido los sentidos, he perdido coldura

Dimelo tu como hacer
Como borrar de mi el ayer
Dimelo tu como olvidar
Que fuiste mia y ya no lo seras
(No lo seras)
(Dice)

Como olvidar esa forma de besar
Ma tu te fuiste y yo no puedo pensar
Voy pa la calle y no me siento normal
Porque te fuiste con aquel animal?

No se cuanto tiempo tengo que esperar
Pa estar contigo y ocupar el lugar
Que aquel no pudo yo no vengo ha jugar
Yo si te quiero el te va maltratar

Siempre que te veo yo enloquesco
Trato de no pensar en ti y no puedo
Como hacer para poder sacarte de mi mente
Trato de borrar todos los recuerdos
Miro ha todos lados y ahy te veo

RKM & Ken-Y,"I know that things are far from perfect
Please don't walk away
Give me a minute
Listen to what I have to say
I always put you number one in my life
Never thought we'd say goodbye

Mi amor te extra√±o
Cuando te siento lejos de mi
Vivir sin ti, me mata el dolor
Es que yo no soy nada sin ti
(No)

Siento en mi piel tus manos acarici√°ndome
Te busco y no te encuentro amor
Es que yo vivo extra√±√°ndote

Tengo un amor que solo se alimenta en tu voz
No quiere hablarle ya al corazon
y vive lamentando tu adi√≥s

Tengo un amor que vive en cada espacio de mi
Que se apodera ahahah de mi pasi√≥n
y me lleva volando hasta ti

Eres mi cielo, eres mi luz eres mi despertar
A ti te entrego todo sin mirar atr√°s
'Cause it's all about you and your future with me
Girl, it's so simple to see that this was destined to be

Abr√°zame, sentir que el tiempo es corto y se va
No existe la distancia en mi amor
Sera tuyo por la eternidad

Am√°ndote, bes√°ndote y tu bes√°ndome
Descubro que estoy sintiendo que quiero morir
y amarte otra vez; sabes que

Tengo un amor que solo se alimenta en tu voz
No quiere hablarle ya al corazon
y vive lamentando tu adi√≥s

Ouu tengo un amor que habita en cada espacio de mi
Que se apodera ah ah ah de mi pasi√≥n
y me lleva Volando hasta ti

Como le digo al corazon
Que ya no esta mas contigo
Sintiendo caricias tuyas si en verdad
No estas conmigo Cierro los ojos y te veo

Me refugio en tu recuerdo
y a la vez que pasa el tiempo
Me da miedo perderlo

Mi corazon se lamenta desde el d√≠a que tu te fuiste
Disimula estar sano cuando en verdad esta muy triste
Quiero saber si de verdad yo volver√° a amarte
Quiero saber si siempre vivir√° pa' recordarte

Tengo un amor que solo se alimenta en tu voz
No quiere hablarle ya al corazon
y vive lamentando tu adi√≥s

Tengo un amor que vive en cada espacio de mi
Que se apodera ahahah de mi pasi√≥n
y me lleva volando hasta ti

Poderte acariciar y poderte besar 
Decirte al oido que mi amor es sincero 
Y que por ti daria todo lo que tengo 
Y mi dinero 
A veces no te encuentro y me desespero 
Por que siento que si no estas a mi 
Lado me muero 

Ya no llores mas 
Por un amor que mal 
Te dejo llorando y sufriendo 
El amor se va otro llegara 
Gota que baja va subiendo 
Y no pasaras mas la vida 
Solita sola llorando 
Yo te hare feliz 
Quedate a mi lado

Con el tiempo crece y crece
Pero es da√±ino
Afecta mas, nos duele tanto
Cuando vienes solo sufro
Cuando no reventa en llanto
Es dif√≠cil pero es mejor no volverte a ver
Porque desde tu recuerdo que me hacen comprender
Que lo nuestro es imposible
Nos hace da√±o

Un salto nel vuoto scendo in ciabatte e torno
L'asfalto, il mio passato
E il mattino dopo sono punto da capo
Ho un nuovo gioco con cui mi coccolo
I compiti a casa non li portavo mai
Mi fiondo al posto con chi da prassi
Mi accompagn√≤ ai tempi, temi possa riperdermi
E mi ami pi√π di quanto mi aspettassi
Nel letto aspetto l'attimo giusto
Le chiavi con cui ti apro
Ti hanno tarpato le ali, rose nere nel bouquet
Intorno solo teste chinate, siamo io te e le altre
In fondo siamo pezzi di un puzzle
E passo io per lo stronzo
Gola secca senza senso
Nel frigo bar mi fiondo per primo uguale
E faccio avanti e indietro
Scrivo la mia bio in apnea
Respiro appena, respiro appena
Respiro appena-pena-pena
E scrivo la mia bio in apnea
Respiro appena
Respiro appena
Respiro appena
 
E gridi gridi gridi gridi quanto mi odi

In giro non ci sei pi√π
Mia madre piange se le sente
Quando stacca dall'ufficio nel suo mp3
Due lettere si incontrano per sempre
Se ci senti fammi un fischio, dai
Non scordarti la pillola
Ci mangiamo le viscere
A vicenda per l'affitto fai
Che non ero in me, s√¨ certo
Polvere di te al setaccio
I tasti che schiacciavo al cell
Ci sto per quanto serva
Salvo i miei prima che il treno parta
Alla fermata col mio zaino
In zona sanno tutti tutto
Un tattoo per non dimenticarlo
E dormi tra le mie braccia
Ti svegli tra le mie braccia
E mi odi per come gridi
E mi ami da come parli e ridi
Per come mi odi e piangi
Per come mi ami e piangi
Non sai se mi odi e piangi
Non sai se mi ami
Non sai se mi ami

You know I'll end up here again.

Falling and flying feel the same.
Hanging on to wherever this trip takes me,

[Lil' Zane]

Yeah, Next, uh Lil' Zane

Come on drop the top, let cha' hair fly

It's a clear sky tonight baby

Uh, let me know what's on ya mind

[Tweety]

It's Saturday, get the car shined up

Hair cut lined up, Heaven made my mind up

Professed one side of it tied up, won't see me there

I wonder how she wears her hair

If I see her I swear

I'm gonna put the game down like you

[Chorus: Next]

I'm just looking for love

I've been looking all over the club

Fresh Nikes, jeans cuffed, pressed in Sean John

Trying to find someone, someone for me

[R.L.]

I just tipped valet

Got in line through the metal detectors, stormin' days

Movin' to the sound of the DJ hoping she'll come my way

Is it the girl with the bomb weave, standin' next to me

Or is it the one with the short waves

A few are stepping but I ain't checking cause

[Chorus]

[Lil' Zane]

I switch lanes when I hoop game

Bet I score the same when I shoot game

I promise baby that I change whe the loop came

I'm off to bigger, better things with my new thang

No strings attached I'm on my two-way

Hopin' that our beams'll match

Gotta see you later baby, I'm a fiend for that

Wide body Navigator but my screens are flat

Now we watchin' motion pictures sittin' right in the track

Wanna honey dip, not interested in spendin' money

But how the money flip

She ain't concerned when I earn, she make money chips

I lit the fire place, baby gave me fine face

Tell me what cha' want but shorty I'm not Mase

I'm known for drillin' in a hole like I'm I-A

Fast as a speedin' bullet on the highway

Hopin' that I'm not late

And I ain't worried bout a ticket cause I got cake

Baby I'm lookin' for love

[Chorus repeated to fade; with Next & Lil' Zane ad-libs]

If she says ""we ain't fucking yet""

You either robbing the bank or you calling the cops
You either own a cruiser or own a yacht
You either live or you're living to die

I grind for everything I've got, bitch, I made it at work
And she grabbing for the bottle but I'm taking it first
'Cause I already got a headache and you making it worse
Yeah, young nigga stressed out and hair pressed out
She gotta have some chest, I don't try to test out
I made status quo, finna hand the rest out
That's enough for a mansion and a fucking guest house

High off weed and amphetamines
Still walking down yelling ""finally famous over everything"" (finally famous)

If I had this to do again and the evening were new again
I would spend it with you again, but now the curtain falls

Your cheers and laughter will linger after
They've torn down these dusty walls
People say I was made for this
Nothin' else would I trade for this and to think I get paid for this

Thank you, goodnight
But now the curtain falls

Rob Astor,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear
Rob Bailey,"I work harder than anybody knows and I've lost touch with everybody close to me,
But I won't stop, no, I won't stop, no, I won't stop, no, I can't stop!

Ok! So you've never heard of me, I am the reason that you've ever done anything creatively.
You sound ridicules! It's Rob fucking Bailey in this, bitch!
Stop crying about your blood and your sweat! Quit talking about things you haven't done yet!
Are you done yet? Do you need a second? Catch your breath I haven't even started yet!
I just want you to know that I am aware and I think everybody else is too!
Its been a few years, but I am well fed! Check my pedigree, I am well bred!
Ship captain, mine shaft, foreman till your hands black, like J. Henry, 
Hit spikes till I'm dead!
Lets take a break before the chorus and let that sink in.

I work harder than anybody knows and I've lost touch with everybody close to me,
But I won't stop, no, I won't stop, no, I won't stop, no, I can't stop!

Ywah, yeah And you should be a little jealous, 
At least that's all that instant messages tell us!
Well, I guess its on to the next one, mama said be the best so I am the best one!
We've invented this shit, with my whole life I've been in some shit.
Never got a handout, blue colors in me, blue on the outside,
Cut me open, blue blood comes out and I doubt I will bleed red.
Zombie mentality, work past death
And I'm hard in the head, brick walls couldn't stop a motherfucka, I am going all out!

No seeds, no water, no dirt, from concrete, I made it work.
Foundation, build over an empire, I am the bridge-stone, I am the fire,
I am the raw, I am the blueprint, I am the master you are the student.
So here is your first lesson, quit trying to be me!

War!""
""War 
War!""

This is a beginning, message I'm sending, out
To all the rappers who think they got clout
Maybe you do, maybe you don't
want to start a battle with me, but I won't
Cause it don't make sense to me, just to see
Who's the best you see
We got a lot of negativity, in the rap industry
Battling for superiority
Who's the best? Who's the worst?
Who's the good, who's the bad? I'm mad, listen up now!

[Chorus]
""War, war! Huh, good God y'all"" (C'mon now!)
""What is it good for?"" (What?)
""Absolutely nothing!""
Say it again now (pump it up, pump it up, see'mon)
""War! You M-C's listen"" (uh)
""What is it good for? Absolutely nothing!"" yeah yeah

This is secondary, tell me is it necessary
To battle another brother, hurry
Tell me the answer, I want to know this
This ain't war, this is show business
Unless, I guess
You think, you're the best, I won't 'fess
I'll make peace, even though I'm strong
Another flow right along in a battle

[Chorus] 

L-l-l-l-l-l-l-let's talk about Hitler, a man with a sick mind
One of the threats of all mankind
He thought he was the best, the baddest
He's dead, and I'm the gladdest
A lot of rappers, they get ego's
Like kings and queens, and all my heroes
But no, I'm not claimin' no titles
Young kids, rappers they idols
I'm not a gangster, I don't diss
A lot of rappers do and I'm pissed
Like Hitler, they want to rule
But God's the ruler you fool!

[Chorus: x2]

Now you're the best, the baddest, the roughest, the toughest
Man, you ain't sayin' nothin'
to me, cause I'm another MC
(Doin' what?) Battlin' for superiority
No! That ain't true, I ain't you
And I ain't tryin to just knock you
I want to get some peace and love and happiness
And things like those you can't miss
Stand your ground, I ain't saying be a punk
(Why not?) Cause if you do, your ship'll get sunk
Cause this is war, no, this is show business
So let's get down to the bottom of this

[Chorus] 

It's funny, I don't see Patti and Luther battlin'
(Why?) It's doesn't matter and
All I want to do, is make music
Throw it on so the people can use it
Rap is strong, word is bond, let's go on
Let the dream live on, we're movin'

En volgt het dievenspoor
Met schooiers en soldaten,
Hun petten op een oor.
Je tilt je rokken op
En lacht naar iedere man
Die in het donker wel durft
Wat overdag niet kan.
En bij nacht
In de kroegen hier,
Gaat je naam in het rond
Bij het blond schuimend bier.
Ik ken ze een voor een,
De heren van fatsoen,
Ik zal ze nooit vergeten
Zoals ze jou wel doen.
Hoe vaak heb jij zo'n kop,
Bezopen, stom en geil,
Niet aan je borst gedrukt,
Je lijf nat van zijn kwijl.
En bij nacht
In de kroegen hier,
Gaat je naam in het rond
Bij het blond schuimend bier.

En zondags in de kerk
Dan zit daar zo'n meneer,
Stijf als een houten plank
Met spijkers in zijn kop
Te kijken in zijn bank.
Een zwart lakens pak
Om zijn zondige lijf,
Bang voor de duivel
En bang voor zijn wijf.
En zuinig een cent
In het zakje doen.
Zo koopt hij zijn ziel weer terug
En zijn fatsoen.
En jij moet achteraan
In het donker ergens staan
Zoals het hoort.
Maar eens dan komt de dag,
Dan luiden ze de klok,
Dan draag jij witte bloemen
En linten aan je rok.
Wanneer we met elkaar
Gearmd de kerk uitgaan,
Wat zullen ze dan kijken,
Daar denk ik altijd aan.

Is just a prelude to the next

Rob Gardner,"You must have seen parties of Blockheads
With blotched and lagered skin
Blockheads with food particles in their teeth
What a horrible state they're in

They've got womanly breasts 
Under pale mauve vests
Shoes like dead pigs' noses
Cornflake packet jacket, 
Catalogue trousers
A mouth what never closes

You must have seen Blockheads 
In raucous teams
Dressed up after work
Who screw their poor old Eileens
Get sloshed and go berserk

Rotary accessory watches
Hire-purchase signet rings
A beauty to the bully boys
No lonely vestige clings

Why bother at all about Blockheads?
Why shouldn't they do as they please?
You know if it came to a brainy game
You could baffle a Blockhead with ease

How would you like one puffing 
And blowing in your ear hole?
Or pissing in your swimming pool?

Bigger brained Blockheads often acquire
Black and orange cars
Premature ejaculation drivers
Their soft-top's got roll bars

'Fill her up,' they say to Blockheads
'Go on, stick it where it hurts'
Their shapeless haircuts don't enhance
Their ghastly patterned shirts

Why bother at all about Blockheads?
Superior as you are
You're thoughtful and kind 
With a well-stocked mind
A Blockhead can't think very far

Imagine finding one in your laundry basket
Banging nails in your big black dog

Why bother at all about Blockheads?
Why should you care what they do?
'Cause after all is said and done
You're a Blockhead too

That he'll appear

Some day he'll come along

And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

For Machine Gun, took the poor boy away.
Stuck him in a hole in Leavenworth prison 
Where he lived until his dying day.

Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day

And mail it right away

And my heart is turning blue
And you still don't get it do you

To go it for the long run
So before the damage is done
Let's start back over at one

Lights out when every evening used to get so hot, now
We got so damned distracted we forgot how
To lock the world away and just get lost in

Rob McConnell,"A chair is still a chair
Even when there's no one sitting there
But a chair is not a house
And a house is not a home
When there's no one there to hold you tight,
And no one there you can kiss good night.

A room is still a room
Even when there's nothing there but gloom;
But a room is not a house,
And a house is not a home
When the two of us are far apart
And one of us has a broken heart.

Now and then I call your name
And suddenly your face appears
But it's just a crazy game
When it ends it ends in tears.

Darling, have a heart,
Don't let one mistake keep us apart.
I'm not meant to live alone. 
Turn this house into a home.
When I climb the stair and turn the key, 
Oh, please be there still in love with me.",A House Is Not a Home
Rob McConnell,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again

We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just Friends
Rob McConnell,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth make a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song
Rob McConnell,"I hear music when I look at you;
A beautiful theme of ev'ry
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true,
The song is you.",The Song Is You
Rob McConnell,"Must you dance every dance
With the same fortunate man?
You have danced with him since the music began
Won't you change partners and dance with me?
Must you dance quite so close
With your lips touching his face?
Can't you see I'm longing to be in his place?
Won't you change partners and dance with me?
Ask him to sit this one out and while you're alone
I'll tell the waiter to tell him he's wanted on the telephone
You've been locked in his arms
Ever since heaven knows when
Won't you change partners and then
You may never want to change partners again",Change Partners

Never to fade with the dawn,
And though you are gone

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

And tenement halls""

If revolution had a movie I'd be theme music
My music, you either fight, fuck, or dream to it
My life is one big rhyme, I try to scheme through it
Through my shell, never knew what the divine would bring to it
I'd be lying if I said I didn't want millions
More than money saved, I wanna save children
Dealing with alcoholism and afrocentricity
A complex man drawn off of simplicity
Reality is frisking me
This industry will make you lose intensity
The Common Sense in me remembers the basement
I'm Morpheus in this hip-hop Matrix, exposing fake shit

[Chorus]

Somedays I take the L to gel with the real world
Got on at 87th, stopped by this little girl
She recited raps, I forgot where they was from
In 'em, she was saying how she made brothers cum
I start thinking, how many souls hip-hop has affected
How many dead folks this art resurrected
How many nations this culture connected
Who am I to judge one's perspective?
Though some of that shit y'all pop true it, I ain't relating
If I don't like it, I don't like it, that don't mean that I'm hating
I just want to innovate and stimulate minds
Travel the world and penetrate the times
Escape through rhythms in search of peace and wisdom
Raps are smoke signals letting the streets know I'm with 'em
For now I appreciate this moment in time
Ball players and actors be knowing my rhymes, it's like

Rob Schneiderman,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April
Rob Schneiderman,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You
Rob Schneiderman,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Just one look at you

You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me!

Above all, I want my arms about you!

But I like your attitude
You are just the kind I've had in mind
Never could find

Honey, I'm so keen on you
I could come to lean on you
On a random bay, give you your way
Do what you say

Gee, it's all fine and dandy
Sugar candy, when I've got you

Then I only see the sunny side
Even trouble has it's funny side

Rob Smith Aka Rsd,"I know it's out of fashion
And a trifle uncool
But I can't help it
I'm a romantic fool
It's a habit of mine
To watch the sun go down
On Echo beach, I watch the sun go down

From nine till five I have to spend my time at work
The job is very boring, I'm an office clerk
The only thing that helps pass the time away
Is knowing I'll be back at Echo Beach some day

On a silent summer evening
The sky's alive with light
Building in the distance
Surrealistic sight
On Echo Beach
Waves make the only sound
On Echo Beach

Rob Smith Aka Rsd,"Everybody was kung-fu fighting
Those kicks were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening
But they fought with expert timing

They were funky China men from funky Chinatown
They were chopping them up and they were chopping them down
It's an ancient Chinese art and everybody knew their part
From a feint into a slip, and kicking from the hip

Everybody was kung-fu fighting
Those kicks were fast as lightning 
In fact it was a little bit frightening
But they fought with expert timing

There was funky Billy Chin and little Sammy Chung
He said here comes the big boss, lets get it on
We took a bow and made a stand, started swinging with the hand
The sudden motion made me skip now we're into a brand knew trip

Rob Stoneback,"Once I was alone
So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part

Rob Stoneback,"It had to be you, it had to be you.
I wandered around and finally found the somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me feel blue,
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you.

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss,
But they wouldn't do.
For nobody else gave me a thrill.
With all your faults, I love you still,

Rob Stoneback,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

The blue dress in the doorway

Help me remember the face I forget
And the traps that I've sprung

I guess I've grown tired
It's just what's expected of me
To tear your heart
From the inside to the outside
You know I was wired
I just couldn't help it
The hundred thousand times
I hurt you

I'm sorry for the screaming last night
And the nights before
I've wanted more from this
Than anything I've ever known

That I've never seen
In the years that I've known you
Dear Joan
I'll pick up the pieces
But some traveled so far
They flew when I kicked them
Across the room

I know you believed when I said it was over
You stood by me patiently waiting and brooding
So deeply in love
With every face I've shown

I'm sorry for the screaming last night
And the nights before
I've wanted more from this

Twice I'm a fool
Three times I wrap my hands around your neck 
While you're sleeping

Don't walk out the doorway
Because if you did
I believe I could honestly kill you

See you prime for giving in

Echoed softly on the sand

Lay your hand within my hand

Ever marching as to war
I would give my life to save you
I stand guarding at your door

We were brave like soldiers
Falling down under the pale moonlight

Just let me hold you so we both fall down

Fall on me
Tell me everything you want me to be

We were free like water
Flowing down
Under the warmth of the sun
Now it's cold, and we're scared
And we've both been shaken

Man, this doesn't need to be the end

Just let me hold you while you're falling apart
Just let me hold you so we both fall down

Stay I'm gonna need ya when

Now don't you take it for granted
Life is like a mean machine
It made a mess out of me
And let me come between
Like an anchor dream, I was stranded
I was stranded, yeah yeah yeah

And I'm steady though I'm starting to shake
And I don't know how much more I can take

[Chorus]
Well this is it now
Everybody get down
This is all I can take
This is how a heart breaks
You take a hit now
You feel it break down
Make you stay while I wait
This is how a heart breaks

Don't you want to go for a ride
Now to the other side
Feels so good you could cry
Now won't you do what I told you
I remember when you used to be shy
Once we were so fine, you and I
And why you gotta make it so hard on me
Yeah it's hard on me

And I'm sorry but it's not a mistake
And I'm running but you're getting away

[Chorus]

This is how a heart breaks

You're not the best thing that I knew
Never was, never cared too much for all this hanging around
It's just the same thing all the time
Never get what I want, never get too close to the end of the line
You're just the same thing that I knew
Right before the time when I was running from you

[Chorus: x2]

Oh yeah
This is how a heart breaks
Oh-oh-oh
This is how a heart breaks
I can't take it
How a heart breaks

What leaves you crying
And what makes you whole

How you'll still be there
When the heartache ends
It's alright
Why don't you tell me my friend

To find the surface when you're underground
There ain't no blanket that can hide this cold

To the corners and the outskirts
While the lovers and the lonely

I don't wanna hear about love no more
I don't wanna talk about how I feel
I don't really wanna be me no more

Dress down now I look a little too
Boy next door
Maybe I should try to find a downtown whore
That'll make me look hardcore
I need you to tell me what to stand for

I've been looking for something
Something I've never seen
We're all looking for something
Something to be

Hey man
Play another one of those heartbreak songs
Tell another story how things go wrong
And they never get back
My pain is a platinum stack
Take that shit back
You don't wanna be me when it all goes wrong
You don't wanna see me with the houselights on
I'm a little too headstrong
Stand tall
I don't wanna get walked on

I can't stand what I'm starting to be
I can't stand the people that I'm starting to need
There's so much now
That can go wrong
And I don't need somebody
Trying to help it along
It's the same old song
Everybody says you've been away too long
Everybody wanna take you what went wrong
Wanna make you like an icon
Till you believe that they're right",Something to Be [Downtown Version]
Rob Thomas,"Let it go
Let it roll right off your shoulder
Don't you know
The hardest part is over?
Let it in
Let your clarity define you
In the end
We will only just remember how it feels

Our lives are made
In these small hours
These little wonders
These twists and turns of fate
Time falls away
But these small hours
These small hours still remain

Let it slide
Let your troubles fall behind you
Let it shine
Until you feel it all around you
And I don't mind
If it's me you need to turn to
We'll get by
It's the heart that really matters in the end

Our lives are made
In these small hours
These little wonders
These twists and turns of fate
Time falls away
But these small hours
These small hours still remain

All of my regret
Will wash away some how
But I can not forget
The way I feel right now

In these small hours
These little wonders
These twists and turns of fate

These small hours, still remain

If we can keep ourselves a half a world away

But I will sing for you

No one said we had to keep the things we get

And we can't see where we are
Spending our whole lives
Walking the same lines
And it doesn't seem to stop

You stick in my throat
You melt in my hands
You cause me to wonder
As much as I can
I feel it all over
It's starting to lag
We're spinning our wheels so much
That it's hard to turn back

I think we're snowblind
We've had a hard time
And we can't see where we are

I will be the one to hold you when the tears run down your face

Rob Thomas,"You can go
You can start all over again
You can try to find a way to make another day go by
You can hide
Hold all your feelings inside
You can try to carry on when all you want to do is cry

And maybe someday
We'll figure all this out
Try to put an end to all our doubt
Try to find a way to make things better now, and
Maybe someday we'll live our lives out loud
We'll be better off somehow
Someday

Now wait
And try to find another mistake
If you throw it all away then maybe you can change your mind
You can run, oh
And when everything is over and done
You can shine a little light on everything around you
Man it's good to be someone

We'll figure all this out

I guess I'm past my prime
And now I'm overrated,
Overdressed, and overstated

Staring out the window of a combat zone

So just hold on

Hoping that the headlights shine on
Everyone around you has a heart of stone
But you just roll on
Just roll on

People are talking but you can't be sure
So many whispers at your own front door
And when you open up you lose that hope
Now you start to wonder if you're all alone

So just hold on
Driving through the valley of the great unknown
Hoping that the headlights shine on
Everyone around you has a heart of stone
But you just roll on

Remember walking when you thought you couldn't stand
Remember what it feels like
I know you think that they could never understand
Oh, but you don't want to be right
And now you only want to make it out alive

All the bridge and tunnel girls come out
We can dance until the walls fall down

We feel like hell, everyone knows

You can't go back, heaven help me
We've gone too far, when we can't be
The ones we want
This is who we are, who we are

A shot of whiskey and we end again

Rob Wasserman,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Rob Wasserman,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

And the band played on with no one around 
And the rice was gone oh hours ago 
And the white wheeled limousine's standing alone 

Well they met at the club where the brasses blow 
Where the wine did flow oh he moved so slow 
But finally one night as the wind stood still 
He got up the nerve and she said ""I will"" 

The day did come and the groomsmen arrived 
Came a little early to go over their lines 
As they walked to the church on the cobblestones 
Was heard in the bushes a moan and a groan

Rob Wasserman,"Gonna tell the tale of a dog named Zillionaire
who stands on the back of a whale howling out in the middle of the ocean.
Waves of dog emotion.
Howl on 'til you find your sailor.
Howl on 'til he carries you home.
Hear him calling for his master
a sailor lost at sea who sank inside a splash and disappeared beneath.
Zillionaire was left drowning in his sorrows riding on a whale, drifting in 
tomorrow.

Howl out for your sailor.
Howl for yourself.
Howl out for someone to carry you home.
Racecar driver skinny head lookin' out the window.
Racecar driver skinny legs pressed against the pedal.
Faster than a second thought speeding 'round the bend.
Never gonna be caught dead 'less they're at the end.
Racecar driver crazy fool, don't worry about nothin'.
Ball of fire burning heat, slammed against the wall.
Never calculated this thing happening at all.
Twelve excited people saw the ambulance arrive.
Everybody knew that he was more dead than alive.
Racecar driver crazy fool, he don't worry 'bout nothin'.
Racecar driver crazy fool, he don't worry 'bout nothin' cept crashin' o-o-o-ohh.
Crashing o-o-o-ohh. Crashing o-o-o-ohh like waves.
Way out where the water is blue there's no land to be seen.
The sky and the ocean fuse together like events inside a dream.
When the sun sinks in the water
stars look down and blink at the sailors standing on deck
who smoke cigarettes and think.
And sometimes when the waves are mellow,
all crashed out you can hear that lonely dog howling out.
Howl out for you master.
Howl all night long.
And maybe he'll hear you and carry you home.",Zillionaire

And you're out hangin' with your friends
So you say
Somehow I know it's not quite that way

It's getting pretty late
And you haven't checked on me all day
When I called you didn't answer
Now I'm feelin' like you're ignorin' me

I wish that you were home
Holdin' me tight in your arms
And I wish I could go back
To the day before we met
And skip my regret

I wish I wasn't in love with you
So you couldn't hurt me
It just ain't fair the way you treat me
No, you don't deserve me

Wasted my time thinkin' 'bout you
And you ain't never gon' change
I wish I wasn't in love with you
So I wouldn't feel this way

When you touch me my heart melts
(And anything you did wrong I forgive) Yeah, yeah
So you play me and take advantage
Of the love that I feel for you

Why you wanna hurt me so bad
I believed in you that's why I'm so mad
Now I'm drowning in disappointment
And it's hard for me to even look at you

I wish that you were home, oh, yes, I do
Holdin' me tight in your arms, ooh, baby
And I wish I could go back
To the day before we met
And skip my regret

I wish I wasn't in love with you
So you couldn't hurt me (I don't wanna hurt no more)
It just ain't fair (It just ain't fair, no) the way
you treat me
No, you don't desert me (You, you)

And you ain't never gon' change (You ain't never gonna
change)
I wish I wasn't (I wasn't in love) in love with you
So I wouldn't feel this way (I wouldn't feel this way)

Said you care about me, but from what I see
I ain't feelin' that, so I disagree
Gave you all my love and understanding
And you treated me like your enemy

So leave me alone, don't bother to follow me
Now just go back where you came from
This house is no longer your home
You are not welcome no, no, no more, no more

I wish I wasn't in love with you
So you couldn't hurt me (You couldn't hurt me, baby)
It just ain't fair (It just ain't fair) the way you
treat me (The way you treat me)
No, you don't deserve me (You don't deserve me, baby)

Wasted my time (Oh, oh) thinkin' 'bout you
(Thinkin' about you)
And you ain't never gon' change (You're never gonna
change, never gonna change)
I wish I wasn't in love with you
So I wouldn't feel this way

I wish I wasn't in love with you
So you couldn't hurt me (You couldn't hurt me this
bad)
It just ain't fair (It ain't fair) the way you treat me

And you ain't never gon' change (You ain't gonna never
change)
I wish I wasn't (Wasn't) in love with you (In love
with you)
So I wouldn't feel this way

Hear you knockin' at the door again
I'm wonderin' should I let you in
I open up the door and see
The flowers for me, so beautiful in your hand
You start beggin' me to take you back
I've always been a sucker for romance
And before you know it I could see it, you're all over
me

And everyday I try to stack my grip and make three songs
I'm try'na get my mothafuckin' paper on
I want the new (bone?) and the new cell phone
I want the new two way pager and the new mansion home

Of course it's gon' be some niggas who think I done changed
They find me guility just because now I got diamonds on every thing

I'm 'bout my business so give me my cash or give me my check
See I can biblically remember me and Trae on the block
Even more then hustlin' sometimes we had to lay on the block
Eat, sleep, shit, piss, pray on the block
To make it through the night to see another day on the block
Movin' rocks got us full pockets-plus knots in our socks
But now money be comin' in wadd's like blocks

Where to from here
You won't say a word

Or run and hide

To take the open road
We don't have to walk 
That road alone

It's the things we have at stake
Here behind the noise we make

Oh, friend
Don't turn your back
While I watched you slip away
I know love lies sleeping

Forgive the past
Let the good things last
And brother together we can move on

The real me is to laugh all night lying in the grass just talking about love
But lately I've been jaded life got so complicated

I'm still thinking about it almost forgot what it was like
Do you know what it feels like?
'Cause with you
I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothing but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby as I do now
Now that I'm with you
With you
Now that I'm with you

You speak and it's like a song
And just like that all my walls come down
It's like a private joke just meant for us to know
I relate to you naturally
Everybody else just fades away
Sometimes it's hard to breathe
Just knowing you found me
'Cause I'm still thinking about it almost forgot what it was like
Do you know what it feels like?
'Cause with you
I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothing but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby as I do now
Now that I'm with you
With you

Come and take me
Love you save me
Like nobody else
Now I can be myself
With you

With you
I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothing but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby as I do now (Baby as I do now)
Now that I'm with you",With You

And the boys at the RR say she's a flat firebrand
Yeah but they don't know how the dirty words fair her
When she's tearin' up the bed with a natural goodtime man

I remember the night I met her
I was starin' down a G and T
When a gal let fly with an F-word
I had to look around and see
The bartender said ""Hey, buddy
Don't even let it cross your mind""
But I took her home, and I'm glad I did
'Cause I found the heart that the mouth kept hid
She's a whole different women when the lights get low
Dirty-mouthed Flo

Well, it sure beats me how a woman
As filthy as a pig at a trough
Can turn to a perfect angel

On blindly through the rain
She likes to think she's turning wise

Robbie Fulks,"A world filled with wonder, a cold, fathomless sky
A man's life so meager, he can but wonder why
He cries out to Heaven its truth to reveal
The answer: only silence, for God isn't real.

Go ask the starving millions under Stalin's cruel reign
Go ask the child with cancer who eases her pain
Then go to your churches, if that's how you feel
But don't ask me to follow, for God isn't real.


He forms in his image a weak and foolish man
Speaks to him in symbols that few understand
For a life of devotion, the death blow he deals
We'd owe Him only hatred, but God isn't real.

Go tell the executioner of the power he can't defy
Go tell his shackled victim of the mercy on high...
Then go to your churches, go beg, pray, and kneel,
But don't ask me to follow, for God isn't real.

The pall of perfumed true confessions

You can cut it with a straw

Drinking in the mezzanine with millionaires' first wives

Full of rage in 1960
There the coiffured ex-viscount
Watches empty seconds fly
Until the blood clot zeroes in
And grants him immortality again

Two for the road every evening, til guess what happened pretty soon

I cheated and I lied, I swallowed my pride
And then, Washed it down with Cocktails

I had a house on a hillside, the car I was driving was new
I had money in my pocket, but look what liquor made me do

Robbie O'Connell,"Tim Finnegan lived in watling street
A gentle Irishman, mighty odd
He'd a beautiful brogue so rich and sweet
To rise in the world, he carried a hod

See, he'd sort of a tipplin' way
With love for the liquor poor Tim was born
To help him on with his work each day
He'd a drop of the craythur every morn'

Now, dance to your partner
Welt the floor, your trotters shake
Wasn't it the truth, they told ye lots of fun
At Finnegan's wake

One morning Tim got rather full
His head felt heavy which made him shake
Fell from a ladder and he broke his skull
They carried him home, his corpse to wake

Rolled him up in a nice clean sheet
And laid him out upon the bed
A gallon of whiskey at his feet
And a bottle of porter at his head

Whack fol, de, dah
Now, dance to your partner
Welt the floor, your trotters shake
Wasn't it the truth, they told ye lots of fun
At Finnegan's wake

His friends assembled at the wake
And misses Finnegan called for lunch
First she brought in tea and cake
Then pipes, tobacco and whiskey punch

Biddy O'Brien began to cry
Such a nice clean corpse, did you ever see?
Tim mavourneen, why did you die?
Arrah, hold your gob, said Patty Megee

Whack fol, de, dah
Now, dance to your partner
Welt the floor, your trotters shake
Wasn't it the truth, they told ye lots of fun
At Finnegan's wake

Then Maggie O'Connor took up the job
""Arrah"", biddy says, she ye're wrong, I'm sure
Biddy then gave her a belt on the gob
And left her sprawling on the floor

There the war did soon engage
Woman to woman and man to man
Shillelah law was all the rage
An a row and a ruction soon began

Now, dance to your partner
Welt the floor, your trotters shake
Wasn't it the truth, they told ye lots of fun

Then Mickey Maloney raised his head
When a bottle of whiskey flew at him
It missed him falling on the bed
The liquor scattered over Tim

Tim revives, see how he rises

Then Whirl your whiskey around
Like blazes Thanum an Dhul

Robbie O'Connell,"One pleasant evening in the month of June
As I was sitting with my glass and spoon
A small bird sat on an ivy bunch
And the song he sang was ""The Jug Of Punch""

What more diversion can a man desire
Than to sit him down by a snug turf fire?
Upon his knee a pretty wench
And on the table a jug of punch

Let the doctors come with all their art
They'll make no impression upon my heart
Even the cripple forgets his hunch
When he's snuggled 'side a jug of punch

And if I get drunk, well the money's me own
And them that don't like me, they can leave me alone
I'll tune me fiddle and I'll rosin me bow
And I'll be welcome wherever I go",Jug of Punch
Robbie O'Connell,"Of all the money that e'er I spent
I've spent it in good company
And all the harm that ever I did
Alas it was to none but me
And all I've done for want of wit
To memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
If I had money enough to spend
And leisure to sit awhile
There is a fair maid in the town
That sorely has my heart beguiled

Her rosy cheeks and ruby lips
I own she has my heart enthralled
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Oh, all the comrades that e'er I had
They're sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They'd wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and softly call
Good night and joy be with you all",Parting Glass
Robbie O'Connell,"There was a wild colonial boy, Jack Duggan was his name
He was born and raised in Ireland in a place called Castlemaine
He was his father's only son, his mother's pride and joy
And dearly did his parents love the wild colonial boy

At the early age of sixteen years, he left his native home
And to Australia's sunny shore he was inclined to roam
He robbed the rich, he helped the poor, he shot James McAvoy
A terror to Australia was the wild colonial boy

One morning on the prairie as Jack he rode along
A listening to the mockingbird a singing a cheerful song
Out stepped a band of troopers, Kelly, Davis and Fitzroy
They all set out to capture him, the wild colonial boy

""Surrender now Jack Duggan for you see we're three to one
Surrender in the Queen's high name for you're a plundering son""
Jack pulled two pistols from his belt and he proudly waved them high
""I'll fight, but not surrender,"" said the wild colonial boy

He fired a shot at Kelly, which brought him to the ground
And turning 'round to Davis, he received a fatal wound
A bullet pierced his proud young heart from the pistol of Fitzroy
And that was how they captured him, the wild colonial boy",Wild Colonial Boy

Smack in the heart of the bible belt
Where nothing ever changes
While nothing remains the same
When first I saw the raven
Lean against the wind
I said who's the girl
With the tattoo on her skin
I followed her home
She lives down by the water
My friend Teddy told me
She's the Frenchman's daughter

On this day of reckoning
I'm riding shotgun with you
Tangled twisted strands of love
Hanging from above

I'm burnin for you
Burnin for you
We were first time lovers
In a secret rendezvous
Burnin, burnin
Burnin for you

When I come knocking on her front door
The neighbour said she don't live there no more
Well she moved from the country
Down to the city
Where the scene was dark
And the street was gritty
In the hustle and bustle and all the commotion
She got addicted to the locomotion

On this day of reckoning
By the old wooden bridge
I wait for you
Tangled twisted strands of love
Hanging from above

I'm burnin for you
Burnin for you
We were first time lovers
In a secret rendezvous
Burnin, burnin
Burnin for you

I remember the smell of the burning leaves
And we were making love
She was like a young Georgia O'Keefe
From another time
In an old abandoned railroad shack
On should never go
Where anything can happen
When the zephyr blows

On this day of reckoning
I'm calling to you
Tangled twisted strands of love
Hanging from above

I'm burnin for you
Burnin for you
We were first time lovers
In a secret rendezvous
Burnin, burnin
Burnin for you

The phone rings she said
I can't tell you where I'm calling from
Cause my papa's on the lam
For something shady that he's done
There hangs a tale of love
For the first time
For the first time

Go back go back go back to your woods

Carry a torch and an old stiletto
The sound of thunder all over the ghetto
One-eyed jacks and king with the axe
Come from the wrong side of the tracks

When the night goes down on Storyville
If the women don't get ya the music will
Catch a thrill

You come down here in a four piece suit
Pork pie hat and the alligator boots
Keep jerking rabbits outta your hat
Now can ya pull a disappearing act

Go back go back to your woods
(Go back go back go back to your woods)
Go back go back go back to your woods

We came from a far off land

Robbie Robertson,"The sun was going down
Over Echo Park
Wet raven hair
Glowing in the dark
And that's when the fever would rise
And lord what a look in her eyes
From the moment that she blows out the light
We'd be lost in the forever night

Hold back the dawn
Hold back the dawn
Won't you raise up your hand
And hold back the dawn

I dreamt if I could lay you upon this bed of straw
And we may break the rules but we don't break the law
Come across but the river's too wide
I'd come across but the river's too high
And over by the fountain where we meet
I will lay silver roses at your feet

Hold back the dawn
Hold back the dawn
Won't you raise up your hand
And hold back the dawn

Now I have seen a painting
Old and hanging in a frame
And that painting was of you
Now how can you explain
From another place in time
Done many years ago
Why I'm haunted by this vision
Guess we'll never know
And then she turned and whispered in my ear
Can you feel my heartbeat

Hold back the dawn
Hold back the dawn
Won't you raise up your hand
And hold back the dawn
(Let the night go on, let the night go on, let the night go on)

Won't you raise
Won't you raise up
Won't you raise up your hand
And hold back the dawn

Hold back the dawn
Won't you raise up your hand
And hold back the dawn
(Let the night go on and on and on)

The waves of people in Chinatown

I put the word out on the waterfront

She still lives down this way
Remember when I was just a kid
And she would tell a story

Of the rainbow
Rainbow

I come to you with an empty heart
It's locked and I've lost the key
Now she was old and almost blind
But she sees more than you or me
With her cane pointed towards the sky
She said I'll know if you've heard
The silence between the words

Of the rainbow

No one knows
Where the rainbow goes

Walk down the long road
Your back against the wind
And should you lose yourself again

When the rains come again
And shine this light over you

That's the sign of the rainbow

Walk on down the hard road
That's buried in your soul
And you can feel the light within
Go upon a mountain
That's painted in the sky
I want you to ride with me
When the rains come again
And I will carry you home

Walkin to the rainbow

And you will dance the song of light

Where do you go in the naked night
All of the prophets that come before you
They can hear your lonesome cry

When you're out there in the night
All alone
When you're staring in the light
At the end of the road

In those proud shoes coming on up the alley
In those proud shoes walks all over the sky
Then he tipped his hat just like Don Quixote
And said don't let the rapture pass you by

Heard a bugle blowing in the misty morning
What a haunting sound over Times Square
Heard of the ghost of 52nd Street
Looked out the door but no one was there

Out in the cold Harlem rain
I went searching for this minstrel man
Played me a song to ease the pain
With a Salvation Army band

When you're out there in the dark
All alone
When you're sleeping in the park
At the end of the road

Then he tipped his hat just like Don Quixote
And said don't let the rapture pass you by

In the neon wilderness and the asphalt jungle
He carries his cross of passion
Through the wreckage and the rumble

Robbie Robertson,"The general rode for sixteen days
The horses were thirsty and tired
On the trail of a renegade chief
One he'd come to admire
The soldiers hid behind the hills
That surrounded the village
And he rode down to warn the chief
They'd come to conquer and pillage
Lay down your arms
Lay down your spear
The chief's eyes were sad
But showed no sign of fear

[Chorus:]
It is a good day to die
Oh my children dry your eyes
It is a good day to die

He spoke of the days before the white man came
With his guns and whisky
He told of a time a long time ago
Before what you call history
The general couldn't believe his words
Nor the look on his face
But he knew these people would rather die
Then have to live in this disgrace
What law have I broken
What wrong have I done
That makes you want to bury me
Upon this trail of blood

[Chorus:]

We cared for the land and the land cared for us
And that's the way it's always been
Never asked for more never asked too much
And now you tell me this is the end
I laid down my weapon
Laid down my bow
Now you want to drive me out
With no place left to go

And he turned to his people and said dry your eyes
We've been blessed and we are thankful
Raise your voices to the sky

Robbie Robertson,"You know we have a million stories to tell
I'm just one of a million or more stories that could be told

Sacrifice your freedom
Sacrifice your prayer
Take away your language
Cut off all your hair
Sacrifice the loved ones
Who always stood by me
Stranded in the wasteland
Set my spirit free

My name is Leonard Peltier
I am a Lakota and Anishnabe
And I am living in the United States penitentiary
Which is the swiftest growing
Indian reservations in the country

I have been in prison since 1976
For an incident that took place on the Oglala-Lakota Nation
There was a shoot-out between members of the American Indian Movement
And The F-B-I and the local Sheriffs State Troopers
Two agents were killed and one Indian was murdered

Three of us were charged with the deaths of the F-B-I agents
My co-defendants were found not-guilty by reasons of self-defense
My case was separated and I was found guilty before a jury of non-Indian people
The prosecutor stated that they did not know who killed their agents
Nor did he know what participation Leonard Peltier may have played in it
But someone has to pay for the crime

There's a lot of nights that I lay in my cell
And I can't understand why this hell this hell and this terror
That I have been going through for twenty-one years hasn't ended

Sacrifice your freedom
Sacrifice your prayer
Take away your language
Cut off all your hair
Sacrifice the loved ones
Who always stood by me
Stranded in the wasteland
Set my spirit free

But yet I know in my heart that someone has to pay sacrifice
To make things better for our people
The sacrifice I have made when I really sit down to think about it
Is nothing compared to what our people a couple hundred years ago
Or fifty years ago or twenty-five years ago have made
Some gave their lives
Some had to stand there and watch their children die in their arms
So the sacrifice I have made is nothing compared to those

I've gone too far now to start backing down
I don't give up
Not 'til my people are free will I give up
And if I have to sacrifice some more
Then I sacrifice some more",Sacrifice

She said that she'd meet me by the fork in the road

I'm heading for the pow-wow
I follow the red path that leads to you.

I gave my love a golden feather
I gave my love a heart of stone
And when you find a golden feather
It means you'll never lose your way back home.

Should I paint my face
Should I pierce my skin
Does this make me a pagan
Sweating out my sin
We ate the sacred mushroom
And waded in the water
Howling like coyotes
At the naked moon.

I gave my love a golden feather
I gave my love a heart of stone
And when you find a golden feather
It means you'll never lose your way back home.

In the autumn night
When there's no wind blowin'
I could hear the stars falling in the dark
When you find what's worth keeping
With a breath of kindness
Blow the rest away.

I gave my love a golden feather
I gave my love a heart of stone
And when you find a golden feather
It means you'll never lose your way back home.

Robbie Robertson,"They say the axman's coming
In a long black car
They said the axman's coming
He plays a mean guitar

Well he slipped across the border
With a hatchet in his hand
They said who's that stranger
The one they call the axman

You got Duane and Stevie Ray
All brothers of the blade
Jimi James and RJ
All brothers of the blade

Now when he goes from town to town
He picks 'em up and lays 'em down
People come from miles around
Just to dig that crazy sound

I heard a guitar wail
Until the break of dawn
You know the axman was here
Oh but now he's gone

You got T Bone and Link Wray

Then there's Django and Elmore James

Now when he goes from town to town

Bring a tear to your eye
Chills run down to your feet

Robbie Robertson,"I wonder where it all began
Was it in a place or in the heart
Was it outside in the pouring rain
In the darkness where the dreaming starts

If I end up begging like a dog
Does it make me any less than you
Why should I stand here and be judged
When we already know the truth

There was a time when I was lost
Couldn't see the woods for the trees
How could I know how much it costs
'Til I was on my knees

Just to find out what you got

She has a certain kind of thing
It's called the mystery of desire
Keeps pulling on my heart string
I'm like a man on a wire

What does it mean to want so much
The way that I'm wanting you
Am I just setting myself up
To play the fool

I got wasted on the moonshine
Too far gone

I was walking in the sundown
I was heading for the breakdown
When you're sleeping on the cold ground
Too far gone

There was a cloud hanging over me
Something just reached out and grabbed a hold of me

Outside they was beatin' on a door

I was running on a red light
Always looking for a street fight
I was higher than a lost kite

When you're hooked so bad you could not stop

And I want to take her over
Oh way across the sea
And I want to bring her over

Robbie Robertson,"From the Chitlin' Circuit to the Peppermint Lounge
Been run off more than once for goin' underground
Where I met an old bluesman with a walking cane
He wore a stripe suit and used someone else's name

He said son I've seen it all
And it's not what you think
He said there's some tough choices to be made
Then he took a little drink
And I heard him say

I do not play no rock and roll
Would not be moved to sell my soul
The demons are out tonight
Rock you sinners
The demons are out tonight
Roll you sinners
Straight down the line

I passed an old church on my way back East
Heard a gospel choir singing of war and peace
I was deeply moved so I stepped inside
I just stood in the back where I could easily hide

A woman in a black robe stood up
And pointed me out
She said Hallelu Hallelu
Oh then she began to shout
And I heard her say

I do not play no rock and roll
I would not be moved to sell my soul
The demons are out tonight
Rock you sinners
Oh the demons are out tonight
Roll you sinners
Straight down the line

Now he could croon a tune as good as anyone
And if he sings a song then that song's been sung
Some things have tradition, some shine like new
Some things you can't change no matter what you do

He said my friend I've done it all
Either for love or money
And if I laugh at your jokes
Oh that means his jokes are funny
And one more thing

We had dreams when the night was young
We were believers when the night was young
We could change the world stop the war

But that was back when the night was young

Sign reads God Bless America guns and ammo

Sign reads repent the end is near

Man I wish I was young
My guitar is out of tune even that's highly strung

And the words we didn't say last night
Shook the world to the core
We had nothing to say last night
We'd said it all before
And I say

Lonely times and lonely tears
Will fade away when you disappear
The time is right for me to stray
I'm gonna find a better day

Kickin' off cause it suits me
I'm gonna leave the country
And the time is right to find a better day

Makin' sense of my past now
I'll only love when I want to
Cause the time is right to find a better day

Maybe I didn't love you
Maybe you loved her less
Would you have preferred it
If I'd have worn the dress

In our lover's story
If you stay
You won't be sorry

Soon you'll grow, so take a chance

Hung up on romancing

We bought a lot of things
To keep you warm and dry
A funny old crib
On which the paint won't dry

I bought you
A pair of shoes
A trumpet you can blow
And a book of rules

Of what to say to people
When they pick on you
'cause if you stay with us
You're gonna be pretty kooky too

Won't you stay

Go to school
Remember how they messed up
This old fool

Don't pick fights
With the bullies or the cads
I'm not much cop at fighting
Other people's dads

And if the homework
Brings you down
Then we'll throw it on the fire
And take the car down town

I want to know you
Get the phone, call a cab, and take you home, yeah

Tell you lies like: ""I love you,"" and ""I adore you.""
I think there's something you should know

And you look so sweet
Can take you home where I live
Lay you by the fire
Love me, lady
I'm a liar

The curtain's closed
And the night is fun
I think it's time for me to not be home alone
I think I'll put the cat out and give the dog a bone
I hardly know you, but I like your figure
Suppose I'll read about you in The Mirror
I think there's something everybody should know

Why do you always doubt that there can be a better way
It doesn't make me want to stay

Why don't we break up
There's nothing left to say
I got my eye shut praying they won't stray
Oh! When I sexed up
That's what makes the difference today
I hope you blow away

You said we're fatally flawed
When I'm easily bored, Is that okay?
Write me off your list
Make this the last kiss
I'll walk away

Why don't we talk about it
I'm only here
Don't shout it
Given time we'll forget
Let's pretend we never met

Why don't we break up
There's nothing left to say

Oh! When I sexed up

Anyway, I chose you
And that's all gone to wasted

And my pain walks down a one way street
I look above
And I know I'll always be blessed with love
And as the feeling grows
She breathes flesh to my bones
And when love is dead
I'm loving angels instead

And through it all she offers me protection
A lot of love and affection

When you're defenceless
And they're killing me, but killing me slowly

There was a time when we were fine
And I could tolerate you
I do believe that you should leave
'Cause I've grown to hate you
Should I be weak and turn my cheek
'Cause I'm scared to fall
But I just don't know you
And you don't know me at all

I've been told that love's a celebration
But I've lost faith through frustration
And it's killing me, but killing me slowly

You paint my picture black
The joke's on me
And I don't wanna laugh
Remember the good times
Won't you bring them back someday, somehow

I don't mind feeling blue
If I could smile just like you do
And it's killing me, killing me slowly

I think you better lock up your daughter

I'll be a kareoke star
Lush strings and Timpani
Have got it in for me
Look how I'm dancing...love

Help me self-medicate

And it's beginning to bore me
Just get on with it
Kill me or cure me

Don't know who I've been with
And I'm gonna take it 'cause they want to give
Can you blame me
Don't need to spend my bread
People do that for me instead
Must be thinking that I'll wake up dead
In the morning
I can't handle shit
And it's beginning to bore me
Just get on with it
Kill me or cure me

Well I've got money for ya
I know I appall ya

Try to screw me or my girlfriend
Until I'm not the latest trend
Fetch me butler

But don't worry it gets better at the chorus"")

I guess now it's time for me to throw up
I feel it's time
Got a picture of you beside me
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup,
Wash it off
Got a fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind me now

[Chorus]
whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood

Unaware but underlined I figured out the story
It wasn't good
And in the corner of a mind I celebrated glory
But it wasn't to be
In the twist of separation you excelled at being free
Can't you find a little room inside for me

[Chorus]

And we'll be together, this time is forever
So complete in our love
We will never be uncovered again

Mosh!

I know I've been taught
To take the blame

Rest assured my angels
Will catch my tears
Walk me out of here

You're homeward bound

On stony ground

The truth is all that you're left with
Twenty paces then at dawn
We will die and be reborn

Have the universe at one with me
Look down the barrel of a gun
And feel the moon replace the sun

Has been lost returned or broken

Is there a tumour in your humour,
Are there bags under your eyes?
Do you leave dents where you sit,
Are you getting on a bit?
Will you survive
You must survive

When there's no love in town
This new century keeps bringing you down
All the places you have been
Trying to find a love supreme
A love supreme

Oh what are you really looking for?
Another partner in your life to
Abuse and to adore?
Is it lovey dovey stuff,
Do you need a bit of rough?
Get on your knees

Yeah turn down the love songs that you hear
'Cause you can't avoid the sentiment
That echoes in your ear
Saying love will stop the pain
Saying love will kill the fear
Do you believe
You must believe
When there's no love in town
This new century keeps bringing you down
All the places you have been
Trying to find a love supreme 
A love supreme

I spy with my little eye
Something beginning with (ah)
Got my back up
And now she's screaming
So I've got to turn the track up
Sit back and watch the royalties stack up
I know this girl she likes to switch teams
And I'm a fiend but I'm living for a love supreme

When there's no love in town
This new century keeps bringing you down
All the places you have been
Trying to find a love supreme
A love supreme

Come and live a love supreme
Don't let it get you down
Everybody lives for love

Come and live a love supreme
Don't let it get you down
Everybody lives for love

Robbie Williams,"And now the end is near
So I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exception

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fails, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh, no, no not me
I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got
If not himself, then he has not
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words he would reveal
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way",My Way [*][Multimedia Track]

Doesn't everyone

I'm gonna drink and stay up very late
And hate the sun

You want your kicks for free
You'll be a rolling stone

Got an A in attitude
Spent money on drugs to suit my mood
I guess I'm just like you

Being young is over-rated
One day I'll be old and understated
But before I'm through....

I'll run naked through the streets
Be a rolling stone
Defiance in defeat, enjoy being alone

I know that you're like me
You want your kicks for free

When we die we'll find out other ways
For getting drunk and throwing it all away
Today is tomorrow and not yesterday

If they knew my name in every home
Kevin Spacey would call on the phone
But I'd be too busy

and your conversation would complement mine

I will talk and Hollywood will listen
See them bow my every word
Mr. Spielberg look just what you're missing
Doesn't that seem a little absurd to bow at my every word

Buy up the rights to my book
And live on a ranch from what the box office took
I go on visit the set
They'll call me their savior
All the people wills come
Celebrity lives on the moon
But I'll be back home in June

Just a jack knife has Mac Heath, dear

Lies a body oozing life
Someone's sneaking round the corner
Is the someone Mack the knife?

From a tug boat by the river
A cement bag's dropping down

So come along for the ride
I hope I'm old before I die

She's not feeling stable, she's unable to breath
Her heart's beating faster, so I ask her to leave
These are strange days we're living in today
Am I straight or gay?

I hope I'm old before I die
I hope I live to see the day the Pope gets high
I hope I'm old before I die
Well tonight I'm gonna live for today
So come along for the ride
I hope I'm old before I die

While these are strange days we're living in today
""C'est la vie"", I say",Old Before I Die
Robbie Williams,"Hold on to this
there's something crawling up my wrist 
I think its dying 
Bless the Lord 
I can't think straight anymore 

You won't see me crying 
There'll be tears before bedtime for sure 

Singing 
I won't go to war 
Lay down your guns 
What are we fighting for 

I want to swim in the ocean 
I want to play in the sea 
I want to love my brother 
Love my brother loving me, me 

I'm gonna buy a farm 
Write a song 
It won't change the earth 
Just the people on it 

I was born with 
A silver shovel in my mouth 
Golden balls and a platinum smile 

You won't hear the last of 
the good, the bad or the brassed off, for sure 

Singing 
I won't go to war 
Lay down your guns 
What are we fighting for 

I want to swim with the dolphins
I want to play in the sea 
I'm gonna love my brother 
Love my brother loving me 

Then buy a farm 
Write a song 
It won't change the earth 
Just the people on it 

Hear the sound of a million people sitting down 
Hip to hip 
Lip to lip 
Free your love 
Free love 
Free love 

Singing I won't go to war 
Lay down your guns 
What are we fighting for 

I want to swim with the dolphins 
I'm gonna play in the sea 
I'm gonna love my brother 
Love my brother loving me, me 

Singing I won't go to war 
Lay down my guns 
What are we fighting for 

I want to play with the dolphins 
I want to play in the sea 
I'm gonna love my brother 
Love my brother loving me, me 

Hear the sound of a million people sitting down 
Hip to hip 
Lip to lip 
Free your love

Robbie Williams,"You wake up in the middle of
The thunder of a scream
And you realise that it was yours
You don't know what to tell them
'Cause you don't know where you've been
And you've been late so many times before

It's only natural to feel like you're sinking
It's only human to be so unprepared

Don't worry baby
If you get a little high
It's just a phase to get you through
Getting by
So you get a little restless
And you get a little wasted
It's just a little light entertainment
Embrace it
It might just save your life

You always say you're sorry
But you never know what for
And it's been happening more and more
Act your age and not your shoe size
And blah blah blah blah blah
That's your role model

Slammin' the door

So it's only natural to feel
The guilt of a nation
It's only human when your young
You're gonna cry

Don't worry baby
If you get a little high
It's just a phase to get you through
Getting by
So you get a little restless
And you get a little wasted
It's just a little light entertainment
Embrace it
It might just save your life

So where else can you go to
Cause no one's given you the book
About what to say and how to feel
And what you should and shouldn't have took
It's feelings that your fearing
That's why you step outside your mind

Don't look back
'Cause if you don't crack
You get to sing this lullaby
You get to sing this lullaby",Get a Little High
Robbie Williams,"Cows
Aah, how peculiar?

I am all of the above, babe
Johnny long strokes to the grave
Saving all the stamps and spend it on a kettle

Rub me rub me up right, lovely
If you lick it, then lick it
Battery good and properly, all night if you want

I haven't got a clue what to do with you
Need for you to love me so much
Jesus, what am I gonna do with this crush?
Just get the old fella and whack it up against her tush
How peculiar?

Bend your long legs against the sofa
In the Dorchester you can keep your hot breath
I'm not into hard sports

Oh I haven't got a clue what to do with you
Jesus, all the things my head is going through
God, what am I gonna do with this crush?
Just whack the the old man out and get it up against your tush
How peculiar?

Jesus, what am I to do man?
I am a depressed man
Not sure what I'm doing all of the day
How peculiar?

I am all of the above man
I have what you want man
If you want me here I am
Come and get it baby
Uh",How Peculiar (Reprise)
Robbie Williams,"I like to reminisce about a time I've never had
A book that no-one read
A film that never made me sad
And you remind of a place I've never been

And something no-one said
When I was 17
One fine day
In the middle of the night

You'll wake up in it
One fine day
In the middle of the night
But you probably won't admit it

Remember when we never struggled through?
A bad time we never had
A love we never fell into
Please don't remind me to forget

'Cause forgiveness is a place
I ain't got used to yet
One fine day
In the middle of the night

You'll wake up in it
One fine day
In the middle of the night
But you probably won't admit it

All I ever wanted
Was to radiate your home
But I guess it doesn't matter
So come reminisce about a time we didn't have

I hear there's a sequel to that film that never made you sad
Don't rewrite my history
'Cause you never really know
How much you didn't mean to me

One fine day
In the middle of the night
You'll wake up in it
One fine day

In the middle of the night
But you probably won't admit it",One Fine Day
Robbie Williams,"It was me and my monkey
Him with his dungarees and Rollerblades
Smoking filter tips reclining in the passenger seat of my supercharged jet black Chevrolet
He had the soft top down
He liked the wind in his face
He said ?Son, you ever been to Vegas?' I said ?No' he said ?That's where we're gonna go, you need a change of place'
And when we hit the strip with all the wedding chapels and the neon signs he said
?I left my wallet in El Segundo' and proceeded to take two grand of mine
We made tracks to the Mandalay Bay hotel
Asked the bell boy if he'd take me and my monkey as well
He looked in the passenger seat of my car and with a smile he said
If your monkey's got that kind of money sir, and we've got a monkey bed'

Me and monkey
With a dream and a gun
Hoping my monkey
Don't point that gun at anyone
Me and monkey
Like Butch and the Sundance Kid
Trying to understand
Why he did what he did
Why he did what he did

And at the elevator I hit the 33rd floor
He had a room up top with a panoramic view it's like nothing you've ever seen before
He went to sleep in the bidet and when he awoke
He ran his little monkey fingers through the yellow pages
Called up escort services and ordered some okie doke
Forty minutes later there came a knock at the door
In walked this big, bad-ass baboon into my bedroom with 3 monkey whores
?Hi, my name is Sunshine. These are my girls. Lace my palm with silver baby oh yeah and they'll rock your world'
So I watched pay per view and polished my shoes and my gun
Was sticking on Kurt Cobain sing about lithium
There came and knocked at the door and in walked Sunshine
What's up, you better get your ass in here boy your monkey is having too much of a good time'

Me and my monkey
Drove in search of the sun
Me and my monkey
Don't point that gun at anyone
Me and my monkey
Like Billy the Kid
Trying to understand
Why he did what he did
Why he did what he did

Got tickets to see Sheena Easton
The monkey was high
Said it was a burning ambition to see her before he died
We left before encores
He couldn't sit still
Sheena was a blast baby
But my monkey was ill
When I played black jack
Kept hittin' 23
Couldn't help but notice this Mexican just staring at me
Or was it my monkey
I couldn't be sure
It's not like you've never seen a monkey in rollerblades and dungarees before
Now don't test my patience cause we're not about to run
That's a bad-ass monkey boy and he's packing a gun
?My name is Rodriguez' he says with death in his eye
?I've been chasing you for a long time amigos
And now your monkey is gonna die'

Me and my monkey
Drove in search of the sun
Me and my monkey
We don't want to kill no Mexican
But we got ten itchy fingers
One thing to declare
When the monkey is high
You do not stare
You do not stare
You do not stare

Looks like we got ourselves a Mexican stand off here boy
And I ain't about to run
Put your gun down boy
How did I get mixed up with this fucking monkey anyhow",Me and My Monkey
Robbie Williams,"Dig your polished nails into the dirt
Rip your skirt off 
Wipe the hurt off
You know it tears my heart out when you 
Flirt with danger 
And any stranger 

You're not as stupid as I look 
Before I could read
You wrote the book 

Cursed
Since your birth dear
And your worst fears 
Have all come true

Held my hand when I got my first tattoo
I was naked when they penetrated
Told everyone I'd slept with you
Thought you liked it and you wouldn't deny it
Saint Peter's gonna be unfaithful
Tell God he's got a dirty angel

Cursed
Since your birth dear
And your worst fears 
Have all come true

Babe you're not the first
Here on earth dear
Cause I'm still here 
And I'm cursed, too
Cursed like you 

Hush
Baby sleep now

We always did

Robbie Williams,"Come and hold my hand
I wanna contact the living
Not sure I understand
This role I've been given
I sit and talk to God
And he just laughs at my plans
My head speaks a language
I don't understand

I just wanna feel
Real love feel the home that I live in
'Cause I got too much life
Running through my veins
Going to waste
I don't wanna die
But I ain't keen on living either
Before I fall in love
I'm preparing to leave her

Scare myself to death
That's why I keep on running
Before I've arrived
I can see myself coming

I just wanna feel
Real love feel the home that I live in
'Cause I got too much life
Running through my veins
Going to waste
And I need to feel
Real love and the love ever after
I cannot get enough

I just wanna feel
Real love feel the home that I live in
I got too much love
Running through my veins
To go to waste

I just wanna feel
Real love and the love ever after
There's a hole in my soul
You can see it in my face
It's a real big place

Come and hold my hand

I know I'm hard to resist
Y'all can come and help me pick the sweetcorn out of this.
It's hard to be humble
When you're so fucking big

I'm gonna milk it till I turn it into cheese
Tell your babes in arms and OAP's
Come take a piece of me

Give in and love it
What's the point in hating me
You can't argue with popularity
Well you could
But you'd be wrong

If you drop me I'll fall to pieces on you
If you don't need me I don't exist
You voted for me
Now let me see a show of hands
Keeping for your stands

Can you make me laugh and sign this autograph
Though it's not for me
Flip a grin, shake a thing, name a shame
Then I'm out of here
It's not very complicated
I'm just young and overrated

Robbie Williams,"You can't manufacture a miracle
The silence was pitiful that day.
A love is getting too cynical
Passion's just physical these days
You analyze everyone you meet
But get no sign, love ain't kind
Every night you admit defeat
And cry yourself blind

[Chorus:]
If you can't wake up in the morning
Cause your bed lies vacant at night
If you're lost, hurt, tired or lonely
Can't control it, try as you might
May you find that love that won't leave you
May you find it by the end of the day
You won't be lost, hurt, tired and lonely
Something beautiful will come your way

The DJ said on the radio
Life should be stereo, each day
In the past you cast the unsuitable
Instead of some kind of beautiful, you just couldn't wait
All your friends think you're satisfied
But they can't see your soul no, no, no
Forgot the time feeling petrified, when they lived alone

[Chorus

Some kind of beautiful (will come your way) [Repeat: x4]

All your friends think you're satisfied
But they can't see your soul no no no
Forgot the time feeling petrified
When they lived alone

Do you still give it away
So get my peeps
To call your peeps 
Cause we've got nothing to say

Don't go to Crenshaw Bouli
Cause Wally can't get fleeced
Gotta love LA

Like a jumbo jet
Too many choices choices 
Gotta love LA

Who ya doin' baby
Don't spoil my day
You've been gloating lately baby 
And I dig LA 
Got nothing to say

But leave your nervous system
With the bouncer on the door
Sell your innocence
For a decade of decadence
Everything all at once all the time is yours

Don't believe in Jesus Christ
Since I believed in your cocaine
All that praying and wailing will leave a stain
So take your Sunday songs and shove it

Hey now, my baby, maybe now we're free
With the appliance of science
We can be anyone we want to be

They'll come bearing you
And charge the earth for it
If you're lucky they'll let you breathe
So scream as you go faster
If that's the world you're after
But make sure you're home for tea

Don't believe in clever people
Clever people drop the bomb
Don't believe your big and evil, they're aliens
So take your rocket science and shove it

Hey now, my baby, maybe now we're free
With the appliance of science
We can be anyone we want to be

I never got much post
So it shouldn't have been too hard
You were on holiday with your school
In some French town
And while you were away
I took Debbie to the crown

I feel as though all the past is closing in on me
I found a photograph
Of me and Kimberley

I found your postcard
And I put it on the wall
I found your picture
You know tears were bound to fall
I didn't write your songs
When we were going out
So why should I start now
You are not about

I feel as though all the past in closing in on me
I found a photograph
Of me and Kimberley

We hardly used to even drink
We didn't smoke
We'd walk home from the pub
'Cause we were always broke
So when your mother called
And said that you were dead
I thought she's talking of
Another Kim instead

I feel as though all the past is closing in on me
I found a photograph
Of me and Kimberley

She said it seemed
You accidentally overdosed
It was so long since I talked to her
And once we were so close
And I am left with all these things
I didn't say
And a picture of you in my arms
The day you went away

And thrown into society
That was the end of you and me
From what we could have been

And if we didn't keep in touch
I guess we didn't care that much
We never understood that stuff
But now I need you

I never meant to let you down
But lettin' you down was easy

Didn't it break your heart
Maybe I'm just too needy
Do any of you still need me
In your lives, in your heart

Don't say yes just to please me
If you're still you and you aren't
But don't say no

We fought together laughed together
Said things that we hoped were clever
The thought of missing you forever
Makes me wanna cry

And now that you've grown up to be
A sentimental memory
Are you still you 'cause I'm still me
At least I hope so

A life beginning somewhere else
It was our time to die

Didn't it break your heart

The storm was blowing through you.

Waiting for god,
To stop this.

And darkness.
Everyone around you was corrupted, 
Say something.

There's no dignity in death,
To sell the world your last breath.
Your still fighting over everything you left,
Oh.

I saw you standing at the gate,
When Marlon Brando passed away.
You had that look upon your face,

And no one learned from your mistakes,

Through your eyes the world was burning,
Please be gentle I'm still learning.

As you kept turning up.

They poisoned you with compromise,
At what point did you realize.
Everybody loves your life,
But you.

No one really gave a damn,

I cannot hear what you say
Except for the occasional word
Sulphates a sentimental sight it bothers me
No longer king of bloke and bird

All of my life
Searching hard
Down in the wires
Of love

Summer me now summer my life away
Summon me onto another day

A hand through the clouds keeps
Knocking me down
It's no less than I deserve
They built museums I don't visit them
I've made enough trouble of my own

Into the night
Searching hard
Look for the light
Of love

Summer me now summer my life away
Summon me on to another day

Summer the evening, winter ways
Are falling down again

Makes life worth living

Tell a joke
Tell it twice
If no one else is laughing there why am I
I split myself both times and laugh till I cry
Oh Lord, please make me pure 
But not yet

I don't have to try 
I just dial it in

I got a ton of selfish genes and lazy bones 
Beneath this skin

But not yet

I've got one hand in my pocket but the other one looks cool as hell 
I know I'm gonna die so my revenge is living well 
Oh Lord, make me pure 
But not yet

So I hope this song will do 
I wrote it all for you 
I'm not perfect but you don't mind that, do you? 
I know you're there to pull me through, aren't you? 

So I look for love 
I like the search 
And I'll be standing for election all across the known universe 
Let every president get the country she deserves 
Oh Lord, make me pure

So she walks into this dead end bar
Puts hers handbag on the chair
And she weights the words we shared
When we were fifteen and still cared
'Cause she feels I'm a scar from the wound

Don't let your dreams out of your head
Stick it to the man instead
Don't fool your heart lying about

Did you try to change your life?
Did you ever try to change your life?
You repeat and repeat
And repeat and repeat
Now what's up with that?

Now she loves somebody else
In flash clothes
She was the girl with the acid stare
And now she'd pay to have one of those

And she weighs the word she says
And she knows you exist
Now she feels
I'm the scar from the wound

All is wonderful in this life,
Dreaming of the sun she warms.
You should see me in the afterlife,
Picking up the songs of lures.

What you think is work because I'm adoring.
You don't want the truth, truth is boring.
I've got this fever need to,
Leave the house,
Leave the car,
Leave the bad men where they are,
I'll leave a few shells in my gun,
And stop me starring at the sun.

Leave the car,
Leave the bad men where they are,

And stop me starring at the sun.

Robbie Williams,"Some will sing a song to reel 'em in
It's a song I sung before and a song I'm gonna sing again
I mean every word, I don't mean a single one of them
Oh Lord, make me pure but not yet

Tell a joke, tell it twice
If no one else is laughing there, why am I?
I split myself both times and laugh until I cry
Oh Lord, please make me pure but not yet

I don't have to try, I just dial it in
I've never found a job that for me was worth bothering
I got a ton of selfish genes and lazy bones beneath this skin
Oh Lord, make me pure but not yet

Smoking kills, sex sells
I've got one hand in my pocket but the other one looks cool as hell
I know I'm gonna die, so my revenge is living well
Oh Lord, make me pure but not yet

I stopped praying so I hope this song will do
I wrote it all for you
I'm not perfect but you don't mind that, do you?
I know you're there to pull me through, aren't you?

So I look for love, I like the search
And I'll be standing for election all across the known universe
Every president gets the country she deserves
Oh Lord, make me pure but not yet

And I've been seeing somebody's wife
She said she'd leave him for me and I said that wasn't wise
You can't lie to a liar because of all the lies

Robbie Williams,"There's no earthly way of knowing
What was in your heart when it stopped going
The whole world shook
A storm was blowing through you

Waiting for God to stop this
And up to your neck in darkness
Everyone around you was corrupted
Say something

There's no dignity in death
To sell the world your last breath
We're still fighting
Over everything you left

I saw you standing at the gates
When Marlon Brando passed away
You had that look upon your face
Advertising space

No one learned from your mistakes
We let our prophets go to waste
All that's left in any case
Is advertising space

Through your eyes the world was burning
""Please be gentle, I'm still learning""
You seemed to say as you kept turning up

They poisoned you with compromise
But at what point did you realize
Everybody loves your life but you?

A special agent for the man
Through Watergate and Vietnam
No one really gave a damn
Do you think the C.I.A. did?

I saw you standing at the gates
When Marlon Brando passed away
You had that look upon your face
Advertising space

No one learned from your mistakes
We let our prophets go to waste
All that's left in any case
Is advertising space

No one learned from your mistakes

Robbie Williams,"It was me and my monkey
Him with his dungarees and roller blades
Smoking filter tips reclining in the passenger seat of my supercharged jet black Chevrolet
He had the soft top down 
He liked the wind in his face
He said ""Son, you ever been to Vegas?' 
I said ""No"" he said ""That's where we're gonna go, you need a change of place""
And when we hit the strip with all the wedding chapels and the neon signs he said 
""I left my wallet in El Segundo"" and proceeded to take two grand of mine
We made tracks to the Mandalay Bay hotel 
Asked the bell boy if he'd take me and my monkey as well
He looked in the passenger seat of my car and with a smile he said
""If your monkey's got that kind of money sir, and we've got a monkey bed""

Me and monkey 
With a dream and a gun
Hoping my monkey
Don't point that gun at anyone
Me and monkey 
Like Butch and the Sundance Kid
Trying to understand 
Why he did what he did 
Why he did what he did

And at the elevator I hit the 33rd floor
He had a room up top with a panoramic view it's like nothing you've ever seen before
He went to sleep in the bidet and when he awoke
He ran his little monkey fingers through the yellow pages 
Called up escort services and ordered some oki doke
Forty minutes later there came a knock at the door
In walked this big, bad-ass baboon into my bedroom with 3 monkey whores 
""Hi, my name is Sunshine. 
These are my girls. 
Lace my palm with silver baby oh yeah and they'll rock your world""
So I watched pay per view and polished my shoes and my gun
Was sticking on Kurt Cobain sing about lithium
There came and knocked at the door and in walked Sunshine 
""What's up?""
""You better get your ass in here boy your monkey is having too much of a good time""

Me and my monkey
Drove in search of the sun
Me and my monkey
Don't point that gun at anyone 
Me and my monkey 
Like Billy the Kid
Trying to understand 
Why he did what he did 
Why he did what he did

Got tickets to see Sheena Easton
The monkey was high
Said it was a burning ambition to see her before he died
We left before encores
He couldn't sit still 
Sheena was a blast baby
But my monkey was ill
When I played black jack 
Kept hittin' 23
Couldn't help but notice this Mexican just staring at me
Or was it my monkey
I couldn't be sure
It's not like you've never seen a monkey in rollerblades and dungarees before 
Now don't test my patience cause we're not about to run 
That's a bad-ass monkey boy and he's packing a gun
""My name is Rodriguez"" he says with death in his eye
""I've been chasing you for a long time amigos
And now your monkey is gonna die""

Me and my monkey
Drove in search of the sun
Me and my monkey
We don't want to kill no Mexican 
But we got ten itchy fingers 
One thing to declare
When the monkey is high
You do not stare 
You do not stare
You do not stare

Looks like we got ourselves a Mexican stand off here boy
And I ain't about to run 
Put your gun down boy 
How did I get mixed up with this fucking monkey anyhow",Me and My Monkey [Abbey Road 2003]

Learned how to skive
Polo mints to hide my breath from my mum
Did a little weed cause it felt like fun
Did a little bit of speed if my friend had some
Nicked Volkswagen badges I'm a Beastie Boys son
Me so horny, me so young and I still get my washing done
Auntie Joe died of cancer God didn't have an answer
Rhythm was a dancer
Any room for a chancer? That's me in the corner, thanks sir!
I wore a troop track suit, British Knights shoes, Kangol hat like LL Cool's
Before I was 'avin it, 'avin it large
They nicked the BMX from out my garage
Knew it was Tier from off the estate cuz every time he'd see me, he'd smile like we were mates
From then on in I'd have to walk to me Nan's
And I'd dream my dreams through a sea of prams
Like a hooligan on the football stands
And I'd throw the v's to Leeds and West Ham
Then I ran, I ran so far away down Scotia Road to a taxi bay
Then I ran again cuz I couldn't pay, a Muslim didn't get his fare that day
I apologize today

Things are better when they start
That's how the 80s broke my heart

And who are you calling poof? You like Wham, man, I hate that stuff
And then my grandad died and left a hole in the family and lots of women had to nanny me
School was a laugh, they didn't have ADD, thick was the term they used for me

I cried, she cried, we cried, her youth died
Drank cider in the cemetery
The year above us had discovered E and I said it weren't for me
?12.50? I could rob me mum's purse and buy one off chalcky
Met a girl on Monday, drank fizzy pop on Tuesday
Fingered her on Wednesday and on Thursday and Friday and on Saturday
Dumped by Sunday

Things are better when they start
That's how the 80s broke my heart
The wonder years, I've played my part
That's how the 80s broke my heart

Like I said, I lost my virginity to a girl called Anne-Marie, well she said she fancied me
And then she said ""fuck me"" and I thought 'fuck me, I'm all talk and it'll be over too quickly'
And it was but I couldn't care less, I'd seen a girl's part,made a mess on her dress, oh yes!
You're now rocking with the best, second person in my year that had seen a breast
I'm in my 30s now and I'm still impressed
Where are the Falklands mum? And what have they done?
Where do girls come from? Where do girls come from? Where do girls come from?

I got no GCSEs, nothing higher than a D,
I couldn't tell me mum because she'd batter me
Me and Tate sat on the bowling green, life is a shitter
We had five quid between us and bought six cans of bitter
I took me ten Benson home and I smoked through the sorrow
If I could just avoid me mum maybe I'll tell her tomorrow
I stumbled through the door and said ""Mum, it's like this.""
She said ""That man's been on the phone and you've made the list!
You're in that boy band, son, come and giz a kiss!""
Phoned up Martin and Rich and carried on getting pissed
""Boys I don't believe it, I'm gonna be famous!
Pick you up in a Porsche and buy you lots of trainers.""
I met the other guys, one seemed like a cock
I think it's gonna be like New Kids on The Block

I hate those that hate me
I cant forgive and it's crazy, baby

I played snooker with me dad he said ""Don't be a dick!
Unload the bullets, your mind is a gun,
You're gonna shoot yourself when they're number one!""

I cant be bothered, cause I'm lazy
I hate those that hate me
I cant forgive and it's crazy, baby
Now I'm a video star
Do you know who you are, baby?

(I only wanted to get down
I'm making trouble in this town
For the five of us)

Now it's dinner with Versace, lunch with Princess Diana
And I'm gonna get battered if I go out in my manor
Because as much as we were loved we were also hated
The boys got jealous cause the girls got plated
Now we're famous and that, and we're dancing and that
And I'm thinking ""I can sing, Why am I stood at the back?""
So fuck the band give me Sambuca and gak
We're all a bag of nerves and not a band of brothers

I cant be bothered, cause I'm lazy
I hate those that hate me
I cant forgive and it's crazy, baby
Now I'm a video star
Do you know who you are, baby?

(I only wanted to get down
I'm making trouble in this town
For the five of us)

And now it's breaking my heart because the dream's turned to shit
It ain't broke but I'll break it in a little bit
And I'm always in trouble but I've stopped saying sorry
Everybody's worried ""What the fuck's wrong with Robbie?
He's not answering his phone, he's not talking to me
I saw him on the telly at Glastonbury.""
And now I'm running away from everything that I've been
And I'm pissed and I'm fucked and I'm only nineteen
I can't conform no more, I can't perform no more
But the boys know I'm fucked and so they show me the door
And if truth be told I wasn't fit enough to stay
So I put my head down and walked away.

That was the 90s; 90 to 95

I cant be bothered, cause I'm lazy
I hate those that hate me
I cant forgive and it's crazy, baby
Now I'm a video star
Do you know who you are, baby?

Robbie Williams,"When he saw her getting off the bus
It seemed to wipe away the years
Her face was older, just a little rough
But her eyes were still so clear
He drank his coffee and he hurried out
Across before she walked away
Then he approached her like a little child
Too scared for what he had to say

""Hello Louise,
Remember me?
Now should we part
Or stay awhile?
As if we were still lovers""

She took a moment just to recognise the man she'd known so well before
And as he started to apologise
Lose any bitterness she bore
She gently put her finger on his lips
To let him know she understood
And with her suitcase standing on the floor
Embraced him like a lover would

He told louise
""You look so good
It's just you see
You make me feel
As if we were still lovers""

It's not always true that time heals all wounds
There are wounds that you don't wanna heal
The memories of something really good
Something truly real, that you never found again

As if we were still lovers

And though they talked just for just a little time
Before she said she had to go
He saw the meeting as a tiny sign
That told him all he had to know

And so Louise
Waved from the bus
And as she left
She gave that smile
As if they were still lovers

Robbie Williams,"We're the Pet Shop Boys
Suburbia's a slipstream
To a memory
Of a time when you were
Close to me
I pretend
I'm there again
I close my eyes and see you
Better than before
Then I feel you touch me
And it's 1984
I know what you will say
Before you start
In my heart

We're the Pet Shop Boys
We're the Pet Shop Boys

Every thought's a fashion
Or a crime
And every boy is just
A waste of time
But I pretend
It was different then
Maybe it's a habit
Maybe it's a sin
But I find out
When I try it on
It crawls beneath my skin
Once it gets inside me
It won't go
Now I know

We're the Pet Shop Boys
We're the Pet Shop Boys

Rent
Shopping
Being boring
It's alright
It's a sin
I'm not scared
In denial
I want a dog
I want a lover
Can you forgive her?
Do I have to?
What have I? What have I?
What have I done to deserve this?

Cellophane around my mouth
Stops the anger sipping out

Gravy in the mud

Sometimes I wish I could
But I can't behave

I know it's not the heathen in me
It's just that I've been bleeding lately,
Internally
Don't turn to me,
Bite your tongue, the torrid weapon
You could learn a useful lesson

What's so great about the Great Depression
Is it a blast for you?
Blasphemy

Words cut like a knife through Vaseline
You can't really mean what you mean
When you say what you say
So tourettes make them come out that way,
Wish I was here well I wish you weren't
Your gift of anger's better burnt
If nothing's said then nothing's learnt
I though I wasn't but I'm really hurting

We like it different we like it strange in our own way we haven't changed
I got my eyes made up at the bus stop by my girlfriend and you know what,
She likes me different she likes me strange in her own way she's just the same

[Chorus: x2]
Psycho evolution your pollution makes it difficult for weirdos,
Just another humanoid reaction to the voices in this town
Every Saturday at the plaza guess the gender unless you'd rather,
He is a lesbian but that's ok she is the center of attention for another day
In the universe we are magenta you can join us if you enter,
Because you're different and you are strange in your own way you're just the same

Time isn't lost where devotion is I never wasted a life,
Space is the place where the soul is far from the safe and the norm
In the off stream they call it cavarade but they'll say that won't they,
I want it different I like it strange in my own way I haven't changed
It's insulting to be mislead by the hairdo of a god head
They show reverence but that's OK we are the center of the universe anyway

To float in a space is just a thought
The morning brings a mystery
The evening makes it history
Tell me how do you rate the morning sun?

Sadly passed away,
It was a shame I never knew his name
I wonder if he sat there every morning

Watched the sunrise

It's just too heavy for me
And all I wanted was the world
If you were the star let in the sun
Don't go wasting your time
Cause there is no finish line

Robbie Williams,"I hope there's a golden age
I pray for my sanity
Where we don't have to answer to anyone 'bout anything

This is not like a brochure
Flying cars and sex machines
We are all so compliant
'Cause everything is what it seems
And it can't be the satellite
To tell you how loved you are
Or some kind of live device that holds you when you've gone too far

And I don't feel myself again
I thought I'd be fixed by now
Walking through the horizon, I found myself back here somehow
Give me something to die for
Or design a quiet mind
Something to like mankind for
Cause we don't lie, my heart and I.

You've been bending so long now
You think it's standing up
And they line up behind you to build you up, buttercup
We can lose all meaning
Quicker than a credit card
And not everyone's healing, so try your best and don't love too hard
Cause they can't build a satellite
To tell you what's in your heart
Or some kind of live device that holds you when you've gone too far

And I don't feel myself again
I thought I'd be fixed by now
Walking through the horizon, I found myself back here somehow
Give me something to die for
Or design a quiet mind
Something to like mankind for
Cause we don't lie, my heart and I.

Will I ever feel the waking
Naked as a lullaby
Don't ask me to explain again
I can't lie to my heart and I

And I don't feel myself again
I thought I'd be fixed by now
Walking through the horizon, I found myself back here somehow
Give me something to die for
Or design a quiet mind
Something to like mankind for
Cause we don't lie, my heart and I.

My heart and I
My heart and I

I've been feeling so lonely
Feeling so low
So low I almost let go.",Heart and I
Robbie Williams,"Well there‚Äôs three versions of this story mine and yours
And then the truth
Now we can put it down to circumstance, our childhood, then our youth
Out of some sentimental gain I wanted you to feel my pain,
But it came back return to sender
I read your mind and tried to call,
My tears could fill the Albert Hall,
Is this the sound of sweet surrender?

What a shame we never listened
I told you through the television
And all that went away was the price we paid
People spend a lifetime this way
Oh what a shame.

So I got busy throwing everybody underneath the bus, oh
And with your poster 30 foot high at the back of Toys-R-Us
I wrote a letter in my mind,
But the words were so unkind,
About a man I can‚Äôt remember
I don‚Äôt recall the reasons why,
I must have meant them at the time
Is this the sound of sweet surrender?

What a shame we never listened
I told you through the television
And all that went away was the price we paid
People spend a lifetime this way
And that‚Äôs how they stay
Oh what a shame.

Words come easy
When they‚Äôre true
Words come easy
When they‚Äôre true

So I got busy throwing everybody underneath the bus
And with your poster 30 foot high at the back of Toys-R-Us
Now we can put it down to circumstance, our childhood then our youth.

Robbie Williams,"Save me from drowning in the sea
Beat me up on the beach
What a lovely holiday
There's nothing funny left to say

This sombre song would drain the sun
But it won't shine until it's sung
No water running in the stream
The saddest place we've ever been

Everything I touched was golden
Everything I loved got broken
On the road to Mandalay
Every mistake I've ever made
Has been rehashed and then replayed
As I got lost along the way

There's nothing left for you to give
The truth is all that you're left with
Twenty paces then at dawn
We will die and be reborn

I like to sleep beneath the trees
Have the universe at one with me
Look down the barrel of a gun
And feel the moon replace the sun

Everything we've ever stolen
Has been lost returned or broken
No more dragons left to slay
Every mistake I've ever made
Has been rehashed and then replayed

Her rainbows, and her ponies

How she got lots of different horses
By lots of different men

Liberate your sons and daughters
The bush is high
But in the hole there's water
You can get some, when they give it
Nothing sacred, but it's a living

Hey ho here she goes
Either a little too high or a little too low
Got no self-esteem and vertigo
'Cause she thinks she's made of candy
Hey ho here she goes
Either a little too loud or a little too close
There's a hurricane in the back of her throat
And she thinks she's made of candy

Ring a ring of roses
Whoever gets the closest
She comes and she goes
As the war of the roses
Mother was a victim
Father beat the system
By moving bricks to Brixton
And learning how to fix them
Liberate your sons and daughters

But in the hole there's water
As you win
She'll be the Hollywood love
And if it don't feel good
What are you doing this for

Expendable soldiers smiling at anything
Raised on a feeling our lives would have meaning eventually

We were once the answer and then you discover
You're actually just one thing after another
And what was the question and why was the lesson so deafening?

This is all that matters now
And that was all that happened anyhow
You can look back but don't stare
Maybe I can love you out of there

And when I went away what I forgot to say
Was all I had to say:
Eight letters, three words, one meaning

And outside forces didn't make it easy
So I thought I'd go before you leave me
Self-preservation was no explanation for anything

But the truth is more than we'll ever comprehend
I'm just starting to understand, my friend
All of that distance, 'cause I fell in love with the enemy

You took my youth, you took my health,
And if you're not here I find myself
You're supposed to make this better, better, better
No self-control and no reason why,
If I don't change, then we both die,
This is it for you and I.

Blisters at the end of my fingertips,
Praying to a god I don't think exist
Will you listen now?
Can you forgive me somehow?

This time I'll be different, I promise you,
This time I'll be special, you know I will,
Just don't leave with me in your eyes.
This time I'll be better, I want you to know,
This time I'll be special, oh God, make it so,
Just don't leave with me in your eyes, your eyes, your eyes

Closer now to the end,
If love was the answer,
Then hope was the question
Closer now, let's pretend
We've never been out here before.

This time I'll be different, I promise you,
This time I'll be special, you know I will,
don't leave with me in your eyes.
This time I'll be better, I want you to know,
This time I'll be special, oh God, make it so,
Just don't leave with me in your eyes, your eyes, your eyes",Different

I'm longing to linger till dawn dear

Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you

Robbie Williams,"You're gonna meet some strangers.
Welcome to the zoo.
Bitter disappointments.
Except for one or two.
Some of them are angry.
Some of them are mean.
Most of them are twisted.
Few of them are clean.

Now when you go dancing with young men down at the disco.
Just keep it simple.
You don't have to kiss though.
Don't waste time whit the idiots
Think that they're heroes.
They will betray you.
Stick with us weirdos.

For all your days and nights
I'm gonna be there,
I'm gonna be there, yes I will.
Go gentle through your life.
If you want me I'll be there.
When you need me I'll be there for you.

Don't try to make them love you.
Don't answer every call.
Baby be a giant.
Let the world be small.
Some of them are deadly.
Some don't let it show.
If they try and hurt you.
Just let your daddy know.

Now when you go
Giving your heart make sure they deserve it.
If they haven't earned it.
Keep searching, it's worth it.

For all your days and nights (days and night)
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there)
I'm gonna be there, yes I will.
Go gentle through your life (through your life)
If you want me I'll be there (If you want me I'll be there)
When you need me I'll be there for you.

Go gentle to the light (to the light)
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there)

And ask if he could get away and meet me 
And maybe grab a bite to eat 
And he drops what he's doing and hurry's down to meet me 
And I'm always late 
He sits waiting patiently and smiles when he first sees me 
Because he's made that way 
And if that's not loving me

I know I promised I wouldn't leave here without you
Please, don't let me go
While they play the last song ever
The last chance to hold each other forever

Hold me now, I've still got words worth hearing
I just wanna be a human being
Hold me now, we all know what I'm fearing
I think I see the light, am I disappearing?

Was I just because
A mistake in love
Two people who stop trying enough
Don't want a brand new life
This one's just right
Why would I throw it all away?

Won't you hold me now?
Just before I stop breathing
I know I promised I wouldn't leave here without you
Please, don't let me go
While they play the last song ever

Then you grab the handle and turn the knife

Robert Berry,"Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby, picks up the rice
In the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face 
That she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie, writing the words
Of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks
In the night when there's nobody there
What does he care

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby, died in the church
And was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie, wiping the dirt
From his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?",Eleanor Rigby
