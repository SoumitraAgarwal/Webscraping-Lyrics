Chris Barber,"""I'm the Sheik of Araby, 
Your love belongs to me.
At night when you're asleep 
Into your tent I'll creep.
The stars that shine above,
Will light our way to love.
You'll rule this land with me;",The Sheik of Araby
Chris Barber,"Want you to know I go for your squeezin'
Want you to know it really is pleasin'
Want you to know  I ain't for no teasin'
 
Treat me sweet and gentle when you say goodnight 
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me
I get sentimental when you hold me tight 
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me 
Missing you since you went away
Singing the blues away each day
Counting the rights and waiting for you 
I'm in the mood to let you know 
I never knew I loved you so 
Please say you love me too 
When I get this feelin' I'm in ecstasy
So squeeze me but please don't tease me
 
Treat me sweet and gentle when you say goodnight 
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me

Chris Barber,"Sophisticated lady tryin' to change my ways
Just because you're caught in your social maze
I think it's 'bout time that you realize
Your money and your power's got you mesmerized

Pretty lady, get back
Pretty lady, yea
Sophisticated lady put your blue jeans on
You're anybody's baby when your mama's gone

Educated lady with your college degree
Amazes me why you just can't see
Learned everything from your books on the shelf
But no one ever taught you how to think for yourself

Pretty lady, get back
Pretty lady, yea, sweet thing
Sophisticated lady put your blue jeans on
You're anybody's baby when your mama's gone

Sophisticated lady take a lesson from me
I can help you be what you want to be
Together we'll see many brighter days
If it takes forever, gonna change your ways

Chris Barber,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 

Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 
Oh lady be good to me.","Oh, Lady Be Good"
Chris Barber,"I saw a blind man,
He was a kind man,
Helping a fellow along,
One could not see,
One could not walk,
But they both were humming this song;
 
When you're smiling, When you're smiling, 
The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you.
 
I used to worry,
I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,
Learned wrong from right,
And you'll never hear me complain;
 
When you're smiling, When you're smiling, 
The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,",When You're Smiling
Chris Barber,"You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die. 

You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes

Chris Barber,"Let's look up as we walk, so that the tears don't spill
Remembering that spring day, that lonely night.
Let's look up as we walk, count the blurry stars
Remembering that summer day, that lonely night.

Happiness is above the clouds, 
Happiness is above the skies.
Let's look up as we walk, so that the tears don't spill
Crying as we walk, that lonely night.
Remembering that autumn day, that lonely night.

Sadness is in the shadow of the clouds, 
Sadness is in the shadow of the moon.
Let's walk with our head held up so that the tears don't spill, 
Crying as we walk, that lonely night.",When the Saints Go Marching In
Chris Barber,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues

Chris Barber,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose

Chris Barber,"'t was on the Isle of Capri that I found her 
Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree 
Oh, I can still see the flowers blooming round her 
Where we met on the Isle of Capri 

She was as sweet as a rose at the dawning 
But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me 
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning 
Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri 

Summertime was nearly over 
Blue Italian sky above 
I said ""Lady, I'm a rover, 
Can you spare a sweet word of love?"" 

She whispered softly ""It's best not to linger"" 
And then as I kissed her hand I could see 
She wore a lovely meatball on her finger 
't was goodbye at the villa Capri

Chris Barber,"I met you in a garden in an old Kentucky town
The sun was shining down
You wore a gingham gown
I kissed you as I placed a yellow tulip in your hair
Upon my coat you pinned a rose so rare
Time has not changed your loveliness
You're just as sweet to me
I love you yet, I can't forget the days that used to be
 
When you wore a tulip, a sweet yellow tulip
And I wore a big red rose
When you caressed me, 'twas then Heaven blessed me
What a blessing, no one knows
You made life cheery when you called me dearie
'Twas down where the blue grass grows
Your lips were sweeter then julep when you wore that tulip

In the morning and started to laugh

This is, this is the, huh, this is the first song I ever learned, actually 
Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts
Lordy, how they could love

Swore to be true to each other
Yeah, true to the skies above
He was her man, wouldn't do her no wrong 
And Frankie and Johnny went walkin'

And Johnny had on a new suit
Yeah, Frankie spent one-hundred dollar notes
Just to make her man look cute
He was her man, he wouldn't do her no wrong 

Frankie went over to the barroom
Stopped for a bottle of beer
Said to the old bartender man
Has my lover Johnny man been here?

He was my man, Lord, but he'd been doin' me wrong, so wrong. 
Yeah Frankie looked over the transom door
And then to her great surprise
There sat her lover man Johnny

Makin' love to Nellie Bly
He was her man, but he was doin' her wrong 
Well Frankie lifted up her kimono dress
And she drew (ladaladalala) out a little .44 

She shot once, twice, three times (three times) she shot him
And through that hardwood (door) floor
Yeah she shot her man (yeah he was her man)
Well but he been doin' her wrong yeah 

He said, roll me over so careful ah
Roll me over so slow,
Oh roll me on to my left hand side,
Because your bullet hurt me so,

I was your man, but I been doin' you wrong. 
Play it Chris! 
 
Well they sent for Frankie's mother
Come down to Huddy's saloon
To see what's the matter with her boy
She come down, Frankie looked up at her

Here what she said: 
She said, Oh Mrs. Johnson, oh forgive me please
Well I killed your lovin' son, Johnny
But I'm down on my bended knee

I shot your man, 'cause he was doin' me wrong. ah 
She said, I'll forgive you Frankie,
She said, I'll forgive you not, not
For killin' my lovin' son Johnny,

He's the only support that I've got,
'Cause you shot my man and he was doin' you wrong. 
Well the last time I seen Frankie
She was a-sittin' in a dungeon cell

She would be there moanin', herself
With no one there to care
She shot her man, a he'd been doin' her wrong, so wrong 
Well bring out the overtime hearse all day long

You gotta bring out the pony and truck hey
They're gonna take Johnny, Johnny to the cemetery (graveyard)
And they ain't never coming back
Oh he was her man, oh but he been doin' her wrong, so wrong 

Well the story ain't got no moral, Lordy
But the story ain't got no end
Well the story only goes to show
That there ain't no damn good in men

He was her man, but he was doin' her wrong
Yeah, ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba",Frankie and Johnny

Chris Barber,"A time to be reapin', a time to be sowin'.
The green leaves of Summer are callin' me home.
'Twas so good to be young then, in a season of plenty,
When the catfish were jumpin' as high as the sky.

A time just for plantin', a time just for ploughin'.
A time to be courtin' a girl of your own.
'Twas so good to be young then, to be close to the earth,
And to stand by your wife at the moment of birth.

A time to be reapin', a time to be sowin'.
The green leaves of Summer are callin' me home.
'Twas so good to be young then, with the sweet smell of apples,
And the owl in the pine tree a-winkin' his eye.

A time just for plantin', a time just for ploughin'.
A time just for livin', a place for to die.
'Twas so good to be young then, to be close to the earth,
Now the green leaves of Summer are callin' me home.

Now the green leaves of Summer are callin' me home.",The Green Leaves of Summer
Chris Barber,"There's a sunny little funny little melody
That was started by a native down in Waikiki
He would gather a crowd down beside the sea
And they'd play his gay Hawaiian chant
Soon the other little natives started singin' it
And the hula hula maidens started swingin' it
Like a tropical storm that's the way it hit
Funny little gay Hawaiian Chant
Ow way tah tualan Me big bad fightin' man
Tho it started on an island down Hawaii way
It's as popular in Tennessee or Ioway
If you wander into any cabaret
You will hear this gay Hawaiian Chant",Hawaiian War Chant

It must go to someone of course
It can't be sister or brother
And so I love my horse
But horses are frequently silly
Mine ran from the beach of Okhala
And left me alone for a filly
So I have picked you up

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will, you've made your kill
Cause you took advantage of me
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me.

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today

Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye

Chris Barrett,"The colors of my life, are bountiful and bold
The purple glow of indigo, the gleam of green and gold
The splendor of a sunrise, the dazzle of a flame
The glory of a rainbow, I put 'em all to shame

No quiet browns or grays, I'll take my days instead
And fill them 'til they overflow, with rose and cherry red
And should this sunlit world, grow dark one day
The colors of my life will leave a shining light to show the way

The colors of my life, are softer than a breeze
The silver gray of [Incomprehensible] the dappled green of trees
Amber of a wheat field, hazel of a seed
Crystal of a raindrop are all I'll ever need

Your reds are much too bold, in gold I find no worth
I fill my days with [Incomprehensible] brown, the colors of the earth
And if from by my side my love should roam
The colors of my life will shine a quiet light to lead her home

Chris Barrett,"Please please play my music for me,
I'm not sure of the words yet;
Huh, I'm not sure of anything!

Life is very rough and tumble for a humble siseuse;
One can betray one's troubles never, whatever occurs!
Night after night,
Have to be bright,
Whether you're well or ill;
The people have to laugh their fill,
You mustn't sleep till dawn comes creeping.

Though I never really grumble,
Life's a jumble indeed!
And in my efforts to succeed
I've had to formulate a creed.

I believe in doing what I can,
In crying when I must
And laughing when I choose.
Heigh ho!
If love were all I should be lonely!

I believe the more you love a man,
The more you give your trust,
The more you're bound to lose;
Although, when shadows fall I think if only
Somebody splendid really needed me,
Somebody affectionate and dear,
Cares would be ended
If I knew that he wanted to have me near.

But I believe that, since my life began,
The most I've had is just a talent to amuse,
Heigh ho!
If love were all!

Chris Bathgate,"I was a lonely little child
On the banks of a river wide
She was most beautiful and blue
And had rest on the other side
Unfurling foam
Far from every stone
And the trees began to sway
Lost my life in a roaring river wide
Just to be with you that day

No bridge, no boat
No way to stay afloat
As I began to cross
I was caught and kept in a current that could crush

And within the waves was lost
As my arms feigned and the water overcame
The waves began to sing
And in my ears, I swear to you my dear
Was a lovely silver ring

I was a lonely little child
In love with a silvery sound
Would you shed a tear for me my dear
For on that day I drowned",Riverwide

'Cause I know where I'm gonna be tonight

That nothing said

The tight tightness in my chest rest and subsides
In one dull dawn with a hum that split its length
Does my name sting your tongue now does it babe
Your thin frame has set my eyes to fray
On our dim stretch of this street, how it aches
For every gray and sad hemmed heart to coil
And our frail eyes and their whites to finally toll
Now one brash phrase could crush this fragile day
As my thoughts swirl in some shrill sad cannonade
The one such spur that caused my throat to creak
The one dull dawn I've sentenced to repeat",Serpentine

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?

And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try

But now it's too late.

I thought I'd found the girl of my dreams, 
Now it seems, 
This is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
I thought for once it couldn't go wrong, 
Not for long, 
I can see the way this ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
Why should I care though she gave me the air,
Why should I cry, 
Heave a sigh, 
And wonder why, 
And wonder why?
I thought I found the gal I could trust, 
What a bust, this is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be just friends?""",Can't We Be Friends

Round and round I go

I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

You might lose a lot

Why not",Why Not
Chris Botti,"Old enough to be her dad
But the young men were just mad they nursed their grievances
And she was flattered by his charm
It wouldn't do her any harm they all had their chances

He sent her flowers and limousines
She was treated like a queen
Anything she ever wanted
It was no problem for a man like him
And everyone expected soon
That she could ask him for the moon if she would wear his ring

Knowing glances from his friends
In the homes at the weekends of high society
But he didn't give a damn
He never felt more like a man
And all the time the clock was ticking

And all would envy
The older man and his beautiful young wife
Yes all would envy

In a house upon a hill
She was there with time to kill
She lived a life she'd only dreamed
The life was never what it seemed
To all her friends that she'd ignored
She denied that she was bored
She had no time for dancing - no time for dancing

But the clock upon the wall
That was ticking in the hall always reminded her
That life was going on elsewhere 
But she was happy and she whould swear she wouldn't change a thing

And all would envy
The older man and his beautiful young wife
Yes all would envy

Now its five o'clock am
She must have spent the night again with that old friend of hers
She loves to dance

She's missing more and more these days
But he's still stuck in his old ways
Perhaps she needs a little more romance
But the clock upon the wall is still ticking in the hall
She must be home soon - soon

Where a younger man would weep
He takes a pill and goes to sleep

Now who would envy the older man and his beautiful young wife?
Who would envy?  Who would envy?",All Would Envy

Chris Botti,"I really don?t want much for Christmas
Maybe just peace and while you?re listening
It couldn?t hurt and might be nice
If what the season brings could last beyond one silent night

I really don?t want much for Christmas
No, hunger?s high upon my wish list
No fancy toys, please give instead
A roof above each homeless child?s head

It?s all so grand and jolly
We deck the halls with boughs of holly
Yuletide carols and cozy fires
But somewhere there?s no rejoicing

I really don?t want much for Christmas
You could lose hate and I?d be blissful
Make all the madness disappear
That?s it for what I wish
No diamond-studded gifts
I really don?t want much this year but love

That David played and it pleased the Lord

The baffled king composing hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you

She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Well baby I've been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you

I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

There was a time you let me know
What's real and going on below
But now you never show it to me, do you?

And remember when I moved in you?
The holy dark was moving too
And every breath we drew was hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
And all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you

And it's not a cry you can hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And mail it right away

And pretend that he is Parson Brown

I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone
But here you are with the dawn

Wish I'd forget you, but you're here to stay
It seems I met you when my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you
Good morning heartache, what's new

Stop haunting me now
Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning heartache, here we go again
Good morning heartache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hanging around
Good morning heartache, sit down

Stop haunting me now
Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Is in your eyes
A look your smile can't

Well it takes my breath away

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

Chris Botti,"Così comanda Turandot
Questa notte nessun dorma in Pechino!
Nessun dorma! Nessun dorma!
Nessun dorma! Nessun dorma!
Tu pure, o Principessa
Nella tua fredda stanza
Guardi le stelle che tremano
Dall'amore e di speranza!

Ma il mio mistero e chiuso in me
Il nome mio nessun saprà!
No, no, sulla tua bocca lo dirò
Quando la luce splenderà!
Ed il mio bacio scioglierà
Il silenzio che ti fa mia!

ll nome suo nessun saprà
E noi dovrem, ahimè! Morir! Morir!

Chris Botti,"Qui dove il mare luccica
E tira forte vento
Sulla vecchia terazza
Davanti al golfo di surriento

Un uomo abbraccia una ragazza
Dopo che aveva pianto
Poi si sciarisce la voce
E ricomincia il canto

Te vojo bene assai
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una cantena ormai
Che sciogliei sangue dint?e vene sai

Vide le luci in mezzo al mare
Pensò alle notti là in America
Ma erano solo le lampare
E la bianca scia di un?elica

Sentì il dolore nella musica
E si alzò dal pianoforte
Ma quando vide uscire la luna da una nuvola
Gli sembro più dolce anche la morte

Guardò negli occhi la ragazza
Quegli occhi verdi come il mare
Poi all?improvisso usci una lacrima
E lui credette di affogare

Te vojo bene assai
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una cantena ormai
Che sciogliei sangue dint?e vene sai

Potenza della lirica
Dove ogni dramma è un falso
Che con un po?di trucco e con la mimica
Puoi diventare un altro

Ma due occhi che ti guardano
Così vicini e veri
Ti fan scordare le parole
Confondono I pensieri

Così diventa tutto piccolo
Anche le notti là in America
Ti volti e vedi la tua vita
Dietro la scia di un?elica

Ma sì, è la vita che finisce
E non ci penso poi tanto
Anzi, si sentiva già felice
E ricominciò il suo canto

Te vojo bene assai
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una cantena ormai
Che sciogliei sangue dint?e vene sai

Te vojo bene assai
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una cantena ormai
Che sciogliei sangue dint?e vene sai

Chris Botti,"I don't care if there's powder on my nose
I don't care if my hairdo is in place
I've lost the very meaning of repose
I never put a mudpack on my face

Oh who'd have thought that I'd walk in a daze
Now I never go to shows at night but just to matinees
Now I see the show
And home I go

Once I laughed when I heard you saying
That I'd be playing solitaire
Uneasy in my easy chair
It never entered my mind

Once you told me I was mistaken
That I'd awaken with the sun
And order orange juice for one
It never entered my mind

You have what I lack myself
And now I even have to scratch my back myself

Once you warned me
That if you scorned me
I'd sing the maiden's prayer again
And wish that you were there again
To get into my hair again
It never entered my mind

You have what I lack myself

And I forget to do
The little ordinary things
That everyone ought to do

I'm living in a kind of daydream
I'm happy as a king
And foolish though it may seem
To me that's everything

The mere idea of you
The longing here for you
You'll never know how slow
The moments go till I'm near to you

I see your face in every flower
Your eyes in stars above
It's just the thought of you

Chris Botti,"Look at yourself
If you had a sense of humor
You would laugh to beat the band
Look at yourself
Do you still believe the rumor
That romance is simply grand?
Since you took it right on the chin
You have lost that bright toothpaste grin
My mental state is all a jumble
I sit around and sadly mumble

Fools rush in, so here I am
Very glad to be unhappy
I can't win, but here I am
More than glad to be unhappy

Unrequited love's a bore
And I've got it pretty bad
But for someone you adore
It's a pleasure to be sad
Like a straying baby lamb
With no mammy and no pappy
I'm so unhappy, but oh, so glad

Chris Botti,"You could say I lost my faith in science and progress
You could say I lost my belief in the holy church
You could say I lost my sense of direction
You could say all of this and worse, but

If I ever lose my faith in you
There'd be nothing left for me to do

Some would say I was a lost man in a lost world
You could say I lost my faith in the people on T.V.
You could say I'd lost my belief in our politicians
They all seemed like game show hosts to me

If I ever lose my faith in you
There'd be nothing left for me to do

I could be lost inside their lies without a trace
But every time I close my eyes, I see your face

I never saw no miracle of science
That didn't go from a blessing to a curse
I never saw no military solution
That didn't always end up as something worse
But let me say this first

I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,

Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?

Chris Botti,"Was a fool with my money
And I lost every dime
And the sun stopped shining
And it rained all time
Oh it did set me back some
But I made it through
But I never get over losing you

Do you know how much mean to me
Should have told you 'cause it's true
I'd get over losing anything
But I'll never get over losing you

When you're young and there's time
You forget the past
You don’t think that you will but you do
But I know that I don’t have time enough
But I'll never get over losing you

I've been cold, I've been hungry
But now for a while, I guess most of my dreams have come true
With that home here around me, no peace do I find

Chris Brian Gussa,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear

Yeah, woo, ooo, woo, ooo, woo, ooo
Listen

Baby, come here and sit down
Let's talk; I got alot to say
So I guess I'll start by sayin' that I love you
But you know this thing ain't been a walk in the park (for us)
I swear it'll only take a minute
You'll understand when I finish, yeah
And I don't want to see you cry
But I don't want to be the one to tell you a lie, so

How do you let go when you
You just don't know what's on
The other side of the door?
When you're walking out, talk about it, and
Everything I tried to remember to say
Just went out my head
So I'm a do the best I can to get you to understand
Cause I know!!

There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move
Cause if I don't, you gonna start hating me
Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl, it's not you, it's me
I, I gotta, gotta figure out what I need, oh
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go

And I know it's hard, but we gotta do it
It's kind of killing me
Cause there's never a right time

And a thousand times I
Found myself asking, ""Why? Why?""
Why am I taking so long to say this?
But trust me, girl, I never
Meant to crush your world
And I never thought I would see the day we'd grow apart
And I wanna know...

How do you let go when you

I saved the last dance for you
How I love to keep you here with me oh baby

I want to be where you are
Ain't nothin' wrong with dancin'
Baby you're so romantic
Baby I can be in your heart
So many things I want to tell you
I think that I should start by saying yo

I don't know your name but excuse me miss
I saw you from across the room

I got to give her game proper
Spit it so she get it
There she is, I got to stop her

I know your trying to leave but excuse me miss
I saved the last dance for you
How I love to keep you here with me oh baby

Now everybody just clap your hands like this(like this)
Just clap your hands like this(whoo like this)
And if your shorty in the house tonight
Just grab her by the hand homie
Make her understand y'all was made to dance like this(like this)
Y'all was made to bounce like this(whoa like this)
Just let her know she was made for you
And you want to do everything she want to, man

Whoo!",Yo (Excuse Me Miss)

They fall out, in and out it again
Tell me how they gonna know about us, telling me and you that we ain't even been around long enough
We can prove em wrong, show em how it's done, I know that we can do it

'Cause it's willin' out (we got that)
Forgiving (we got that)
if it's talkin' bout what we feelin' (we got that)
Just hanging out, keeping it real(we got that)
Me and you know what the deal is

Since we ain't 21, they be trying to say it ain't love
'Cause we can't hit the clubs, they be trying to say we too young
I ain't saying that we trying to be grown, I'm just saying that we old enough to know
We got that young love, young love
We lucky cause we got that young love

This right here is the 16 year old phenome, Chris Breezy
Me, myself, I'm the 23 yr old CEO

Young Carter, I'm harder then them other boys
I ain't even fronting, baby I can take a summer off
I can break a woman off
I can take the stomach off, one of my trucks
Now I'm riding in the goods
Line it on up, guarantee you get served
Lil' Chris, said run it
So I ran and told her
I'm a cash money young'n,
Bird-man junior
Just a president, looking for a minor occurrence

The young boy just turned 16 and I got
6 4's and hot bikes that I rock
Keep 3 or 4 sweeties on my clock
But all that swinging in that bikini just make him dizzy
Slow all the traffic down to a complete stop
'Cause you speaking that slang that I talk
That sassy tempo with that walk,
May be the reason that all this teenies may never see me

Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot (gimme that)

If you take a chance, and let me put them things on you

And um, you can leave your birthday suit on
I'ma leave my boots on
I'ma leave my jewels on
Never know what you want
I'ma leave that tool on
Never know who home
I learned that from a Biggy song
On to a new one
Some like a redbone
Ohh I think she like me, she got me on a ringtone
And I told her, ""Get yours, girl and don't you stop""
Now gimme that funk, that gushy stuff

It seems like everybody thinks they done figured it out 
But every time they fall up in it
They fall out; in and out it again
Tell me, how they gonna know about us? 
Telling me and you that we ain't even been around long enough
We can prove 'em wrong, show 'em how it's done
I know that we can do it

'Cause it's wil'n out (we got that)
Forgiving (we got that)
If it's talkin' 'bout what we feelin' (we got that)
Just hanging out, keeping it real (we got that)
Me and you know what the deal is

Since we ain't twenty-one, they be trying to say it ain't love
'Cause we can't hit the clubs, they be trying to say we too young
I ain't saying that we trying to be grown
I'm just saying that we old enough to know
We got that young love, young love
We lucky 'cause we got that young love

It's crazy how all our friends say that we gone
They still tryin' to figure us out, babe
'Cause we always together, and we don't gotta front
We ain't pretend, girl
And you know a couple of them gone hate
Talk behind your back, smile up in ya face

We can hit a show, kick it on the block
Everywhere we go, we know that we got that young love, young love, young love

You know
Sometimes you don't realize what you've done
Until you've seen the damage
And now I look at the damage
(Look at the damage)

Three A.M. when my phone ring, begging me to come by
I was right around the corner
I know I could've said no, but I ain't stop
Told me to Come in, the door is unlock for ya
My intuition
I should
Have listened to it
My girl
Yo, she'd be pissed if she knew
About this visit
She had her tank top on, I took her tank top off
I should've stopped
Stop!
But she ain't let me, kissed me soft and gently
She tempt me
Right then I stopped thinking consequences
Guess I must've lost my mind for a minute

There's no better love
Girl, I love you
With her that was lust
Yeah
Shouldn't have been
I know I messed up
Yeah

Started this whole thing

Damage that I've caused you (that I've caused you)
I know I broke your heart
Cause I did you wrong
Now look at the damage
Look at the damage that I've caused

The dumbest decision that I made that I ain't proud of
A few hours that meant absolutely nothing cost me your love
I gotta live with regret
Deserve to get what you get
Now you won't listen to nothing that I'm saying
I rode past your house for hours
Just to feel close to ya
No car, no gift, no flowers
Could get me back with you
Your kiss, your touch
Girl, you know I miss it
But you got my heart
Inside of a prison


There's no better love
Girl, I love you
With her that was lust

The big mouth bass
On the line
It's time for me to retrieve her
And go git her like a wild receiver
But we don't play no ball
See when we come through
We baby girl gon' BB don't play at all

On the real we need to nip this in the bud
Cause we kept it real with everyone
So tell me why they hatin' (everybody's hatin')
It feels like they just waitin' (for us to grow apart)
It's just hard for me to do
But baby if I'm your man
I guess I gotta be your man
These men just gotta understand
Little girl, with curves and hips, luscious lips
Girl I can't front now
I'm nervous

I'm like hold up
Wait, wait a minute

I ain't tryna' put no pimpin' in it

Can I talk to her
Hold up
Can I take her out
Hold up , uh

Now a days is so crazy
Out here
You'd wanna be cuttin' me
If your daughter struts with me
Lucky me, and you'd be lucky too
No entourage, no crew
Just me ridin' with my boo
I got her
But don't think I'm replacin' you

Girl know you know what I do
And I know you made your mind up
It'll take days and days, and decades to find another
Dude that's gonna walk in my shoes
And girl keep it one with you
As long if you do the usual

[Verse 1]
I remember Saturday mornin's
Me wakin' up to momma in the kitchen cookin' to Sam Cook and
I was just a young dude, watchin' mornin' cartoons, waitin' for momma to braid my hair
I used to hate to get it done, cause she'd braid it too tight
My momma always gave a style she knew I would like, and then
I would go outside and play, she'd sit on the front porch
While me and Rob played ball

[Bridge]
Momma always did little things like that
Momma always will know I love her for that
For all the things that you used to do...
Momma I dedicate this one to you

That Ima sing this one for you, so let me sing this one for you
From every tour, every show
You're my lucky charm, go wherever I go
Momma Ima sing this one to you, momma let me sing this one to you

[Verse 2]
She's like the mother of Tappahannock, VA
Everybody knew miss Joyce, where we stayed
All heads said she was cool, nothing' that she wouldn't do
But about CB, she was know to act a fool (whoawhoa)
With the little money that she made
She took the bed and made it all okay
Night at the daycare, when we had to stay there
Always held it down, so I gotta thank you now

[Bridge]
Momma always did little things like that (oh)
Momma always will know (aye) I love her for that

Wanna put in some time 'cause you know what they're already about

I'm the one that lost the view
Everybody says we're through
I hope you haven't said it too

So where
Do we go from here
With all this fear in our eyes'
And where
Can love take us now
We've been so far down'
We can still touch the sky

If we crawl
Till we can walk again
Then we'll run
Until we're strong enough to jump
Then we'll fly
Until there is no wind
So lets crawl, crawl, crawl
Back to love, yeah
Back to love, yeah

Why did I change the pace
Hearts were never meant to race
Always felt the need for space
But now I can't reach your face (your face)
So where
Are you standing now
Are you in the crowd of my faults
Love, can you see my hand'
I need one more chance
We can still have it all

Chris Brown,"Sometimes I don't wanna wake up alone
But sometimes I wanna wake up and be on my own

But at the same time I don't wanna let people down

Can you imagine, the weight of a world
Placed on your shoulders, trapped in this world
And no-one can reach you, oh oh oh oh
So no-one can help you, now

It's getting heavy I think I'm bout ready to break down
I'm standing up, but I'm fallin' down

Someone pick me up, cause I'm fallin' down

Down, down, down, down
I'm fallin' down, down, down, down,

Sorry I bust the windows out your car
I might of cheated in the beginning
I was wrong for writing ""Disturbia""
But I meant it in ""Forever"",

And I can't let you go

Said you thought you find the right man

Chris Brown,"All the bullshit's for the birds
You ain't nothin' but a vulture
Always hopin' for the worst
Waiting for me to fuck up
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
Who knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean
When I tell her keep it drama free

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (chu-chuckin' up the deuces)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I told you that I'm leaving (deuces)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I know you mad but so what?
I wish you best of luck
And now I'm 'bout to throw them deuces up

I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her (deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryin' to make it work
You made me wanna say bye bye,
say bye bye, say bye bye to her
You made me wanna say bye bye,
say bye bye, say bye bye to her

Uh, use to be valentines
Together all the time
Thought it was true love, but you know women lie
It's like I sent my love with a text two times
Call 'cause I care but I ain't gettin' no reply
Tryna see eye to eye but it's like we both blind
Fuck it lets hit the club, I rarely sip but pour me some

'Cause when it's all said and done,
I ain't gon' be the one that she can always run to
I hate liars, fuck love I'm tired of tryin'
My heart big but it beat quiet
how never feel like we vibin'
'Cause every time we alone it's a awkward silence

So leave your keys on the kitchen counter
And gimme back that ruby ring with the big diamond
Shit is over, what you trippin' for?
I don't wanna have to let you go
But baby I think it's better if I let you know

I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her (deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryin' to make it work
You made me wanna say bye bye,
say bye bye, say bye bye to her
You made me wanna say bye bye,
say bye bye, say bye bye to her

Look, my shorty always on some bullshit like Chicago
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow
Deuces, we ain't got no future in tomorrow
I'm a dick, so it shouldn't be that hard to swallow
The other chick I'm with never complainin'
She make wanna leave the one I'm with Usher Raymond

Probably didn't register, don't trip, later on it will
Shorty full of drama like gangsta grizzles
I finally noticed it, it finally hit me
Like Tina did Ike in the limo, it finally hit me
I got a new chick, and she ain't you
She Paula Patton thick she give me deja Vu

And all that attitude, I don't care about it
But all that shit I do for her, you gon hear bout it
Breezy rep two up, two down
But I'm just puttin' two up, chuckin' up the deuce now

I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her (deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryin' to make it work
You made me wanna say bye bye,
say bye bye, say bye bye to her
You made me wanna say bye bye,
say bye bye, say bye bye to her

If I had the minutes, I would turn 'em into hours
And make love to your mind and not your body instead

That didn't know what I had until I lost you
And every single moment that you're not here
You said the evident to me that everything just seems so clear

When you throw it back babe
Girl it might be too much
Babe if you keep doing that

Everything that I ever wanted
Never thought of what I might need, need, need
Ain't it funny, how I spend my whole life running
Reaching for the sky high and coming down with nothing

Feels like I'm four years old all over again
Because I'm just running fast and should be walking
Saying when I grow up you gon' see
I'm gon' be comfortable and happy

I guess I was faking cause look at all the money I'm making
Still nothing can compare to the thought of love
But it's taking too much time to see that I'm wasting
Reaching for the sky high and coming down with nothing

It feels like I'm four years old all over again
'Cause I just keep running fast and should be walking
Saying when I grow up you gon' see
I'm gon' be comfortable and happy

Change your body, need a visor
Car too big, but f*** it, don't need a driver
All me want is a girl who'll be a rider
Can't believe she pull it, pull it
N**** gun, gun down

She want me to hold her, hold her down
Sorry boo boo, you gets no love, no love now
Must be coo-coo, got me f***ed up, f***ed up, wow
You know a n**** ain't goin' hold ya, hold ya down

I'm a mirage (f*** I look like?)
I'm a mirage (what the f*** I look like?)
It's all in your mind, your mind (f*** I look like?)
Open your eyes, you're blind (what the f*** I look like?)

Your mind should apologize to ya
Keep on tellin' all of those crazy lies to ya
You believe 'em, I don't wanna accept the truth
Who the f*** you kiddin', kiddin', what's the use?

Sad to see you playing the fool
You don't know half the s*** that a n**** been through
I guess you got your reward, reward for it
You actin' like you don't need me, baby

But she want me to hold her, hold her down (got me f***ed up baby)
Sorry boo boo, you gets no love, no love now
Must be coo-coo, got me f***ed up, f***ed up, wow
You know a n**** ain't goin' hold ya, hold ya down
Excuse my French but

I'm a mirage (f*** I look like?)
I'm a mirage (what the f*** I look like?)
It's all in your mind, your mind (f*** I look like?)
Open your eyes, you're blind (what the f*** I look like?)

You lookin' for love, and I'm the one you imagine
With athlete money from just rappin'
My body wrapped in some Valentino, Laurel Piano fashion
Sex with passion, romancin', laughin'
Happiness, action, restaurants, relaxin'
They got some good sushi in Aspen, that good p**** I'm smashin'
I call you massaheesa, yeah I'm your Visa
American Express, I must confess
I'm tryna go beyond love, and this is hard to translate
Love is good, but to me, good is just the enemy of great
You wanna make it to the top, but you don't got what it take
To be a model, actress, singer, stripper
Want me to help you to become a star, you was my sister
You was my soldier, damn, I used to miss ya
I used to love ya, I think to hold ya
You didn't know me, it was only just a mirage

I'm a mirage (f*** I look like?)
I'm a mirage (what the f*** I look like?)
It's all in your mind, your mind (f*** I look like?)
Open your eyes, you're blind (what the f*** I look like?)",Mirage
Chris Brown,"I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take!

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know I may end up failing too
But I know you were just like me with someone disappointed in you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Chris Brown,"I need your touch, but your hands are locked away
I hear your voice, you’ve got nothing left to say
I’ll take this start of my heart
I’ll take this bullet, I’ll take it for love

So if the lights in the sky come crashing down
I still can find your love even in the crowd

Remember my name, will you remember my name

I need my kiss, but your lips are far away
So I have no choice, so I guess I’ll have to stay and love away
And I’ma take this stop from my heart,
Bang bang, I take this bullet, bang bang I’ll take it for love
Bang bang, I’ll take it for love,
Bang bang, I’ll take it for us

Chris Brown,"If you leave this time I feel that you'll be gone for good, so
And I hold on like leaves and fall to what is left
Said her father left her young and
He said he'll be back with that same
Song that you just said you'll stay forever with

It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
I feel like you're the only reason for it
All the things you do
All the things you do
All the things you do
All the things you do
All the things you do
All the things you do
It's safe to say you're the only reason for it

I've been bleeding in your silence
I feel safer in your violence
I hold on like leaves and fall to what is left
Before I sleep I talk to God
He must be mad with me, it's coming
I'm confused who I'll spend my forever with, oh

It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
I feel like you're the only reason for it
All the things you do
All the things you do
All the things you do
All the things you do
All the things you do
All the things you do

So the iceberg never broke
And I poked at it and I poked at it and I poked at it
And I poke and I poke and I poked at it
But it stayed stagnant then I poked at it some more, some more
And in my notepad, man I wrote and I wrote
If I don't have it, if I don't grab it
If it don't chip then a toe tag is, one last
I'mma hope, I'mma hope so the iceberg don't float
If I do manage to do damage to you dammit
It'd be grand, it's ten grammies or my granite still standing
With a note, a note that read ""granted, don't you panic""
When you make mistakes the most, the most
One day it'll make you grow, you grow
When you outlandish and you lose manners
To God you shall consult, consult
When the bright cameras are still cramming
In your face and it provoke, provoke
You to act manic, just stay planted
'Cause you reapin' what you sowed
Keep positivity in your heart and
Keep a noose from 'round your throat and
When you get mad and when you poke at it
When you poke it at just know, man
The iceberg is a reflection of you when you re-new your vision
Just think if it had sunk Titanic, what the fuck would you do to a critic, my nigga?
Yeah, yeah, tell me, when doves cry do you hear 'em love? (Do you hear 'em love)
Do you hear 'em?
And if my ship go down tell me who will abort?
And they won't let me live even when we mustard the gift
When it gon' rejoice and forgive, tell me how I stay positive
When they never see good in me
Even though I got hood in me
Don't mean he won't redeem me, Lord

It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
I feel like you're the only reason for it

Chris Brown,"Yeah

I love women and power
We used to sit and talk for hours
On the balcony, my condo play your favorite, shawty
No love lost, just the perfect soulmate, that's all
It's my fault, caught in a rupture
Should've been you I was touchin', I knew it wasn't
My ego, I was buzzin' but not how you wanted
Too busy tryna flaunt it, like I just bought it
You know them bitches 'round you can't hold water
This s'posed to be our moment
These pills set it, I'm feelin' better
Called you to tell you I love you
But you too busy with some other shit, I'm guessin'
No texts, no proof, no voice messages
How we become enemies so effortless?
Or was I blind when you was naked?
Or high when you was level
Know time is of the essence
No lie, I live and regret it
Decisions I made, embedded in my mind
Hate to admit it
But I gotta say it one time

Should've treated you right
But every night I was livin' life in the fast lane
I should've put my focus on you
In the club every night
I just get it wrong when you do right
And I keep just fillin' your head with the lies, oh baby
This shit comes with a price
A nigga should've loved you better
Oh (couldn't get you right)
A nigga should've loved you better
Now you're out of sight (oh baby) still on my mind
A nigga should've loved you better
Should've took the time, to get you all the time
Now you're out of sight, (oh baby) still on my mind
A nigga should've loved you

What happened to me, babe?
This ain't who you fell in love with
You say you need space
Don't do this
Just look at me
One more time
I know I fucked up but I'm tryin' to please you
I'ma give you all
And your heartache and pain's gonna stop
Baby right here
Don't walk away
There is no one left to call
Don't wanna be alone when you disappear
I know I hurt you more than three times
Now you need me time
Fuck I'm s'posed to do in the meantime?
Then she, then she told me ""figure it out""

Should've treated you right
But every night I was livin' life in the fast lane
I should've put my focus on you

My chain too bright, no Thomas Edison
When I pull it out, bitch nervous
Better ride this wave bitch, surf it
Girl, you better keep them legs open
The only thing you close is these curtains
And she only got time for a nigga if I take her out to eat
A nigga really gotta motivate
Man, that's too much work for the pussy
I don't work for the pussy, nigga really don't communicate
I'd rather lick it like a dinner plate
I'd rather keep my money in a safe
Bitch, I ain't got time to play
I need it now, not a minute late

Girl you know we got the time
Got that pussy on my mind
Later on, what are we doing?
I know you're ready, show that ass
Girl you looking so bad, getting horny watching you do it
Girl I wanna kiss it, while you kissin your' girlfriends
I wanna see a whole lot of licking, that's a memory
(Yeah, bet I make that pussy remember me)

Drive your head to a king, nigga
Dream's house, my dream's bigger
Got a deck of cards if my heart switch up
Ace of spades, her eyes lit up
Diamonds glitter in my car, thriller
She pray for me, that's God willing
I'm hard to break my boss prison
Her new name, Ass-Zilla
She love a nigga and that pussy tight
Come thru, fuck you all night
Some foreplay, that's all right
But she rather do number 69
High notes, it's prime time
On a couch, hit it from behind
Hit you with that long stroke
Now she fiendin' for that good dope, yeah
That's my bae, she cook and clean and I got it made
Handcuff like she a slave, touch ya, let ya tongue taste
So high, no ceiling space
Numb to it, can't feel her face
Yeah, she numb to it, can't feel her face

Girl you know we got the time
Got that pussy on my mind
Later on, what are we doing?
I know you're ready, show that ass

Girl I wanna kiss it, while you kissin' your girlfriends
I wanna see a whole lot of licking, that's a memory
(Yeah, bet I make that pussy remember me)

Blowing up my line on the cellular
She wanna lock a nigga down, on the regular
Talking crazy to me like she own the dick
But I don't trust her as far as I can throw the bitch
Momma told me to find a keeper
But I switch like designer sneakers
A girl with the finest features
Every nigga wanna talk to her
But I got her first, finders keepers
Violins in the back, is my theme music
Her ass on my mind, I dream booty
Any nigga tryna fuck my bitch
Then its off with his head, how kings do it
My rings ruby
Red bandana, I stay woopin'
Got too many cribs, I stay movin'
Three Lambos, I stay coupin'
Yeah, but you don't hear me though
Virginia to the Westside
My car foreign, the girl sit on the left side
Smokin' weed on the plane, that's the best high
She gotta sign the waiver 'fore I let her fly
Helipads on the boat
Chilling in the South of France, Saint-Tropez, Nice, Monaco
But nothing compare to what's in my pants
Girl, stop playing!

Girl you know we got the time
Got that pussy on my mind
Later on, what are we doing?
I know you're ready, show that ass

And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.

I got nowhere to go
And even if I did, I'd probably get there real slow

For turning it upside down
For tearing my world in two

Chris Cacavas,"Her face was white as meerschaum 
Washed up by the sea
Her hair was as yellow 
As a field of blowing wheat
Her name I don't remember too well 
Pale blonde hell

She reminded me of someone 
I knew way back when
She reminded me of the one 
Who taught me how to sin
She was like an angel who just fell 
Pale blonde hell

It is not her fault 
That she was the way she was
It is not my fault 
My heart does the things it does
Now I'm at the bottom of this well 
Pale blonde hell

Yeah my baby left me 
And I have a tale to tell
So I'll crawl down lonely street

To the place where my lover dwells

Every regret and piece of ass you hit
You rather sorry Bag of Bones

Look at you now
The sun it's goin' down
Watch as you fall
Now you're all just a bag of bones

Hunched on top with the fruits of you
A wooden nickel for your pain
Every step by the book
Still a company crook
A worthless trip down memory lane

Seems we all have been crossed, test of time
It's not really fair, the leader he lies

Faces of truth, his face is a mess
Faces of love and faces of hale
Faces of death, I can't wait!

Every move that we're making, puppet minds
It really isn't fair, the kingdom it dies, it dies!

Is the love between a woman and a man

Well, I grew up working like my daddy did
Broke the land with my hands and the money rolled in
But it wasn't enough and I did not understand
You see, the only thing that matters money can't buy
And when it gets down the bottom line
It's the love you find between a woman and a man

Standing tall on the backyard shed
Lookin' cool in my Superman cape

I told the neighborhood girls,
said ""Hey y'all, watch this!""

My reward, one big kiss

When Daddy asked me why I did it
I made him laugh out loud
When I told him 'cause the chicks dig it

Chris Cagle,"C'mon baby, won't you take my hand
I wanna walk with you a while, and tell you what's been on my mind
I know this life can get crazy sometimes
And we forget about the most important things
I know I've been guilty of gettin' caught up
In the rush of today and the worries of tomorrow
But that ain't the point of my existence
No, that's not why I'm breathin'

[Chorus]
Oh I was made for you
For lovin' you baby
Oh, I was made for you
For lovin' you, lovin' you

Sun and rain and wind and sand
Somehow came together to make this world we're livin' on
Flesh and bone, I'm only human
But I know God had a plan for me
And it took me a while to figure it all out
I had to go down some roads I should've never gone down
But you were all the answers
To every question I was askin'

[Chorus]

Like the glass that holds the wine
The sunset in the western skies
Like the love there in your eyes

Chris Cagle,"In a crowd, in the dark
I would walk straight to your heart
Without any hesitation
Every turn, every town
Every highway I go down
Baby, you're my destination
And even if nowhere was where every road lead me to

Chorus:
I'd find you 
I'd find you 
In the day or the night, in the black or the white
In the red of a rose of the depths of the ocean blue
I'd find you

Even if you and I 
Never met, still I know I'd find 
You among the millions 
It's beyond my control
Like a magnet pullin' my soul
Across the great division
And even if I lost my way in this world I walk through

(Repeat Chorus)

All my life I need you next to me
‘Cause in your eyes I see my destiny
And I'd find you
Yeah I'd find you
In the face of a child, in the warmth of a smile
On the first day of spring when the flowers grow wild
Every song ever sung about bein' in love
Every kiss, every hug, every touch
Anytime, anyplace, in the whole human race
In the sweet memories and the ones yet to be
In the wrong and the right and the beauty that lies in the truth
I'd find you
Yeah I'd find you",I'd Find You
Chris Cagle,"I'm exausted
Tryin' to catch my breath the morning after
Pour my coffee
With Shakin' hands and my world in disarray
Lost in the softness and strength that's in her hands
I see her face and I can barely stand
But oh, the sweet redemption every time she mentions
That she wants me, oh, that she needs me, oh

(Chorus:)
Maria
Your kisses knock me over
Make me drunk and then leave me sober
They let me know that I'm a man
Maria
Your touch, it almost kills me
Then it turns around and heals me
I get lost and found again
In the arms of a woman that a mother gave the name Maria
Tender power
The gift she gives me gets me through the day
Midnight hour
I reach across the bed where she lay
Then I look up and see the moon dance on her skin
My heart starts poundin' once again
It's a sweet intoxication, a powerful frustration
How I want her, oh how I need her

When you hear our favorite song
Miss me baby
And when you start to sing along
Think about all the times that danced in light to it all night long
Oh, then miss me baby

You want me honey
Like you did the night you told me that you loved me
You couldn't wait anymore
Left the keys in the door, took my hand, pulled my down on the kitchen floor
Yeah we were that crazy

Cause when he's holding you
Know that it's killing me
Let my memory be the reason, girl, that you can't sleep

That I've touched your heart so deep, girl, you can't shake me

Chris Cagle,"I remember the summer I turned sixteen,
And that old jalopy Daddy gave to me,
It had holes in the floor and just a 305
But I didn't care 'cause I could finally drive.
There wasn't much to do in my home town,
So every weekend night, we would all go down

There were freaks and hippies in my high school;
Football players all tryin' to be cool.
And everybody scramblin' to hide their beer'
When the cops drove by till the coast was clear.

Kids fallin' in and out of love,
On the hoods of Chevys, in the beds of trucks
We were stumblin' our way through life 'til our senior year,
But man we sure did learn a lot in that Wal-Mart parking lot.

She had long blonde hair and sea-green eyes;
The most beautiful thing I'd ever seen in my life.
But I was young and dumb and didn't have a line,

And all I could say was can i call 'ya sometime?
She just said no and walked away,
But she just said no and walked away,
And that was the first time I felt my heart break.

There were freaks and hippies in my high school;
Football players all tryin' to be cool.
And everybody scramblin' to hide their beer'
When the cops drove by till the coast was clear.

Yeah, we all did alot of livin'.
It was small-town teenage heaven.

There were freaks and hippies in my high school;
Football players all tryin' to be cool.
And everybody scramblin' to hide their beer'
When the cops drove by till the coast was clear.

Well, I had my first kiss, my first love,
Got my ass kicked but I got back up.
Lost my way, found it again,
Had one long buzz and a dozen best friends

In that Wal-Mart parking lot.
In that Wal-Mart parking lot.",Wal-Mart Parking Lot
Chris Cagle,"It's all the same, only the names are changed
Everyday it seems we're wasting away
Another place where the faces are so cold

Cause I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted dead or alive
Wanted
Dead or alive

Sometimes I sleep, sometimes it's not for days
The people I meet always go their separate ways
Sometimes you tell the day
By the bottle that you drink
And times when you're alone all you do is think

[Chorus]

I walk these streets, a loaded six string on my back
I play for keeps, 'cause I might not make it back

From what I hear, the beer is cheap down in Mexico

Before you go giving my job away
You might want to think about it, yeah

No matter how hard I try to forget
I said a lot of hateful things that I didn't mean 
And have a lifetime left of regret

I admit I was wrong all along now you're gone with all that I'd been living for
I don't wanna live without you, anymore

For a couple of nights I was fine
I was high off the wine and the lights and my new found freedom, that I thought I needed

But that cold lonely room that I headed home to, it felt like a tomb
I just stared at the ceiling, what an empty feeling
And baby I, apologize, and tell me its not too late

Chris Cagle,"I heard the door slam, and I couldn't tell
Was it just the wind, or was she mad again? (aww hell)
She's gettin' in her car. I hollar ""Baby, is there something wrong?""
Thought I heard her say something sounding like ""I'm gone"".
But these days gone can mean so many things.

There's gone for good, and there's good and gone
And there's gone with the long before it
I wish she'd been just a little more clear.
Well, there's gone for the day and gone for the night
And gone for the rest of your dod' gone life.
Is it a whiskey night, or just a couple beers?
I mean what kinda' gone are we talkin' 'bout here?

Well, it's gettin' dark out, she ain't back yet
Ain't called home, turned off the phone. (aww man)
Ha, this might not be good. I woulda' stopped her when she went to leave
But it didn't call 'cause I didn't really think what I'm thinkin' now.
I'm still not sure what gone is all about.

There's gone for good, and there's good and gone
And there's gone with the long before it

Well, there's gone for the day and gone for the night
And gone for the rest of your dod' gone life.
Is it a whiskey night, or just a couple beers?
I mean what kinda' gone are we talkin' 'bout here?

Is it the kinda' gone where she's at her moms?
Coolin' down, she'll come around
Or the kind that says you had your chance
And she ain't comin' back.

There's gone for good, and there's good and gone
And there's gone with the long before it

You treated me so kind,
I'm about to lose my mind.
You made me so very happy,
I'm so glad you came into my life.

The others were untrue,
But when it came to lovin' you,
I'd spend my whole life with you.
'Cause you came and you took control,
You touched my very soul.
You always showed me that
Loving you was where it's at.
You made me so very happy,
I'm so glad you came into my life.

I love you so much, it seems
That you're even in my dreams.
I hear you calling me.
I'm so in love with you,
All I ever want to do is
Thank you, baby.

You made me so very happy,
I'm so glad you came into my life.
You made me so very happy,
I'm so glad you came into my life.

Like a shining star
You brighten my whole world
It brings me joy being your girl

'Cause everything's good about you
I couldn't live without you
You're so sweet, you're so fine
I'm so thankful that you're mine

Full of clover
Bustin' out all over
You're the summer in the park
You're the candle in the dark
And I love you, so true
Yes, I do

You're the love of my life
You're a pure delight
The short time I've been with you
You must've come from heaven above

You're the sunshine after the storm
When I'm cold you make me warm
And I love you, so true

And things will be alright
Together just you and me
Just living in pure ecstacy

You're leaving me behind

Chris Clark,"What happened to the world we knew,
when we would dream and scheme and while the time away,
I have a dream, so did you.
Life was warms, love was true,
Two kids who followed all the rules, yester-fools, 
and now, now it seems those yester-dreams were just a cruel 
and foolish game we used to play,
yester-me, yester-you, yester-day.
 
Where did it go, that yester-glow
When we could feel the wheel of life turn our way.
Yester-me, yester-you, yester-day.
When I recall what we had,
I feel lost, I feel sad.
With nothing but the mem'ry of yester-love
and now now it seems those yester-dreams were just a cruel 
and foolish game we used to play,
yester-me, yester-you, yester-day.

Gave me Dinah; 
I'm the proudest one 
Beneath the Dixie sun. 

News is spreadin' 
'Bout our weddin'; 
I hear church bells ringin', 
Here's the song my heart keeps singin': 

Dinah, 
Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her! 

Dinah, 
With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

Chris Cobb,"I've got every reason on earth to be mad
'Cause I just lost the only girl I had
If I could get my way
I'd get myself locked up today
But I can't, so I'll cry instead

I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger that my feet
I can't talk to people that I meet
If I could see you now
I'd try to make you sad somehow
But I can't, so I'll cry instead

Don't want to cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away
But I'll come back again someday

And when you do you'd better hide all the girls
I'm gonna break their hearts all round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break them in two
And show you what your lovin' man can do
Until then I'll cry instead",I'll Cry Instead

Chris Coco,"Every morning on every news flash
I hear the sorrow of the world
It seems like everybody's lost and
Scared trying to make sense of it all
And as I travel to and fro, so many faces pass me by
I see lonely hearts living lonely lives just biding their time
And while we call ourselves civilized, many people living empty lives
As they drone their way through day and night

[Chorus:]

I pray for our world, I pray for every child
I pray for our world to be filled with smiles
Like the colors of a rainbow and not just black and white
I pray for our world to be filled with light
I pray for all of us, to choose the path that's right
To believe in Allah every day of our lives 

In the evening on the TV news, I see images of war
I see brother killing brother with no consequence at all
And while those who claim to be leaders, sell us tales of deceit
But Allah alone know in their hearts what they reveal and conceal
And while we call ourselves civilized
We go on killing human lives
Too caught up in our own web of lies

[Chorus:]

Every mother, every father, every daughter, every son
Don't you see, that the answer lies only with the one",Sunday Morning
Chris Colangelo,"Ask me how do I feel,
Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

From the moment we kissed goodnight,
That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Or if I were a season,
I'd surely be Spring,
Yes, and if I were a bell,
Say, if I were a bell,
If I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".",If I Were a Bell

The music playing?
How do you make it last
How do keep
The song from fading
Too fast

How do you lose yourself
To someone
And never lose your way
How do you not run
Out of new things
To say

And since you know
We're always changing
How can it be the same
And tell me how
Year after year
You're sure your heart
Will fall apart
Each time
You hear her name

I know the way
I feel for you
Is now or never
The more
I love the more
There I'm afraid
That in yours eyes
I may not see forever

The best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends
If we can try with every day
To make it better as it goes
With any luck than I suppose
