Duke Ellington,"How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
Yes, and how many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
Before they're forever banned?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

How many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
That too many people have died?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

How many years can a mountain exist
Before it's washed to the sea?
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
Pretending he just doesn't see?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind",Blowin' in the Wind
Duke Ellington,"Call me irresponsible, call me unreliable
Throw in undependable too
Do my foolish alibis bore you?
Well, I'm not too clever; I just adore you

Call me unpredictable, tell me I'm impractical
Rainbows I'm inclined to pursue
Call me irresponsible; yes, I'm unreliable
But it's undeniably true: I'm irresponsibly mad for you",Call Me Irresponsible
Duke Ellington,"When we played our charade
We were like children posing
Playing at games, acting out names
Guessing the parts we played

Oh, what a hit we made
We came on next to closing
Best on the bill, lovers until
Love left the masquerade

Fate seemed to pull the strings
I turned and you were gone
While from the darkened wings
That music box played on

Sad little serenade
Song of my heart's composing
I hear it still; I always will
Best on the bill, charade",Charade
Duke Ellington,"Danke schoen, darling, Danke schoen,
Thank you for all the joy and pain.
Picture shows, second balcony was the place we'd meet,
Second seat, go Dutch treat, you were sweet.

Danke schoen, darling, danke schoen,
Thank you for funny cards from Spain.
I recall Central Park in fall how you tore you dress,
What a mess, I confess that's not all.

Danke schoen, darling danke schoen,
Thank you for walks down Lover's Lane.
I can see hearts carved on a tree
Letters intertwined for all time.
Yours and mine, that was fine.

Danke schoen, darling danke schoen,
Thank you for seeing me again.
Tho' we go on our sep'rate ways
Still the mem'ry stays for always.",Danke Schoen
Duke Ellington,"The days of wine and roses laugh and run away like a child at play
Through a meadowland toward a closing door
A door marked ""nevermore"" that wasn't there before

The lonely night discloses just a passing breeze filled with memories
Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you

(The lonely night discloses) just a passing breeze filled with memories
Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you",Days of Wine and Roses
Duke Ellington,"Oh, the good life, full of fun
Seems to be the ideal
Yes, the good life lets you hide 
All the sadness you feel

You won't really fall in love
For you can't take the chance
So be honest with yourself
Don't try to fake romance

It's the good life 
To be free and explore the unknown
Like the heartaches 
When you learn you must face them alone

Please, remember, I still love you
And in case you don't know
Well, just wake up
Kiss the good life ""hello""",The Good Life
Duke Ellington,"I left my heart in San Francisco.
High on a hill it calls to me
to be where little cable cars 
climb halfway to the stars!
The morning fog may chill the air,
I don't care! 
My love waits there in San Francisco,
above the blue and windy sea.
When I come home to you, San Francisco,
your golden sun will shine for me!

Duke Ellington,"Moon River, wider than a mile
I'm crossin' you in style someday
Old dream maker, you heart-breaker

Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' your way
Two drifters off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see

We're after the same rainbow's end
Waitin' 'round the bend
My huckleberry friend, Moon River, and me",Moon River
Duke Ellington,"Oh, you can kiss me on a Monday
A Monday, a Monday is very, very good
Or you can kiss me on a Tuesday
A Tuesday, a Tuesday, in fact I wish you would
Or you can kiss me on a Wednesday
A Thursday, a Friday and Saturday is best
But never, never on a Sunday
A Sunday, a Sunday, 'cause that's my day of rest
 
Most any day you can be my guest
Any day you say, but my day of rest
Just name the day that you like the best
Only stay away on my day of rest
 
Oh, you can kiss me on a cool day, a hot day
A wet day, which everyone you choose
Or try to kiss me on a gray day, a May day
A pay day, and see if I refuse
And if you make it on a bleak day
A freak day, a week day, why you can be my guest
But never, never on a Sunday",Never on a Sunday
Duke Ellington,"People, people who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world

We're children needing other children
And yet letting our grown-up pride
Hide all the need inside
Acting more like children than children

Lovers are very special people
They're the luckiest people in the world

With one person, one very special person
A feeling deep in your soul
Says you were half, now you're whole
No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person who needs people

People, people who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world

No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person who needs people

Duke Ellington,"I want some red roses for a blue lady
Mister florist, take my order, please
We had a silly quarrel the other day
Hope these pretty flowers chase her blues away

Wrap up some red roses for a blue lady
Send them to the sweetest gal in town
And if they do the trick, I'll hurry to pick
Your best white orchid for her wedding gown",Red Roses for a Blue Lady
Duke Ellington,"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around",The Second Time Around
Duke Ellington,"We're clearly soldiers in petticoats
And dauntless crusaders for woman's votes
Though we adore men individually
We agree that as a group they're rather stupid!

Cast off the shackles of yesterday!
Shoulder to shoulder into the fray!
Our daughters' daughters will adore us
And they'll sign in grateful chorus
""Well done, Sister Suffragette!""

From Kensington to Billingsgate 
One hears the restless cries!
From ev'ry corner of the land:
""Womankind, arise!""
Political equality and equal rights with men!
Take heart! For Missus Pankhurst has been clapped in irons again!

No more the meek and mild subservients we!
We're fighting for our rights, militantly!
Never you fear!

So, cast off the shackles of yesterday!
Shoulder to shoulder into the fray!
Our daughters' daughters will adore us
And they'll sign in grateful chorus
""Well done! Well done! 
Well done Sister Suffragette!""",Sister Suffragette
Duke Ellington,"I belong to you and I know I show it
You belong to me, baby; you'd better know it
Give me all your love, sugar, spice, and sweet honey
Don't you ever quit

Not for love or money
I'd do most anything just to amuse you
But there's nothing that I wouldn't do
Thought that I would never lose you
When I play the game, I can't afford to blow it
'Cause I play for keeps; you'd better know it

Yes, I'd do most anything just to amuse you

Duke Ellington,"Everything is set, skies are blue,
Can't believe it yet, but it's true, 
I'll give you just one guess, 
My sweet Lorraine said ""yes""
Waiting for the time, soon to be, 
When the bells will chime merrily,
 
(I'm so happy,) when it's raining I don't miss the sun, 
For it's in my sweeties smile,
Just think that I'm the lucky one 
Who will lend her down the aisle
Each night I pray 
That nobody steals her heart away, 
Just can't wait until that happy day,
When I marry sweet Lorraine
 
Everything is set, skies are blue,
Can't believe it yet, but it's true, 
I'll give you just one guess, 
My sweet Lorraine said ""yes""

That nobody steals her heart away, 
Just can't wait until that happy day,
When I marry sweet Lorraine",Sweet Lorraine
Duke Ellington,"So you're leaving 
In the morning 
On the early train 
I could say everything's all right 
I could pretend and say goodbye 

Got your ticket 
Got your suitcase 
Got your leaving smile 

I could say that's the way it goes 
I could pretend and you won't know 
That I was lying 
'Cause I can't stop loving you 
I can't stop loving you 
No, I can't stop loving you 

Though I try 
Took a taxi 
To the station 
Not a word was said 
I saw you walk across the road 
Maybe the last time, I don't know 

Feeling humble 
I heard a rumble 
On the railway track 
And when I hear the whistle blow 
I walk away and you don't know 

That I was lying 
'Cause I can't stop loving you 
No, I can't stop loving you 
I can't stop loving you 
Though I try 

'Cause I can't stop loving you 
I can't stop loving you 
No, I can't stop loving you 
Though I try",I Can't Stop Loving You

I'll be with you

In your caress there is happiness
And love in view
If dreams come true",If Dreams Come True
Duke Ellington,"Love it seems I just can't find
Love it seems I just can't find
Seems that I'm the one love
The one love left behind
I've searched it just won't come my way
I've searched it just won't come my way
It's love that I want now
So what more can I say
Women seem to pass me by
Women seem to pass me by
If I could find the reason
I'd know the answer why
Love it seems I just can't find
Love it seems I just can't find
Seems that I'm the one love
The one love left behind",Ready Eddy
Duke Ellington,"Wrong
Would it be wrong to kiss
Seeing I feel like this?
Would it be wrong to try?

Wrong
Would it be wrong to stay
Here in your arms this way
Under this starry sky?

If it is wrong
Then why were you sent to me?
Why am I content to be
With you forever?

So, when I need you so much
And I have waited so long
It must be right
It can't be wrong",It Can't Be Wrong

Duke Ellington,"Some say that love is sweet as a rose,
Some say it's honey and the bee,
Well sit right down and let me tell you
What my love is to me.

""Candy""
I call my sugar ""Candy""
Because I'm sweet on ""Candy""
And ""Candy"" is sweet on me

He/She understands me,
My understanding ""Candy""
And ""Candy""'s always handy
When I need sympathy
I wish that there were four of him/her
So I could love much more of him/her

He/She has taken my complete heart,
Got a sweet tooth for my sweetheart
""Candy""
Its gonna be just dandy
The day I take my ""Candy""
And make him mine all mine
Mine",Candy
Duke Ellington,"If you are but a dream
I hope I never waken
It's more than I could bear
To find that I'm forsaken

If you're a fantasy
Then I'm content to be
In love with lovely you
And pray my dream comes true

I long to kiss you
But I would not dare

You may vanish in the air

But deep in my heart
I know that you love me

Keep us so near while we're apart
I'm not alone in the night
When I can have all the love you write

I memorize every line
I kiss the name that you sign
And, darling, then I read again 
Right from the start

I memorize every line

Love letters straight from your heart",Love Letters
Duke Ellington,"Though folks with good intentions
Tell me to save my tears
Well I'm so mad about him
I can't live without him

Never treats me sweet and gentle
The way he should
I've got it bad
And that ain't good

My poor heart is sentimental
Not made of wood
I've got it bad
And that ain't good
And when the weekend's over
And Monday rolls around

I end up like I start out
Just crying my heart out
He don't love me like I love him
No, nobody could

I take a book down from the shelf
And what with programs on the air
I keep pretty much to myself

Missed the Saturday dance

Don't get around much anymore

Though I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked about you
Don't get around much anymore

Might have gone, but what for?
Awfully different without you

And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to me

When I remember every little thing
You used to do
I'm so lonely

Duke Ellington,"I got the surprise, the surprise of my life
I had to stop and stare
I saw a man dancing with his own wife
And you'll never guess where

Chicago, Chicago--that toddlin' town, that toddlin' town
Chicago, Chicago--I'll show you around; I love it
Betcha bottom dollar you'll lose your blues
In Chicago, Chicago--the town that Billy Sunday could not shut down

On State Street, that great street
I just want to stay, I just want to stay
They do things they don't do on Broadway, say
They have the time, the time of their life

I saw a man who danced with his wife
In Chicago, Chicago, Chicago, Chicago
Free and easy town, brassy, breezy town
Chicago, Chicago

Let me cool my heels right down at Marshall Field
Come and walk with me along the lake to the drake
Holler and hoot all through the loop
Shout out now to Mrs. O'Leary's cow

No she-she, life is peachy
Chicago--we'll meet at the Pump Room Ambassador East
To say the least
On shishkabob and breast of squab we will feed and get free

Duke Ellington,"Darling, I'm so blue without you
I think about you the live-long day
When you ask me if I'm lonely
Then I only have this to say

You'll never know just how much I miss you
You'll never know just how much I care
And if I tried, I still couldn't hide my love for you
You ought to know, for haven't I told you so
A million or more times?

You went away and my heart went with you
I speak your name in my every prayer
If there is some other way to prove that I love you
I swear I don't know how
You'll never know if you don't know now

Kind night, bringing you nearer, dearer and dearer

Duke Ellington,"I never cared much for moonlit skies
I never wink back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes
I'm beginning to see the light

I never went in for afterglow
Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light

Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now

I never made love by lantern-shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light",Ellington Medley: I'm Beginning to See the Light

Duke Ellington,"I feel the autumn breeze; it steals 'cross my pillow
As soft as the willow, the wisp
And in its song there is sadness
Because there's no you

The lonely autumn trees as softly as they're sayin'
For someone's dying
They know that in my heart there's not gladness
Because there's no you

The pub that we walk in, the garden we tug in
Are lonesome, they seemed in the fall
The stormy clouds hover and falling leaves cover
Our favorite nook in the world

In spring we'll meet again, we'll kiss and recapture
The summer times raptured, we knew
And from that day nevermore will I say
There's no you",There's No You
Duke Ellington,"Days can be sunny with never a sigh
Don't need what money can buy
Birds in the trees sing their dayful of songs
Why shouldn't we sing along?
I'm chipper all the day

How do I get that way?
Look at what I've got

I got rhythm, I got music, I got my man

Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait till you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how about yours?
That's the way I like it and I never get bored

I need to get myself away from this place

Flying over the island
To my lover nearby

And the love that is true

The wind sings a song to you as you go

When he's near I'm fair and warmer
When he's gone I'm cloudy with showers;in emotion
Like the ocean it's either sink or swim
When a woman loves a man like I love him
Never treats me sweet and gentle the way he should
I got it bad and that ain't good!
My poor heart is sentimental not made of wood
I got it bad and that ain't good!
But when the weekend's over and Monday rolls aroun'
I end up like I start out just cryin' my heart out
He don't love me like I love him nobody could

Like a lonely weeping willow lost in the wood

And the things I tell my pillow no woman should

Duke Ellington,"He's home for a little while
He's mine once again
No need to tell, but it feels simply swell
With him close to me
Where he's supposed to be
He's home for a little while
I lived for his kiss; I hit the skies
When he looks in my eyes
And my knees grow weak with bliss
He's sort of changed
He's kind of different
From the boy I used to know a while ago
Strange how much he says without a word
And when he holds my hand I understand
I'm his, but for ever more
He's mine, mine alone
We'll have to part
But he's close to my heart
For the little while he's home",He's Home for a Little While
Duke Ellington,"You're clear out of this world
When I'm looking at you
I hear out of this world
The music that no mortal ever knew

You're right out of a book
The fairy tale I read when I was five
No armored knight out of a book
Was more enchanted by a Loralie
Then I

After waiting so long
For the right time
After reaching so long for a star
All at once from long and lonely night time
And despite time, here you are

I cry, ""out of this world""
If you said we were through
So let me fly out of this world
And spend the next eternity or two
With you",Out of This World

And in the evenin' when the lights are low
I'm so lonely I could cry
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me

Till it wilted, I wore it; I'll always adore it

Just made that much silk and then crawled in the ground
For there never was anything like it before

Still it wears in my memory

My love song so loudly

Good things come to those who wait
So just relax and wait for fate
To let me see the day you'll say to me
I love you, love you madly

But since it's so
I thought you oughta know
I love you, madly

And that's for sure
Just like I said before
I love you, love you madly

If you could see the happy you and me
I dream about so proudly
You'd know the breath of spring
That makes me sing
My love song so loudly

To let me see the day you'll say to me
I love you madly

Love you madly
Right or wrong
Sounds like a lyric of a song
But since it's so
I thought you oughta know
I love you, madly

Better fish are in the sea
Is not the theory for me
And that's for sure
Just like I said before
I love you, madly

If you could see the happy you and me
I dream about so proudly
You'd know the breath of spring
That makes me sing
My love song so loudly

Good things come to those who wait
So just relax and wait for fate
To let me see the day you'll say to me

Duke Ellington,"You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die. 

You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".",Mood Indigo (Dreamy Blues)
Duke Ellington,"It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Dear one, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you

It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you

Here I go singing low,
Bye bye blackbird.

Where someone waits for me
Sugars sweet and so is he,
Bye bye blackbird.

No one here can love and understand me,
Oh what hard luck stories they all hand me.

Make my bed and light the light
I'll arrive late tonight,
Bye bye blackbird",Bye Bye Blackbird
Duke Ellington,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Everywhere
Everywhere
Everywhere",A  Foggy Day in London Town
Duke Ellington,"You're a nobody till somebody loves you
You're nobody till somebody cares
You may be king, you may possess the world and its gold
But gold won't bring you happiness when you're growin' old

The world still is the same, you'll never change it
As sure as the stars shine above
You're nobody till somebody loves you
Find yourself somebody to love

You're a nobody till somebody loves you
You're nobody till somebody cares
You may be a king, you may possess the whole world and its gold
But gold won't bring you happiness when you're gettin' old

The world still is the same, you'll never change it
As sure as the stars shine above
You're nobody, nobody till somebody loves you
So find yourself somebody

Because you're nobody till somebody loves you
You're nobody till somebody cares
You may a king, you might possess the big fat world and its gold
But gold won't bring you happiness when you're growin' old

As sure as the stars shine above

So find yourself somebody somebody to love",You're Nobody 'Til Somebody Loves You
Duke Ellington,"I have almost every thing a human could desire
Cars and houses, bear-skin rugs to lie before my fire
But there's something missing; something isn't there
It seems I'm never kissing the one whom I care for

[Chorus]
I want something to live for
Someone to make my life an adventurous dream
Oh, what wouldn't I give for
Someone who'd take my life and make it seem
Gay as they say it ought to be
Why can't I have love like that brought to me?

My eye is watching the noon crowds
Searching the promenades, seeking a clue
To the one who will someday be my
Something to live for

[Chorus]

My eye is watching the noon crowds
Searching the promenades, seeking a clue
To the one who will someday be my
Something to live for",(I Want) Something to Live For
Duke Ellington,"Like the beat, beat, beat of the tom-tom
When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick, tick, tock of the stately clock
As it stands against the wall

Like the drip, drip, drip of the raindrops
When the summer shower is through
So a voice within me keeps repeating you, you, you
Night and day, you are the one

Only you beneath the moon or under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, darling, where you are
I think of you

Day and night, night and day, why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room?

I think of you
Day and night, night and day
Under the hide of me
There's an, oh, such a hungry yearning burning inside of me

And this torment won't be through
Until you let me spend my life making love to you
Day and night, night and day",Night and Day
Duke Ellington,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When [Alternate Version 1]
Duke Ellington,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing

Duke Ellington,"There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No greater love,
No heart so true

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing to me

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known,
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you",(There is) No Greater Love
Duke Ellington,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Duke Ellington,"Missed the Saturday dance
Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore

Though I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore

Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease
But, nevertheless, why stir up memories?

Been invited on dates
Might have gone, but what for?
Awfully different without you
Don't get around much anymore",Never No Lament
Duke Ellington,"I've got the world on a string
I'm sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world, what a life, I'm in love

I've got a song that I sing
I can make the rain go
Any time I move my finger
Lucky me, can't you see, I'm in love

Life's a wonderful thing
As long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so-and-so
If I should ever let her go",I’ve Got the World on a String
Duke Heitger,"Give me a kiss to build on and my imagination will thrive upon that kiss
Sweetheart I ask no more than this, a kiss to build a dream on
 
Give me a kiss before you leave me and my 
Imagination will feed my hungry heart
Leave me one thing before we part, a kiss to build a dream on
When I'm alone with my fancies, I'll be with you 
Weaving romances, making believe they're true
 
Give me your lips for just a moment and my 
Imagination will make that moment live
Give me what you alone can give, a kiss to build a dream on",A Kiss to Build a Dream On
Duke Heitger,"I saw a blind man,
He was a kind man,
Helping a fellow along,
One could not see,
One could not walk,

The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you.
 
I used to worry,
I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,
Learned wrong from right,
And you'll never hear me complain;

The whole world smiles with you,

Duke Heitger,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love
I sit in my chair

Filled with despair
There's no one, no one
No onecould be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love
",Solitude
Duke Jordan,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Duke Jordan,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues
Duke Jordan,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need

Duke Robillard,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

Pierdo la voluntad
No te das cuenta que
Eres mi debilidad
Sin estrategias ya
Y sin disimular
Voy acercarme despacio
Y no vas a escapar

Arriésgate
Tal vez las cosas que te han dicho
De mi no son
Ni la mitad de lo que soy
O lo haces tú o lo hago yo

Prefiero pedir perdón que pedir permiso
A un niño
Déjame moverte el piso
Prefiero ser yo la que hable antes
De guardarme esas ganas locas de besarte

Ya no me importa que dirán
Ni salir en primera plana mañana
Solo quiero perderme en tus brazos
Hasta ya no poder respirar

Oh oh oh
O lo haces tú o lo hago yo
Oh oh oh

Prefiero pedir perdón que pedir permiso
A un niño
Déjame moverte el piso
Prefiero ser yo la que hable antes
De guardarme esas ganas locas de besarte

Prefiero pedir perdón que pedir permiso
A un niño
Déjame moverte el piso
Prefiero ser yo la que hable antes

Pide champagne para ocultar tu soledad
Te busquen por puro interés que estupidez
Para empezar no gastes más
Hay cosas que no se pueden comprar

No tengo una etiqueta en la piel (en mi piel)
Mírame otra vez
No existe una tarjeta que pueda apagar el incendio de mi cuerpo

Los shots de amor matan los nervios
Siente el calor, dosis de besos
Los shots de amor y nos quedamos tu y yo ardiendo

Te acercas más sin preguntar, no hay marcha atrás
Besándote desde las tres
Nos sorprende al amanecer

No tengo una etiqueta en la piel (en mi piel)

En cada abrazo que te dí
En cada paso que das

No sera la ultima vez

Te quedarás conmigo, seguirás en mí

Lo que es eterno no se puede matar
Nunca me olvides
Nunca me olvidaré de ti

Quédate en mi corazón, tatuado en lineas de tu piel
Y se comienza a sangrar, seguramente sera yo
Llorando por nosotros dos
Lágrimas de soledad
A donde estés yo llegaré como un gran señal

Curious of what your feelings are you go

Losing sight of that familiar touch you know,

Scared of letting all that comfort disappear.",Unfamiliar

Duncan Browne,"A prima donna, slipped into her leather 
But she was restless 
She knew it in her heart of hearts 
She said ""Tonight you'd better pull yourself together, 
Because tonight I'm gonna pull myself apart!"" 
Out on the streets 
Everyone is searchin' for a thrill 
But she's the only one that's out there 
really dressed to kill 
And she said ""Listen to me, it's not a tragedy, 
This time I'm gettin' thorough and now there's 
something you can do for me! 

And oh, oh, take me to the Wild Places 
And let me show you what the night is for 
Cos I don't wanna dream 
I wanna set the wheels in motion 
I don't wanna see your eyes across a dancin' floor"" 

TV angel with her eyes full of smoke 
Gazin' at the hero, he's so mucho macho 
He shrugs, he says ""This must be some kind on joke."" 
As she pulls on his cigarette and loves him to distraction. 
But she cries, ""I don't wanna feel like a machine 
I'm not the only one who wants to feel the in-between 
That's why I'm deep into this state of fascination 
That's why I've lost the art of conversation. 

And oh, oh, take me to the Wild Places 
If you wanna see what's really in my soul 
But you'd better keep your eye on where my pretty face is 
Cos in the heat of the moment I just lose control 
In the heat of the moment, I just lose control!"" 

Eyes out of focus, the sharpening of blades 
The sad tension, reek of patchouli 
Even the jokers are dealin' in spades 
It's one dimension, it's all so passé' 
Just then a voice said, 
""Honey, it's too late to change your mind"" 
Her face tightened 
I could see she'd found a new design 
and she said, ""Listen to me, it's just a fantasy 
This time I'm comin through 
and now there's something you can do for me... 
There's something you can do for me! 

And oh, oh, take me to the Wild Places 
And let me show you what the night is for 
I don't wanna dream, I wanna set the wheels in motion 
Cos' in the heat of the moment I just lose control 
In the heat of the moment I just lose control.""

El que nos cuida
Y el que nos mata

Y es que amor
Y es que el amor
Es un animal perdido

Y es este amor de manos blancas
El que nos cuida
Y el que nos mata",Y Es Que el Amor
Duncan Dhu,"Las palabras duelen más
Cuando son tan limpias
Como la lluvia
Y la tarde está muriendo
Y la tarde está muriendo

Esto no es nada
Tú y yo llegamos hasta aquí
Llegamos hasta aquí

Sin darnos cuenta
Que el amor se nos quedó
Se nos quedó en el coche
Y afuera otra vez
La tarde muere

A veces creo caer
Desde el techo del mundo
Desnudo y ciego
Y no hay nadie junto a mí
Y no hay nadie junto a mí

Esto no es nada
Tú estás de nuevo a mi lado
Aunque el amor esté en el coche

Esto no es nada
Aunque parezca el final
Sólo la tarde está muriendo
Y afuera otra vez
La tarde muere
La tarde está muriendo

Duncan Dhu,"Una pausa, un respiro 
No hay combustible para despegar 
Las dunas teñidas de rubio platino 
Tendidas de espaldas a la inmensidad 

No habrá enigmas para acariciar 
Cuando te alejes de mí 
Los desiertos se cruzan en ningún lugar 
Nos veremos allí

Los sueños sueñan, las estrellas se estrellan 
Las promesas prometen paraísos perdidos 
Las penas llegan, las flechas vuelan 
Las vida avanza con el labio partido 
No habrá dinero para pagar 
Lo que te lleves de mí 
Sírveme una copa en la que naufragar 
Cuando te largues de aquí 

Compré una ficha en un túnel de lavado 
Para este polvoriento corazón 
Y preguntarle a la cara 
A este viento cansado 
Cuánto duele pedir perdón 
Cuando llegue el fin 
Cuando llegue el fin 

Una pausa, un respiro 
La rosa de los vientos que se pudra al sol 
Un nigromante arrepentido 
Entre nubes de olvido y vapores de alcohol 
Quema todo aquello que no cumplí 
Cuando te acuerdes de mí 
No quedarán eternidades para compartir 
Cuando llegue el fin 

Compré una ficha en un túnel de lavado 
Para este polvoriento corazón 
Y preguntarle a la cara 
A este viento cansado 
Cuánto duele pedir perdón

This feeling inside me
Is almost more than I can take
Baby when you touch me
I can feel how much you love me
And it just blows me away
I've never been this close to anyone or anything
I can hear your thoughts
I can see your dreams

I don't know how you what you do
I'm so in love with you, it just keeps getting better
I wanna spend the rest of my life with you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Baby I'm amazed by you

The smell of your skin
The taste of your kiss
The way you whisper in the dark
Your hair all around me, baby you surround me
You touch everyplace in my heart
Oh, it feels like the first time everytime
I wanna spend the whole night in your eyes

I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you, it just keeps getting better

There is a dream I keep alive.,
Wonderful and heavenly standing by
Your side.
Bringing you all the colours love can
Spare just to be with you.

Should have been there to hold you
Through the night.

It's a race that should have never been run

Might as well share the pain

Worth the price, the price that I would pay

Everyone keeps asking, what's it all about?
I used to be so certain and I can't figure out
What is this attraction? I only feel the pain
There's nothing left to reason and only you to blame
Will it ever change?

You say you are happy
Do you think this is fun?
Well it's only a firefly to the light of the sun
You say this is living, you feel so alive
Well you know everything dies

It flows through the heart of us

It don't seem that different 'cause nothing has changed
I try to remember, try to remember
When we were just running in place
Reasons for living, never come cheap
But even your best ones can put me to sleep
What I am saying or trying to say
Is that there must be a better way

It's already in you, it's already there
You may disagree, but I don't really care
Did you ever find out, did you ever find out
What's at the heart of us?
Did you ever find out
Did you ever find out what's at the heart?

Tell me all your wildest dreams
You don't really care, you don't know what they mean
Raiding in the closets, skeleton keys
You know it's easier than you think

Duncan Sheik,"So what, life's tough 
You should get over yourself 
Like everyone else and enjoy 
The girls and the boys 
And everything in between 
Serena, in an effort to avoid 
The things that annoy you 
You hide- far, far away 
And life just passes you by 

Are you gonna give up 
Are you gonna give out 
Ain't that a shame 
You've got no one to blame 
But your conscience 
If it doesn't make sense 
I know that only too well 
So tell me 
Did it happen one day 
When the day that you faced 
Wasn't happening 
It just didn't bring 
Anything more
Anything more than despair 

Do you remember, morning would come 
And just like a child filled with the sun 
And the hours never seemed long 
Where have those days gone? 
Beyond us,
Or so you would believe 
But I can't agree, those illusions 
Will you ever get through them 
And find the diamond
Find the diamond inside",Serena

Oh darlin' don't you know
The darkness comes and the darkness goes
Oh babe why don't you let it go?
Happiness ain't never how you think it should be so 

I mystified the simple life
I covered up with consciousness
I saw myself and broke it down
'Til nothing more was left

And spoke to me in poetry
""Sometimes the more you wonder why
The worse it seems to get""

But she runs away
She runs away

And then you know there comes a time
You need her more than anything
You may believe yours are the wounds
That only she can heal
Then everything will turn around
And she becomes so serious
What she chose to offer you
Was all that you could have

Of giving you the easy way out

Some say, it's all coming to an end 
Some fool themselves with thoughts of new beginnings 
It makes me wonder what they believe 
Cause we're in between 
Sometimes it's just better to get on with it 
Sometimes lord knows you gotta get off 
There's no use holding on to what I mean 
Cause I'm in between, no use wondering what I mean

You will be strong, you will be sung

To rooms with oyster shells for walls
To sandy nooks, and pearly books and ivory dolls

That used to hold her tight until the dawn
And now they weep to find that she is gone
This is how my heart heard

I forgot the taste of fears
And how they haunt the lips you're kissing
And how the soul can waste its tears
On someone who is missing

And how I shed such tears but never cry
This is how I want her
And how I kiss her lips and taste goodbye
This is how I want her

I forgot the taste of fears
And how they haunt the lips you're kissing
And how the soul can waste its tears
On someone who is missing

This is how I want her
And how I shed such tears but never cry
And how I kiss her lips and taste goodbye
This is how my heart heard
This is how my heart heard
This is how my heart heard",This Is How My Heart Heard
Duncan Sheik,"Drifter, what about her conversation?
Drifter, how about an explanation
Where you go, when you receive
And why you never let her feed
On all that truth you hold so dear
But never let another near

[Chorus]
No one around
My, don't we love
No one around

No, to the quiet gazes
No, to the muttered phrases
No, to the utter waste of
Time and good fortune

Taster of the poetry
Of Pater, Prousi, and Socrates
What are you to do but sleep
And when are you to stop and weep
For all your inability
To mate with your own memory

[Chorus]

No, to the mindless gazes
No, to the splintered phrases
No, to the utter waste of
Time and good fortune

Singer, will the singing say it?
Singer, would such saying change it?
A whole long life spent tuning strings
And will it now mean anything
But empty chords that only bring
An endless, voiceless sorrowing

No, to the frightened gazes
No, to the stuttered phrases
No, to the utter waste of

In the winter moon
Stars within the darkness.
They remember you
And they sorrow too
With all the winds that blow.

Every book you'd read
In my evening breeze
Stars shown in the darkness.
Still it waits to see
Will you turn in sleeves
With all the winds that blow

See the window too,
That once you looked through,
Out on the stars, the darkness.
It remembers you in this empty room,
With all the winds so cold.

And that phantom moon
Is a window too,
Stars look through the darkness,
To some summer moon
Where our ghosts still move
Among the winds that blow.

Were my soul and my silence,
Were my hope, my lightness.
Were the sword at my side
Through all the winds that blow.

Now the children play
Through these shorter days
'Til stars show through the darkness.
Now the young men stray, nobody waves
Among the winds that blow.

In the winter moon.
Stars within the darkness.
They'll remember you,
They will sorrow too.
And all the winds will blow.

For you I'm gonna sit and patiently wait

You're a beautiful girl, and want you to know it [Repeat: x3]

If she only knew it
But somewhere in her radius
I really blew it

So incredibly stupid

(you don't really need to know every last detail. 
Its hardly worth telling
Suffice to say I said that I would be there
I never came through)

Maybe I'm a genius and
She just don't see it
I fronted, 
I should have admitted,
She saw right through it
I never thought that I could be
So underhanded.
Somehow I've cornered the market on
The double standard

For this act of genius
And so many others
I know I should apologize
And see how it goes

What am I waiting for?

Duncan Sheik,"I awake to find the devil
Sitting near my bed
We have a conversation
He says,
Good morning Mr. Cut-throat
These are most exciting times
We are surrounded by fools and crooks,
Strangers that give us dirty looks,
So many different people to despise

It's tearing you apart
You haven't got the heart
I don't mean to complain, but it seems a little strange
Good evening, Mr. Turncoat!
Well done!

You've been watching the so-called news
(and now you see it)
That no news is good news
We don't want to confuse
The popular pursuit of absolute truth
And who has the time for such remote endeavors
You want to disappear
How did you end up here?
I don't mean to complain
But it seems a little strange
Take me to your leader
I sure could use a laugh
(I hear) he's made a new bird feeder
And he sleeps in a birdbath
Who needs to join the circus
Come on, just look around
We are surrounded
By a bunch of fucking clowns!

They sing...
They all sing...
We all sing...
Everybody sing...

It's tearing you apart
You haven't got the heart
You sit there and complain, it seems a little late
Good morning Mr. Misanthrope
I sure do hope you remember our terms",Good Morning!

Before the truth goes back into hiding
I want to decide 'cause it's worth deciding
To work on finding something more than this fear

It takes so much out of me to pretend
Tell me now, tell me how to make amends

Maybe, I need to see the daylight
To leave behind the half-life

For cigarettes I brought

Some things she left behind
Nothing really happens
In ways I can't define

Loose talk of hearts and heads
Of sleep in other beds
It's better left unsaid

To a happy home and comfortable children

Duncan Sheik,"Simeon, he was a man,
Held his heart out in his hand,
A hollow land of autumn breeze

Evenings in the brittle rain,
Leaves that fill the barren plain
With simple embroideries

In the temple yesterday,
Was a man, who came to pray,
Who couldn't stay and couldn't leave.

So, he fell down on his knees,
Sued for grace and sued for peace,
A little ease, and not to grieve

Marion, she met a man,
Took her to Jerusalem,
To take a stand, escape a scene

To wander in the honey sea,
Drink the milk of Memory,
And never be herself again.

In the temple yesterday,
Was a woman came to pray
Who couldn't say, and couldn't see.

So, she fell down on her knees,
Sued for grace and sued for peace,
Sued the priest, to set her free.

Chased by storms
Always safe

To a hurricane town
Fallen down bombs
Wishing for snowbound home

And still, I'm wandering

To separate my dreams from false cliches

Still, there's this one thing: just to see you go by
It's almost like lovin', sad as that is

It's like I'm your lover, or more like your ghost—
I spend the day wonderin' what you do, where you go

I try and just kick it, but then what can I do?

It's chill in the wind, but it's warm in your arms
We stop, all snow-blind, may not be true
We've all got our junk, and my junk is you

Well you'll have to excuse me, I know it's so off
I love when you do stuff that's rude and so wrong

I go up to my room, turn the stereo on
Shoot up some you, and the ""you"" is some song

And play out these scenes (These scenes)
I ride on the rush (The rush)

Wake me from the dead

And take the whole world down with me
Into my dime-story tragedy

Just like the Sun and every ray

Duncan Sheik,"So you wrote me a letter which I thought was really kind
I don't recall which song it was but there was one you really liked
And you asked me, so innocently, of my inspiration
Why I write the songs I sing, the reasons why I make them

Well, nothing here is what it seems
I'll risk the wreckage of your dreams
It's so that you are always shopping
To steal away the cash you're dropping
Listen to me when I say
Your fantasies are built to fade
So there you are, you're always shopping
Don't even try, there is no stopping

Don't misunderstand me, it always makes me smile
When I can serenade you as you're rollin' down the aisles
On this journey of your souls desire, the paradise of goods
You're doing just exactly what I think you should

Well, nothing here is what it seems

So while you roll you're really rocking

Listen to me when I say
Your fantasies are built to fade
So there you are, you're always wanting
What you don't have it always haunting

There's still one more thing I have to say - my confession's not complete
I've made it sound as if all this has nothing to do with me
There surely is not anything further from the truth
When I have pretty things to gain and only useless things to lose

I wish there were another way
But I must keep the wolves at bay
I hope that you don't find it shocking
Rock and Roll is built on shopping

If you're searching for my soul
Come check out my chains of gold
Grab your purse and let's go shopping
For lingerie and silky stockings

Let's go shopping together
So that we can find ourselves
So that we can buy our selves

Cause we are always by ourselves
Cause we are always by ourselves

All that you can do is cry, to heaven above

Secret places, stolen gazes, soft exchanges all you ever dream
It will change you, how it pains you when its cold

Set upon a northern shore
The denizens of lighthouse
During times of war

The foolish things they did
The foolish things they said
I'm sure you will agree
They would be better off dead

Lilly keeps the lighthouse
She's afraid the unknown 
She's no ray of sunshine
So mostly she's alone

And no one cares about her longing
Or the dreams on which she's fed
And though I'm sad to say it
She would be better off dead

Next we have a sheriff 
Charles is his name
He's something of a sideshow
Every sheriff is the same

Will he stand for justice
Or something else instead
Either way it hardly matters
He's better off dead

When everything is done
And everything is said
Life is naught but pain
It's better to be dead

Release your heavy heart
Rest your weary head
When all the world's at war
It's better, it's better

Witness Yasujiro
He hails from old Japan
He searches for redemption
In this strange and foreign land

And now he works for Lilly
To earn his daily bread
But the most that one can say
Is that he's better off dead

Please welcome young Christopher
He's come here on a train
His father flew to heaven
On a fiery airplane

He's come to live with Lilly
And he's got visions in his head
He may be our main attraction
But he's better off dead

When everything is done
And everything is said
Life is naught but pain
It's better to be dead

Release your heavy heart
Rest your weary head
When all the world's at war
It's better to be dead

Everything is done 
All things are said

It's better, it's better to be dead

Duncan Sheik,"Listen if you will, I have a tale to tell.
Of an unfortunate man, the name of Solomon Snell,
And the philosophy he should have embraced,
That says no matter what you do,
You'll never be safe.

Ring the bell, ring the bell
For Solomon Snell.
Too much trust,
Is the road to Hell

Rightfully nervous,
He took every precaution,
He paid three armed men to drive him to Boston.
But wouldn't you know it, he was broke on arrival.
His own men robbed him and took off in style.

So he wanted to marry, a girl who was true,
And on the basis of her name he would fidelity prove.
She had a handsome cousin she would visit in Charlotte.
Well she said he was her cousin,
The brazen harlot.

Ring the bell, ring the bell
For Solomon Snell.
He played it safe,
And it didn't end well.

Ring the bell, ring the bell
For Solomon Snell.
Too much trust
Is the road to hell.

He caught yellow fever,
Down Charleston way.
Before you knew it, they were digging his grave.
But he was most terrified of being buried alive.
And so to his finger a bell was tied.

You see Snell had arranged for a man to be paid,
To listen for the bell when he was buried in his grave.
But the man got drunk, and when the bell did sound,
Solomon lived but he stayed in the ground.

No one heard a sound.

Ring the bell, ring the bell
For Solomon Snell.
Too much trust is the road to hell.

Ring the bell, ring the bell
For Solomon Snell.
You can play it safe,
But it wont end well.

You can play it safe,
But it wont end well.
You can play it safe,
But it wont end well",The Tale of Solomon Snell
Duncan Sheik,"Indeed there's such a thing as ghosts
More to cause you fear
You never know just where or when
But surely they'll appear

Quiet men turn into wolves
During certain moons
And sirens sing their siren songs
Sweet and deadly tunes

We're here to tell you
All of this is real
And if you're terrified today
It's how you're supposed to feel
For real
We're here to tell you
Ghosts are here for good
And if this doesn't terrify you
It should, it should

Don't you know the feeling

Ride through poison rains

And in the grand design
And once he gets your number
He calls you all the time

Dune,"Sea Song
You look different every time
You come from the foam, crested brine
It's your skin shining softly in the moonlight
Partly fish, partly porpoise
Partly baby sperm whale
Am I yours? Are you mine to play with?

Joking apart, when you're drunk
You're terrific when you're drunk
I like you mostly late at night, you're quite alright 
But I can't understand the different you in the morning
When it's time to play a being human for a while
We smile, we smile, we smile
You'll be different in the spring, I know
You're a seasonal beast

Like the starfish that drift in with the tide, with the tide
So until your blood runs to meet the next full moon
Your madness fits in nicely with my own, with my own
Your lunacy fits neatly with my own
My very own
We're not alone",Sea Song

Share the rest of my life
Share my innermost thoughts

He'll get my support

He will listen to me
When I want to speak
About the world we live in
And life in general

Though my views may be wrong 
they may even be perverted
He'll hear me out 
And won't easily be converted

To my way of thinking
In fact he'll often disagree
But at the end of it all
He will understand me
Aaaahhhhh

I want somebody who cares
For me passionately
With every thought
And with every breath

Someone who'll help me see things
In a different light
All the things I detest
I will almost like

I don't want to be tied
To anyone's strings
I'm carefully trying to steer clear
Of those things

But when I'm asleep
I want somebody
Who will put their arms around me
And kiss me tenderly

Make me sick
In a case like this
I get away with it

Even (?) for no team, I swing dissipainted lines
Stroke after them, apple martinis
I live kosher, I'm the most-a like the art
Took my moves from Billy Whiteshoes
Fight back like Geronimo, crack comma Ustafa
who said, ""Like the sky, like a hot fire""
Dorcey put a hit up on that man, control red
Some watchin liberation, abberation house down ya throat
Tapdance on ya kidneys, come around that ass like measles
The first and the second shots ain't nuttin but teasers
Set your body afire like Watson
Travel through yo' team like hydrotoxins
Premium dutch, blood shift you closer to the edge
Project push, A-T-L - you get yo' water out the faucet,
we get our water out the well
We win the war with Miami boys over these streets to eat
Channel 5 got the story of the day
Old church burnin, Emma got hung
and the student caught with a gun, Wayne Williams interviews
Remote controlled cars for teachers
in Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4, Zone 5
Whattcha gon' do, who ya gon' call?
The (?) gun show? Now nigga come on!

Breakin they neck tryna run, but Dungeon niggaz done been ran

We slum deeper studio-type, breakin great entrepreneurs
Alert, it's a all out emergency homes
Hit up, slick Ricky Wade on my cellular phone
Man my group done broke up, just starters claimin we rock
It's my destiny to make it, I'm a fuckin survivor
This might be one again, oh hailin in the blaze that we brought

Come through ya front do' and letcha know fa sho'

Dungeon Family,"Ask not what the family can do for you
Ask only what you can do for the family

This is my pledge, this is my pledge to we and all those that come after
Let's talk about it 'posed to assimilate, insyncopate
Euphoric you raw superstitions, appear with information
Hesitation, metaphoric in a solid state of logic

Focusin' on me and the family, gawkin'
Parallel parkin' was a art form
Atilla the Hun, school that I wrote to write
Spoke for some to speak, provided cobblestone

Stole to steal parone, cut the heart up out of Caesar
I protect the black Madonna shrine from seizures
I survived the 80's child killings
Excruciating pain like a root canal without a filling

Forever we, pillars in this stature in this Ascap rapture
Wordplay that will snatch ya, mangle ya mind
Signed upper bull pull, I relinquish
To become forever more Excalibur
To become forever more Excalibur

Caliber unknown, infinite in stature
Indiscriminate fracture, syndicated rapture
Indicated capture, syncopated nature
Defeated we raise the wager no secret, I hate the majors

But they major players, so I'm a gladiatin'
Not so glad we waitin', niggaz is graduatin'
Fuck what flag we wavin', kids is misbehavin'
Parents is worse than Satan, apparently church is pagan

Sworn away my freedom through words that sing my freedom
Rebirth the world of the earth in intent to spin my freedom
Prepared to defend the next-us didn't get in for no Lexus
Didn't get on through connections or to get off my erection

Fuck the soft and the wetness, luck is lost in election
Bucket that caused the detection sent to impossible reactions
Still to much to achieve, we build to much to believe
Fear to much to receive, appear before you achieve

We are the few, we are the strong
We are the proud holders of the Excalibur
We are the few, we are the strong
We are the proud holders of the Excalibur

We are the few, we are the strong
We are the proud holders of the Excalibur
We are the few, we are the strong
We are the proud holders of the Excalibur

Guess I was wrong, [Incomprehensible] sworn
Promise to make it show that, the legend of dungeon live on
Even knowledge I known and heights I flown
I alone can't snatch the sword up out the stone

The charged chastities here, have to cock outta fear
Matter of fact, I apologize
Lyric far, witness to suck the star
May the force be with us, for we are

We are the few, we are the strong
We are the proud holders of the Excalibur
We are the few, we are the strong
We are the proud holders of the Excalibur

We are the few, we are the strong
We are the proud holders of the Excalibur
We are the few, we are the strong
We are the proud holders of the Excalibur

Eyes'll have you so puffed up until you eventually flow up
And bust on their or buck to their [Incomprehensible]
Drag the slayer, oh we ain't forgot about you playa
You still don't weigh enough, I gotcha beat off the rip
From the jump, keep it still to relapse on that junk

Pump fake, off ya feet
Fall on this sword ya beat with eggs on ya face
Amazing grace, how sweet it is the shit we spit
Thicker still, niggaz don't deserve to live

It's gettin' so goosy where a girl
Can kill her baby the next day by takin' a pill
Breakin' off beat, when they blow the horns
They open up the rest of them seals

Out wit yo' head for not keepin' the ears real
Walkin' through the valley of the drop
Bone lookin' for my damn drone
Where ya at? I see ya, I see ya
Come on let's get 'em dawg come on

If I got one my nigga you got one
He got one, they got one
Them motherfuckers gon' make them a damn gun

We are the few, we are the strong
We are the proud holders of the Excalibur
We are the few, we are the strong
We are the proud holders of the Excalibur

We are the few, we are the strong
We are the proud holders of the Excalibur

Showed me light through the power of chi and your intent to see
You teach for He, discretely
Givin them a piece of me -- the peace was free, gone

What I need, what I want, what I see
Is two different things, two different...

Origin purpose be partially profound of the very power that's in me

Jesus is my older brother evidently, experiment in me
Let the complexity collapse the pocket quickly
Life is but a dream, ya row ya boat gently
It's cool to have a Bentley, I want a Bentley
Yet I ponder why, I smoke my presence prominently?
If you want your mind blow, look we're all alone... Follow the light

Saville so motherfucking clean
It's got a soda shade around the mean green
These youngster have never seen
It has a signature wood grain steering wheel such as yours
But oh my God what are harder are the hard wood floors
It's not coincidental all the glass was kept clear
Who's worried his or her first shit it's freezing it here
The only heat is my piece to make it even at least
I'll go to work without even catching a crack in my crease
I guess the dubs out there do what they 'posed to do
I'll ride 15mph to make a believers out of you

A sacred why? A myst'ry gaping inside

Between the shades, assassination standing still.
The first crystal tears
Fall as snowflakes on your body,
First time in years,
To drench your skin with lover's rosy stain.
A chance to find a phoenix for the flame,
A chance to die, but can we

Dance into the fire,

Twist it in a vice

Just use your naked eyes, oh,
How to see and how to hide it,
How to save it, well, maybe, maybe, maybe,
You can take it and eat it, and chew your life supply

Where's the real life in your illusion?
On the dark side your power's in confusion,
Do the dance, do the demolition,
And lose the chance to hear when you don't listen

Don't you feel edgy?
Bite your lips and bleed,
Conversation is empty;
Abandoned in the freeze,
Freedom is your condemnation,
Free to say well, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe,
You can take it or leave it,
Just need a little hit tonight

We'll find enough there to feed you.
Soon you'll belong to the blessed
Spare us your lives while we need you.

Duran Duran,"[Chorus]
Take me every morning
Take me every night
Take me when you're feeling low
Take me when you want to stay
Up all night

Before you slip into the white
There's something I want you to know
In all your stretch of consciousness
You've still got a long way to go
Some make you spin
Some make you sweat
It's only here for you to choose
Some like it hot
But I like it wet, so tell me
What have we got to lose now?

[Chorus]

(A hit, a hit)
A hit to fit reality
It's just a state of mind
And you, and it - it's more than just
And that's what you've got to find
We'll make you spin
We'll make you sweat
All you have to do is choose me
And if you would try
And alternative high
Then tell me, what have we got to lose now?

Concrete beach to scrape my hand
Inside the subway stinking fear and shame
Becomes the violent breath.

I'm just a number on the metal fence
Which marks the great divide.

Sing it
Hey boy, give your dreams a rest
If you're tired of searching this is where it ends
There's nothing left to lose
Nothing to protest
Learn to love your anger now
Anger here is all you possess.
Welcome to the edge.

Below the towers of the citadel
Seems someone overlooked the cost.
Forgotten soldier of Paradise
Now Paradise is lost.
Recognition never realized
Salvation lost among the crowd
So tell me here beside the sterile sea
Where is your nation now?

And we say
Hey boy, give your dreams a rest

Duran Duran,"Venice breeding
Shy chimeras of sex and violence
In the purple evening silence
Venice dreaming of a partner

Fill you arms with breasts of marble
From the cradle to the table
Coax this naked treasure
From your saviour

Come swim into my love
Come swim into my life

Divine blasphemer
Tempting holy beads of jism
With the scarlet catechism
Her lips will answer
(Oh, her lips will answer)

How to be the perfect stranger
The perfect lover
Wanting
And as you'll discover
Giving
And as you'll discover
Being

Come swim into my love
Come swim into my life

Enter this sublime corrosion
Venice drowning in emotion

The body stirs and is reanimated
But only briefly and that life is very brief

Affogamento di Venezia nell'emozione
Vieni e nuota nel mio amore

Come up and see me, make me smile
Or do what you want, running wild

Beating of a moment til I disappear.

Manda um recado que seja agora (Send a message that is new)
Faz o mundo ficar novo
E dancar no colodo tal de amor (Make a new world and dance in the arms
of love)
From where I stand, the truth isn't black and white,
Alone we live and die, we love and fight,

Just as we slip on through to eternity
Breath after breath we carry this mortal coil,
Safe for tomorrow

Bem alegre (Very happy)
Corre, manda logo um recado (Run, send me a message)

of your love)
Danca do somo do rento,
Me ensina (Dance to the sound of the wind,

Basta de sufoco, Nao faz jogo (Stop the struggle, don't play games
with me)

A flame of love is burning
Always...
The song is of the planets
oh whoooooooo
The dance is to the rhythm, of the rain
Where everyone is coming from, is coming to
And birth is just a breath after breath.

They only come when they come when they wanna go 
get the morgue truck and then bag the goner
They don't care cause they get paid 
anyway they treat you like an ace that can't be betrayed
I know you's know with no use people if your life is on the line, 
then you're dead today
Late comers and the late comers stretcher 
that's a body bag in disguise y'all I'll betcha
I call 'em body snatchers quick they come to fetch you
With a autopsy ambulance just to dissect ya
They are the kings 'cos they swing amputation 
lose your arms your legs the famous compilation
I can prove it to you watch the rotation 
it all adds up to a funky situation

Get up get, get, get down 911 is a joke in yo town

He's a witness to the job never bein' 
done he would've been in full effect
911 is a joke cause their always jokin' 
they the token to your life when it's croakin'
They need to be in a pawn shop

the doctors huddle up and call a flea flicker
The reason that I say that 'cause they flick you off like fleas
They be laughin' at ya while you're crawlin' on our knees
And to the strength, so go the length 
thinkin' you are first when you really are tenth
You better wake up and smell the real flavor 
cause 911 is a fake life saver

And all along Santa Monica Blvd
Cars were stood still
And a gleaming metal tube
Would stretch all the way from the highlands
Back to La Brea.
And she met under Los Angeles sunshine
Young man was sitting at the wheel
On his way to make a pickup
Turned off the air-con
Rolled down the window
And began to sweat
Out over the Hollywood hills
He saw the clouds building 
Like great dark towers of rain
Ready to come tumbling down
Any day now
Not a day too soon
(Any day now)
And as the music drifted in
From other cars
His eyes started to slip
This is the story of his dream

Long shot of that jumping sign
Visible shivers running down my spine
Cut the baby taking off her clothes
Close-up of the sign that says we never close

I wonder who is it?

If you belong to the parents
Who are ready to hear the worst
About their daughter's disappearance
Though it nearly took a miracle to get you to stay
It only took my little fingers to blow you away

As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicone hump and your ten inchy stump
Dressed like a priest you was,
Todd browning beast you was

Crawling down the alley on your hands and knees
I'm sure you're not protected
For its plain to see
The diamond dogs are poachers
And they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will
Mannequins with kill-appeal

Will they come?
I keep a friend serene
Will they come?
Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come?
Well, she's come, been, and gone

Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch a death in the fog
Young girl they call them the diamond dogs
Young girl they call them the diamond dogs

Now Halloween jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan chase
The elevators broke so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below
Oh tarzie go man, go

Meets his little hussy with his ghost-town approach
Her face is sans feature but she wears a 
Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent something Mother 
Used to bake
Wrecked up and paralyzed
Diamond dogs are sable-ized

Will they come?
I keep a friend serene
Will they come?
Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come?
Well, she's come, been, and gone

(chorus)

In the year of the scavenger
The season of the bitch
Sashay on the board-walk scurry to the ditch
Just another future song lonely little kitch
There's gonna be sorrow try 
And wake up tomorrow

Will they come?
I keep a friend serene
Will they come?
Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come?
Well, she's come, been, and gone

Staring through a hole in the ozone

Bursting my eye
Sound of a morning sigh

It's all I recognize
Feeding off the habit
Losing control

Duran Duran,"Working on the weekend baby
She's working all through the night
A jump into the deep end gave her
The evidence she required
Take five she's got pearls

Don't fake it when it comes to
Making money, so
She smiles,
But that's cruel
If you knew what she'd think,
If you knew what she was after

Sometimes she wonders
And she laughs in her frustration

[Chorus]
Would someone please explain
The reason for this strange behavior
In exploitation's name
We must be working for the skin trade

Doctors of the revolution gave us
The medicine we desired
Besides being absolutely painless
It's a question of compromise
You've got steel
It's so cool

Get angry at the weekend
Then go back to school
So big deal it's what rules
When it comes to making money
Say yes, please, thank you

Sometimes you wonder
And you ask yourself the question

But I'm asking you the question

Face to face in secret places, feel the chill
Night fall covers me, but you know the plans I'm making
Still oversea, could it be the whole world opening wide
A sacred why, a mystery gaping inside
The weekend's why

Until we dance into the fire, that fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire, to fatal sounds of broken dreams
Dance into the fire, that fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire

Choice for you, is the view to a kill
Between the shades, assassination's standing still
The first crystal tears, fall as snowflakes on your body
First time in years, to drench you skin with lovers rosy stain
A chance to find the phoenix for the flame
A chance to die

But can we dance into the fire, that fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire, to fatal sounds of broken dreams
Dance into the fire, that fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire, when all we see is the view to a kill","Rio [12"" Dance Version]"

Overnight sensation
Smiling for cameras from all around the world.
If I rewind back to yesterday
And stop the tape there
No one knew who you were but now
They're at your door.

I'm living in a pop trash movie
We star together in every scene
We'll all be famous for just a few minutes
Part of a celluloid dream.

Watch in slo-mo going frame by frame
Might have blurred my vision
Your life went flashing by where
Did it all go wrong?

I'm living in a pop trash movie
We star together in every scene
We'll all be famous for fifteen minutes
Part of a celluloid dream.

I'll wait in the wings for you
I'll read your lines to you
But now the script is final
You know it's time to go
So we'll have to say goodbye.

I'm living in a pop trash movie
We star together in every scene
We'll all be famous for those fifteen minutes
Part of a celluloid dream.

And it's never quite what it seems

there's something I want to say

Is to let go

When love is real

To give yourself 
To someone else

And I could carry on with you
Does that sound crazy?
I think you feel the same way too
And you can't face it

But it's not defeat
When you set somebody free
And I know you're meant
To be yourself

Now that I am starting to remember
It takes a while
But you find a way to open up the door
Let demons walk
Now that I am starting to remember
Can't change my world

I was happy ever after
Was it only yesterday?
I bought the dream
But I don't sleep no more
Counting the hours
'Til the dawn

Now that I am starting to remember
How to love
How to learn 
Draw like the child
Run for miles and miles
Now that I am starting to remember

Buried in the darkening day
That lingers on
And drags me down
But you've got to believe
Time will heal.",Starting to Remember

Got to hold on together

Maybe the sun doesn't shine forever

Maybe it's something said in a movie or
You could've said last night
Just took me out on a limb
And I don't really know what I'm doing here

And sometimes I'm caught in a landslide
My beat's so in time, can you look at me
I'm out of reach, I'll talk if it feels right
I've had my last chance on the stairway

Funny it's just like a scene out of Voltaire
Twisting out of sight
'Cause when all the curtains are pulled back
We'll turn and see the circles we've traced

I can't say no more, baby dance with me
And please don't say leave it 'til later
I've had my last chance on the stairway

Wonder why, (wonder why ooh)
What makes me rise so high
Maybe it's something they put in your perfume

I don't even know what you're drinking

Echos growing in the heart of twilight
They lay back laughing at naivety's star
Awaken all those whispers
The dusty shadow of a passing favour
I wouldn't say that you were ruthless or right
I couldn't see from so far

Was I chasing after rainbows? 
One thing for sure, you never answered when I called
And I wiped away the water from my face
To look through the eyes of a stranger

For rumors in the wake of such a lonely crowd
Trading in my shelter for danger
I'm changing my name just as the sun goes down
In the eyes of the stranger

Can't tell the real from reflection
When all these faces look the same to me
In every city such a desolate dream
Some days are strange to number
Some say the seventh sounds a little bit stranger
A year of Sundays seems to have drifted right by
I could have sworn in one evening

And I'm not seized in desperation
No steel reproaches on the table from before
But I still can feel those splinters of ice
I look through the eyes of a stranger

For rumors in the wake of such a lonely crowd
Trading in my shelter for danger
I'm changing my name just as the sun goes down
In the eyes of the stranger

I must be chasing after rainbows 
One thing for sure you never answere when I call
And I wiped away the water from my face
To look through the eyes of a stranger

For rumors in the wake of such a lonely crowd
Trading in my shelter for danger
I'm changing my name just as the sun goes down
Walking away like a stranger

Trampled but still breathing.

The front of your dress, all shadowy lined
And the droning engine throbs in time

Swim seagull in the sky towards that hollow western isle
My envied lady holds you fast in her gaze

What glass splinters lie so deep in your mind

But the life cannot let go
It's a chain cuts across my soul
Anchoring in this world

I put my hand into the flame
Burning but I feel no pain
Don't speak, don't speak my name
Hold on to this life of chains

The door is standing open
But I'm too tired to be afraid
My whole life's in this moment
I've been fighting all the way

Just need a little more time

'cause the life just can't let go
It's a chain cuts across my soul
Anchoring in this world

I put my hand into the flame
Burning but I feel no pain
Don't speak, don't speak my name
Hold on to this life of chains

Nah nah nah nah nah

I put my hand into the flame
Burning but I feel no pain
Don't speak, don't speak my name
Hold on to this life of chains

You speak to the crowd but nobody hears
It's not a dream and you are no prize
And you're not alone come in from the fear

Gonna take it back
Take back the life that you want to lead
Been under quiet attack
But now it's time for you and me
Gonna take it back
You've got to fight for what you believe
We're gonna make this stand

When did our choice become erased?
Where is the violence in this crowd?
Now that our voice has been replaced
With a silence that screams out loud

There is nothing better
Than being with you 
And I'm feeling so nice

Than here with you

Duran Duran,"So soon just after you've gone
My senses sharpen
But it always takes so damn long
Before I feel how much my eyes have darkened

Fear hangs in a plane of gun smoke
Drifting in our room
So easy to disturb, with a thought, with a whisper
With a careless memory, with a careless memory

On the table, signs of love lies scattered
And the walls break, with a crashing within
It's not as though, as though you really mattered 
But being close, how could I let you go
Without some feeling, some precious sympathy following

Fear hangs in a plane of gun smoke
Drifting in our room
So easy to disturb with a thought, with a whisper
With a careless memory, with a careless memory
With a careless memory, with a careless memory

I walk out into the sun, I try to find a new day
But the whole place just screams in my eyes
Where are you now 'cause I don't want to meet you
I think I'd die, I think I'd laugh at you
I know I'd cry, what am I supposed to do, follow you

Outside the thoughts coming flooding back now
I just try to forget you

So easy to disturb with a thought with a whisper
With a careless memory, with a careless memory
With a careless memory, look out

Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand
Just like that river twisting through a dusty land
And when she shines she really shows you all she can
Oh Rio Rio dance across the Rio Grande

I've seen you on the beach and I've seen you on t.v.
Two, of a billion stars it means so much to me
Like a birthday or a pretty view
But then I'm sure that you know it's just for you

Hey now (wow) look at that did he nearly run you down
At the end of the drive the lawmen arrive you make me feel
Alive, alive, alive

I'll take my chance 'cause luck is on my side
I tell you something I know what you're thinking
I tell you something I know what you're thinking

And you've drained your loving cup
Come stands reeling to the shore

When the brave are coming out
The dry fight and the dusty shout
See you crawling on the floor

And diamond stars shine glitter bright
Gorging your sanhedralite

Words are falling to the floor
Glands stand pouring fruit tree
Now they glisten on the waterline
See how you are at the shore
I'm moving Chrissie pretty flowers in the shutter maze
Haul up all your petty desires

Leave them lying down before
Wash away the rusty disease
Of your brown town days in our silver sea
Leave it dying at the door
Feather yellow your time to leave
Open out your arms and breathe

Can I believe you're taking my heart to pieces?

Ah, it'll take a little time
Might take a little crime to come undone

Hey child, stay wilder than the wind and blow me in to cry

Can I believe you're taking my heart to pieces?

Scrape your fingers down my back

When you come and turn it up higher

If I stay, oh, the end is near
Come and get me out of here
Come and get me now.

Spare me from your torture baby

Duran Duran,"God created the world
Then created the devil to blame for his mistakes
I closed the door of my hotel room behind me
It was like closing a chapter in the book of life
Outside 30 floors below I could hear the police
Using their sirens like wolf whistles to pick up young girls
On TV Oliver North his 15 minutes of fame
Ticking steadily away was being fuzzy about crucial events
Which had happened a year earlier- what a flake
But then who isn't
That was Reagan's defense at least
The worst thing is how politics begins to leak into your life
Back in our innocence we used to simply stick two fingers up
Say ""fuck off"" that was about all you had to say anyway
And then go back to the more important business of making music
So why was I sitting there feeling angry about covert operations
And illegal aid to the contras
I mean I'm not even American
But maybe we all are a little bit
And then I realized it was just the thought
That in this particular democracy
And probably every other one in the world
There is somebody in power who thinks he is more right
Then all the people who put him there
All the people who for once in their lives took an interest
Outside the wind was howling the who-who's
From sympathy for the devil
Round and round the concrete hotel walls and corners
That was then- this isn't",God (London)
Duran Duran,"Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality

Because I'm easy come, easy go
A little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooo
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooo (anyway the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo Figaro - magnifico

But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity

For me
For me

So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh baby can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here

Nothing really matters nothing really matters to me

Concrete beach to scrape my head
Inside the subway stinking fear and shame
Becomes the violent breath

This is where it ends

Nothing to protest
Learn to love your anger now
Anger here is all you possess
Welcome to the edge

To cover fear and loathing
With a pink disguise

Put a stripe on the union, and a star on the jack

She's on the evening news

You may not like it
You may not be scared,

But, as I waled on, I realized I was going up.

Somebody whistled behind and turning round
They seemed far below.
Then I came to where there had been a fire
And was shaded
From the sun by the trees.
Figure of eight, it's our year, it always was.

Duran Duran,"Hey guys, turn it up to get sleazy, twist it in a vise.
Nobody said it was easy, just use your naked eyes. (oh)
How to see and how to hide it,
How to save it well...
Maybe, maybe, maybe
You could take it and eat it
Chew your life supply (oh)
Where's the real life, in your illusion
On the dark side - your powers and confusion
Do the dance,
Do the demolition
And lose the chance to hear when you don't listen

Don't you feel edgy?
Bite your lips and bleed.
Conversation is empty,
Abandoned in the freeze.
Freedom is the only condemnation
Free to say well..
Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe -
You can take it or leave it,
Just need a little hit tonight.
Where's the real life, in your illusion
On the dark side - of power and confusion
Do the dance,
Do (do) the demolition.
And lose the chance to hear 'cos you don't listen
Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe
You could try to believe it,
Just need a little help tonight.
Where's the real life, in your illusion
On the dark side - of power and confusion
Do the dance,
Do the demolition.
And lose the chance to hear when you don't listen
Where's the real life, in your illusion
On the dark side - of power and confusion
Do the dance,
Do the demolition.
And lose the chance to hear when you don't listen
Hear it when you listen..
You can't hear when you don't listen..
Hear it when you listen..
You can't hear if you don't listen..

All along your water babe

When you come and turn it up, higher every time
If I stay , oh the end is near
Come and get me out of here
Come and get me now

Do you ever wonder?
About the days when we were straight

But daddy got the hunger
So much to hide
We learned to lie

So watch yourself in the hallway

Cause we're all afraid of each other
We're the victims in this show

When we were straight?

Hard to my face and cold on my shoulder
And why has my life gone astray
Scarred by disgrace, I know that its over

Because I'm falling down
With people standing round
But before I hit the ground
Is there time
Could I find someone out there to help me?

Howl at the wind rushing past my lonely head
Caught inside its own motion
How I wish it was somebody else instead

Howling at all this corrosion

Why did the luck run dry
Laugh in my face, so pleased to desert me
Why do the cruel barbs fly?
Now when disgrace can no longer hurt me

Because I'm falling down
With people standing round
But before I hit the ground
Is there time
Could I find someone out there to help me?

Is rolling closer
Lighting up this holy smoker
And if this drinking
Could ease the thinking
I toast to my home truth with this glass

All rise you promises broken
Call my lovers by their names
Lost hearts and words
That are spoken to the wind
Which blows before the rain

Little pin-pricks
And how my ears bleed
On the bomb ticks that is my heartbeat
In every life-flash
In every car crash
I hear the silence waiting to fall

All rise you promises broken
Call my lovers by their names
Lost hearts and words
That are spoken to the wind
Which blows before the rain

For all I carry
Are murdered secrets
The price of my blue
Star-eyed weakness
And so we travel
And we unravel
Towards the place
Where all loose ends go

All rise you promises broken
Call my lovers by their names
Lost hearts and words
That are spoken to the wind
Which blows before the rain",Before the Rain

I'm out on the dunes
Looking for a token
Something to prove
All I remember
Is more than a flame
In my fantasy fire

Whatever I've done to receive
Whatever I need to redeem
Whatever you say
Even if I wait a lifetime

I know, I swear
If you leave a light on
If you leave a light on for me
I'll come there
You can leave a light on for me

In comes the morning
I'm stood in my track
Looking at the reasons
For me to head back
So unexpected
The kindness you've shown
That I will not forget it

Whatever I've done to receive
Whatever I need to redeem
Whatever you say
Even if I wait a lifetime

I know, I swear
If you leave a light on
If you leave a light on for me
I'll come there
You can leave a light on for me

You breathe the will into the weak
And coax the cage bird to fly free
You ease the lost cause out of me
With your sweet hand to bring me home
I'm not alone

I know, I swear
If you leave a light on
If you leave a light on for me
I'll come there

I'm longing for the dark 
Of our nocturnal life
It begins and ends with you
Don't spill my secret

You were once running wild hiding in the morning mist
Game in bonds - I make you mine
I thought that I could resist
But the leopard in you, silently, preyed on me

I made my way back home (did you follow her)
I handled her with care (quiet and controlled)
So elegant and sleek (when I'm not afraid)
I need her to be near (does she belong to you?)
Don't spill my secret

[Chorus]

Deserted by my friends (don't they understand?)
She so much more than them (how could they compare?)
So now she's just for me (no one else can say)
I watch her while she sleeps? (for sure she naps on you)?
Don't spill my secret

(It's been quite a while)
(Since we were last outside can't lie I'll miss the chance)
(Now that we both partake can silence kill the cat?)

""Today a man was taken from his apartment 
On the New Jersey shore and arrested
Under suspicion of entrapment of a wild animal. 
Police, after forced entry, 
Discovered a caged leopard in the building! 
The fully grown feline was said
To be surprisingly domesticated? 
Before preparing her for relocation. 
A large crowd is gathered outside 
To watch the beautiful creature as a giant
Cage was lowered slowly onto the street by a crane. 
From here, the leopard 
Was transferred into the back of a truck 
For the journey ahead. A thoughtful
Onlooker said it's extraordinary to think 
That any human being could have
Lived so?silently? with such a dangerous animal. 
Police are saying the captive has simply befriended? 
The creature and barely left her side. 
It's alleged that he hunted her in the wild 
And expertly forged documents to facilitate 
Her illegal export to the United States of America. 
The incident has already created much controversy 
And is now likely to lead to a major international investigation 
Into the life of the man who stole a leopard.""",The Man Who Stole a Leopard

Duskfall,"Do not pity me, this useless being.
Do not save me, this frail being, infant in size.
So I broke the pact again and in so many different ways,
I chose to quit this act. On the very last of my days.

You long to cling to my soul, I´m not going anywhere,
I´ll leave you alone, you end this ride.
This sure was a bond of souls, I´m not going anywhere,
I´ll search for the whole, it´s your turn to end this ride.

Don´t you fear, do not compare,
all we feel - the life we have in here.
Can´t you see, you are burning me.
All I feel is the time that´s passing me.

Share your needle, share that disease,
share your pain with me, let it flow through me.
Never forgive me, never forget. Time stands still or so it seems,
I deserve this all, I know I deserve this fall.

Downright dreadful, yeah this is for real.
Give us a new dose cause this no longer works
Show us a new pose, yeah bend it until it hurts.

Demons by the dozen fill your dreams
Dead eyes staring frozen, or so it seems.
The dead in your closet enjoy their sleep

Duskfall,"We have too much of everything, drowning in this shit, can´t even deal with it.
We´ve gotten all too much, this life has been too easy, now humanity is decreasing.

The life you live will leave you scarred, 
A choice like yours won´t get you far, crack cocaine and fancy cars.
A high so deep it changes you, not even the whites can help you through, 
Drag yourself down is what you do.

You rely on bastards on your side, you keep them close, 
They´ll suck you dry and keep the doors closed.
Here we are the bastard you and I, you kept us closed, 
We sucked you dry, let´s keep the doors closed.
Keep it shut!

Those city streets won´t keep you warm, drag you down and do you harm, see all your wealth wash away.

I am just water, I am nothing less.
Cold like stone

And nothin feels the same anymore,
tried so goddamn hard to please.
This was enough for you.
All that I had, here I lost myself,
here in this heavenly hell.

I am cold like stone, and thinking slow. Yes, I´m bleeding still
I am just water, I am nothin less, brushed away like ashes from the dust.

How can you think I feel free, you build these walls around me.
You still talk of love and peace.
How can you think I am at ease, can´t kill the man inside me.
I long for a sweet release.

And everything burned down, just so I could build it up again.
With a heavy load, with a stronger plan,
with a deeper thought, became a stronger man.

The ways we fail, it makes no difference.
Failure is failure, doesn´t it make sense?

Keep all things intact, stay quiet, do not react.
Die comparing what you´ve created.

Evolving of the extreme, becoming more insane.
Emerging from the shallow end, digging our own graves.
Just so I could build it up again.
With a heavy load, with a stronger plan,
with a deeper thought, became a stronger man.

Failure is failure, doesn´t it make sense?",The Shallow End
Duskfall,"A change was made today, somehow the reason got lost along the crooked way.
This so called peaceful state, where only wars are made,
remain still and enjoy the ride, right into your goddamn graves...

Seeking so desperatly for nothing at all, tasting every drop of rain.
Without daring to look, you´re turning every stone.
Generation cold and dead...

Move on in and let them forcefeed the weak, the divine gets them on their knees.
You preach about doomsday, you differ from me.
Shoot it in, this is what they seek, the divine gets them on their knees.
You give them hope, I just set them free - Your truth is not for me.

This so called peaceful state, where only wars are made.
Stand still, obey them now, remain without a single sound...

Fighting so violently for a useless cause, beating down the so called insane.

Duskfall,"Short were the days of the wise man, went up the hill and never came back.
A stubborn soul will fight anything, a restless soul won´t just settle in.
Left home in search for a paradise, found a place for parasites, like leaches they sucked him dry.
Numbed the pain, with bottles of whiskey... He'd become all empty

On that day, he went up that hill, couldn´t go on by remaining still.
Gave him some and took some more, made him their slave, became a whore.

There was no other choice for it to end, just to look at the bullet with a grin.
So won´t you stand and hail this institution, this is the enticement, your one last solution.

These were the days of the wise man, went up the hill and stumbled back.
Lost it all and everything, such a will to fly, they lured him in.

On that day, he went up that hill, couldn´t go on by remaining still.
Gave him some and took some more, made him their slave, became a whore.

There was no other choice for it to end, just to look at the bullet with a grin.

You can fight against but these walls will stand.
For every brick you take you´ll fight a wicked man.",A Stubborn Soul

Label me
Label me
Label me into what you want.

And leave their footprints in the sand 
Was the sound of distant drumming 
Just the fingers of your hand? 
Pictures hanging in a hallway 
Or the fragment of a song 
Half-remembered names and faces 
But to whom do they belong?

Were you suddenly aware 
That the autumn leaves were turning 
To the color of her hair?

Waits at the window, wearing the face 
That she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie, writing the words
Of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks
In the night when there's nobody there
What does he care

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people

And was buried along with her name

From his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?",Eleanor Rigby
Dustin Kensrue,"I've got a feeling, it's hard to explain
Feels like the devil rents a room in my brain
The things I'm ashamed of feel like dear old St. Paul
The things that I wanna do, I don't do at all

So bury me deep, cover me with snow
Wrap me in sleep, blanket of ghosts

Spirit is willing, but the flesh is so weak
I wanna kiss your lips, but I kissed your cheek
Hear my request, give this one on fair way
Please take me home before it's too late

Bury me deep, cover me with snow
Wrap me in sleep, blanket of ghosts

Wake me when it's spring time in heaven
The tears are all white from my face
Wake me when it's spring time in heaven
When I'm strong enough to walk in that place

So bury me deep, cover me with snow

I've got a needle, don't be alarmed
It shoots streams of lovely things into my arm
Well, I'd sell my own mother for that sweet heroin
Oh, now that I've tasted blood, now this wine seems too thin

Sometimes the white coats they hide black hearts
We've learned to sugar coat the same black guards
Well, I turn lead into gold, I'll cure original sin
Oh, now that I've tasted blood, now this wine seems too thin

Oh, well I walked in the bank and I pulled out my gun
You should've seen those people scream and run
I used to make an honest buck, how can I go back to that again?

Just keep prayin' that the check's in the mail

And I'm moaning, I'm tossed and I see

Between the river and the ravens I'm fit
Between oblivion and places I'm there
So Father give me faith, providence and grace
Between the river and the ravens I'm fit
Sweet deliver, oh You lift up my head
And lead me in Your way

I've grown sick and tired of trying to stand still
Time to let the wind pull me where it will
Throw myself into the will of the wait
I can never be great 'til we're free

Between the river and the ravens I'm fit
Between oblivion and places I'm there
So Father give me faith, providence and grace
Between the river and the ravens I'm fit

Although I'm walking through the valley of the shadow of death
Evil's all around, it's coming from the right and the left
Trust that I will see the glory above

Dustin Kensrue,"You were once a sweet little girl
So innocent and pure
Your eyes were open and sure
Anyone could look right in

And I followed closely your gaze
You looked up towards the sky
And I watched your face drift away
Other things had caught your eye

Oh, the magazines and media supplied you with their plastic protocol
Oh, and maybe music television really is the devil after all
But all I can say is I knew you before you were beautiful back then
Before you grew up, before you gave in

And you dream of sharing your heart
Instead you share your bed
And your heart beats empty and cold
With all the tears you have shed

And you dream of baring your soul
Instead you bare more skin
And you wear dark glasses to keep
Anyone from looking in

Oh, the magazines and media supplied you with their plastic protocol
Oh, and maybe music television really is the devil after all
But all I can say is I knew you before you were beautiful back then
Before you grew up, before you gave in

And all you want is to hear the words
""Dear baby I love you""
So you hike your skirt higher still
'Til their eyes are all on you

You drive in fast foreign cars
The color of your sin
And you tint your windows to keep
Anyone from looking in

Oh, and all I can say is I knew you before you were beautiful back then
Before you grew up, before you gave in
And all I can say is I knew you before you were beautiful back then
You could be beautiful again

Dustin Kensrue,"Love how you curse when I wake you up
Sweetly demand that I fill your cup
With the smile of your cool gunpowder glare
Honey, you lay me bare

You're the girl of my dreams
And a pistol it seems, but you shoot me straight and true
Time to lay down my bets
Oh, I put all my money on you

When I'm in the dark, girl, you bring me light
It seems like you're almost always right
So keep boxing my ears when I sew them shut
Baby, you sure are tough

You're the girl of my dreams
And a pistol it seems, but you shoot me straight and true
Time to lay down my fears
Honey, I feel so safe around you

If the tiller man taught me anything
It's that a hard headed woman is what I need
To help me to always do my best
Baby, my life is blessed

You're the girl of my dreams
Darling, please wear this ring
You're an angel through and through

Dustin Kensrue,"Well, I woke one morning, found you staring down at me
You said ""I'll take my share now, father please""
And you took your money and you took your leave
You drilled my heart and turned your back on me

And you hit the town and you hit the bottle hard
You race 'round in your fancy cars and you blow all your money
On brothels, beds, and bars
Before you know your broken times get hard

I still stand here waiting with my eyes fixed on the road
And I fight back tears and I wonder if you're ever coming home
Don't you know son that I love you
And I don't care where you've been, so please come home

And now you've hit bottom, all those open doors have shut
And you're hungry stomach's tied in knots
But I know what you're thinking, that you troubled me enough
Nothing could ever separate you from my love

I still stand here waiting, with my eyes fixed on the road
And I fight back tears and I wonder if you're ever coming home
Don't you know son that I love you
And I don't care where you've been
Yes and I'll be right here waiting, 'til you come around the bend

And I run to you and hold you close, won't let go again

Dustin Kensrue,"For years we fought the night
With pale and ghostly flames
Some still dream of light
So the sun will rise again

We'll cure our need for wrongs
In cool and measured crime
We'll learn to drift in palm
From our hearts and from our minds

Let us not be faithless
You will meet our needs
A good and gracious wordless
Will lamp unto our feet

For years we've closed our eyes
While rust on reason grows
Feed and clothe our lies
In our hearts we know, yeah, we know

Wisdom lends us all
Cool and steady hand
Steel pressed to my palm
Doesn't make me more a man

So courage for the givers
Do what must be done
To deal out truth and justice
With swift and sober guns

For years you met our thirst
Still deserts we have roamed
We'll be done with dust and dirt
When the ocean calls us home

And fall into the arms
Of a cool and sweet embrace
And under stars and waving palms
Shed our sin like snakes

But time will cease to stalk us
Death will be undone
We'll shine with the light of
A thousand blazing suns

Time will cease to stalk us
Death will be undone
We'll shine with the light of
A thousand blazing suns

His punishment has brought us peace
And crushed for our iniquities
He died to save his people from their sin

He was stricken, and though pierced for our transgressions
He did not lash out
But was silent, like a lamb led to the slaughter
So he opened not his mouth

The might of Yahweh stands revealed
And by his wounds we are all healed

He offered up his soul to death
He poured it out till none was left
He died but now shall rise and surely see

The many he has righteous made
And satisfied, his work surveyed
The man of sorrows evermore shall be

On high, exalted, lifted up

She cranks, she cranks, she cranks my tractor
She cranks, she cranks, she cranks my tractor

Burning the back roads, sucking jet fuel from the radio
Cows and corn field flying by
Gate's locked, hop the fence
Sneak past the barn where the riverbank bends
Shes the best skinny dipper that you're ever gonna find
She can hit the branch with her bra every time, and

I go fast, she hollers faster
She's the first one up the hayloft ladder
A girl like that's what a country boy's after
She cranks, she cranks, she cranks my tractor
She cranks, she cranks, she cranks my tractor

She's ten pounds of sugar in a five pound sack
A long straight away on a quarter mile track
She got a kiss that 'll hit you like a heart attack
I got the rifle she's got the rack and

I go fast, she hollers faster,
She's the first one up the hayloft ladder
A girl like that's what a country boy's after
She cranks, she cranks, she cranks my tractor

Dustin Lynch,"She was sittin' pretty close
I was getting warmer
She was all chery lips sippin' ice water
All I was thinkin'bout was faster, faster
Faster, faster
I was acting who cares
But my mind was scheming
How to get her starring in some
Nighttime dreaming
Making up true lies and getting her believing 
I was getting her believing
Sittin' on my truck seat
Sittin' on my porch swing
Didn't even care she was out of my league

I was sittin' pretty cool country boy
Looking big city
She was up for some down home back road nitty gritty
Hottest girl in the whole county sitting next to me
Sittin' pretty

Friday night full moon
Howling at the river
Looking for the heaven only love can deliver
All I was thinking 'bout was all I could give her

A Chicken with it's head cut off
I'm always on the go, I've got nothing to show
But a whole lotta nothing it's time I
Take a little time for me, yeah
I do believe

When life gets too tight it's time to unwind it
Kick back on the front porch with a cold one in my hand
I've had my nose on that work-a-day grindstone
Gonna get my chill on tonight and
Unwind, unwind, unwind it

Lightnin' bugs in the air like they ain't got a care
Man I could take some lessons from them
Think I'll call up my girl let the lest of the world
Keep spinning while We're laid back swinging
Back and forth in the hammock yeah
My baby knows it

Kick back on the front porch with a cold one in my hand
I've had my nose on that work-a-day grindstone

She waited for me to speak those three little words
I dragged out a promise that I never made good
She waited as long as she could, and now

Whiskey in my hand
Staring out the window
For one more second chance
Hoping headlights
Come pouring round the bend

For her forgiving voice to come across the phone
Saying baby wait
Up I'm coming home
But in the sunrise
I'm still all alone

I kept a six-pack stashed here back for us just in case
Our friends are all hooked up, laid back, passed out, or long gone

Park in the dark, where the road dead ends
With the trunk popped open and the music blowing out the JBLs
Just popping them tops, yeah we were shooting off like a shotgun shell saying

Beer before liquor, yeah you've never been sicker
Cops were pretty quick, yeah, but we were always quicker
Burning up the road 'til the tank ran dry
Just down home boys staying up all night

Fake ID, worn out boots
And they can't tell me nothing kind of attitude
Got a styrofoam cup, gonna fill it on up with a little bit of whiskey
Just talking that smack, gonna take it out back, who's coming with me?

Beer before liquor, yeah you've never been sicker
Find yourself a girl, get her number, maybe kiss her
Got a pack of Swishers, anybody got a light?
Just down home boys staying up all night

Whoa, yeah, whoa, yeah

Try to leave a little more than a mark on the blacktop

Dustin Lynch,"It's whispered from a tractor on a flat Midwestern plain
The fields are dry and dusty, there is no sign of rain
It floats out a kitchen window, somewhere in the south
If the river gets much higher, they'll float away no doubt
You can almost feel it in the air, an American prayer

They're gonna be alright, they're gonna carry on
Help from above will come back strong
I got faith in us, I got faith in Him
The clouds will part and the sun will shine again, amen

It echoes through the factories up in Michigan
It bounces off the levees, and rides out on the wind
Clear out to California, and back on up to Maine
It don't matter if you're rich or poor, a sinner or a saint
Every night, everybody, everywhere
Is praying their American prayer

They're gonna be alright, they're gonna carry on
Help from above will come back strong
I got faith in us, I got faith in Him
The clouds will part and the sun will shine again, amen

They're gonna be alright, they're gonna carry on

I don't know which way that you want me to go
Trying to look deep in your blue eyes
Do I lean on in or just leave it alone?

No map and I've got no lights
Wondering what kind of friends you wanna be
I'm wishing I could read your mind

Baby what you mean when you smile like that?
When you take my hat and turn it around
And you pull me close and you push me back
Look away and laugh, I can't figure out
If you want my kiss or if I'm reading too much into this
You playing with your pretty brown hair
I wanna go there, no it ain't fair
How you got me stuck out in the middle of nowhere

Do you want me like I want you?
Or is this just how you treat all the guys?
Are you a little tease or are you into me?
Is this is a game you play, oh, give me a sign

I guess they don't know, they're on the wrong road

Tell me, have I got you figured out?
Baby, ain't that what you're all about?
Do I make you wanna leave this crowd and head on outta here

Pulled on, court house, stop light blinking
Four wheels, corn fields, I know what you're thinking

Who'd wanna live in this place
Who'd wanna suffer the fate
Of a life spent pulling a plow through the dirt
Who'd wanna put down roots in a blue collar suit
We do, and a few of us know what it's worth
A little buckshot dot on a map it might be
But it's the world to me

I know these hollers and hills and fields down to every square inch
I know every name sprayed in Dupont paint on that bridge
Had my first kiss, learned to shift gears on these back roads
All that and all of this makes me one of those

Same man on Sunday morning as Saturday night
Barbed wire tough and cowboy cool
I'm gonna have a hell of a time trying to fill your daddy's boots

He was the first to hold your hand, the first to dry your tears
We had a man to man and now I'm taking it from here
I made him a promise, girl I promise you
I'll always do the best that I can do
I'm gonna have a hell of a time trying to fill your daddy's boots

They say there's things about him that you see in me
He's the kind of man I want to be
Got to give the man credit where credit is due
I'm gonna have a hell of a time trying to fill your daddy's boots

He was the first to hold your hand, the first to dry your tears
We had a man to man and now I'm taking it from here
I made him a promise, and girl I promise you
I'll always do the best that I can do
I'm gonna have a hell of a time trying to fill your daddy's boots

Girl you look so pretty in your wedding day white
Dancing with another man, oh but that's alright
The way he's spinning you around has stopped the whole room
I'm gonna have a hell of a time trying to fill your daddy's boots

Dusty 45's,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Dusty Drake,"I can read your mind judging me from your front porch
You say here comes trouble riding on a big iron horse
You're looking down on me, you think you got me figured out
'Cause my leather's too black and my Harley's too loud
You say it's a reflection of where I come from
But you don't know about me or the things I've done
You think I've got no values and I got no pride
But I ride to live and live to ride
'Till the day that I die

Short on cash
And I live my life just a little oo fast

Pierce my ear and I got a tattoo
Ain't nobody's business but my own

You see we ride for the veterans of the foreign wars
And we ride for the kids in the cancer wards
We ride for God and we ride for fun
And we stand alone ten million strong
So just because you go to church each and every Sunday
Well there ain't no guarantee you're gonna get to heaven someday
And don't be too sure that my fate is sealed
'Cause when the good Lord comes He's coming on two wheels
Riding chrome and steel

Dusty Drake,"Mama preached to me, boy be a kid just as long as you can
But I was hell-bent and bound and determined to be my old man
I was ready to drive and I wanted a job
Hungry to chase my dreams
Way back when I was twelve years old going on eighteen

Those four years of college I stretched into six and a half
If I woke up in time after parties you'd catch me in class
I moved back home, stayed out, slept in
'Til one Monday morning I heard Daddy scream
You're twenty-four years old boy, going on eighteen

[Chorus]
Hey all I'm dying to do is to live
Just tryin' to take what the day has to give
Everyone wants but they don't always get what's expected of me
They say act your age, don't break no mold
Be young when you're young and old when you're old
They say I'm in the prime of my life, hell if I know what that means
In the back of my mind I'm still going on eighteen

Got the wife, got the kids, got the job, got the cars and the house
In life's little rulebook it falls under ""all settled down""
But give a handful of friends a handful drinks
It's like riding a time machine
A bunch of thirty-something-year-old guys going on eighteen

Ain't no easy way to cross that river

And I just can't take a train
I just can't take the whistle or the wheels

And to this day, I just can't take a train

There's something 'bout those stations late at night
The way that silver arrow cuts a dawn horizon,
Just like a knife it reminds me of you 
And that night we broke through the ice

Colorado all aboard and you rolled out like a storm
Without goodbye

He said there are some things In this life that are out of our control
Like who we fall In love with and when it's time to go
She said, what about the plans we had
He said this connection's getting bad
Now come on baby, let me hear you smile, one last time

She said I would've loved you better, if only I'd known

He said, tell them daddy loves them and 
Be strong

There's so many things I need to say, I love you so much

She cried out, can you still hear me

As the pilot tried to pull out of the dive

Dusty Drake,"

Clock radio wakes me up from my dreams

This bathroom floor's feeling cold on my feet

But I keep the rhythm by brushing my teeth to the radio

The nest thing I knew, that toothbrush in my hand

Was a microphone and I was staring back

At ten thousand screaming fans through my radio

Back to Earth, off to work, that is the deal

I'm not a star, but I know how it feels to be on my radio

Well I pulled into work and heard ""Born To Be Wild""

I reached for the knob and I cranked it up loud

And I blasted that Harley straight on through the town on my radio

No, these aren't handlebars, it's just my steering wheel

And I'm not a rebel, but I know how it feels on my radio

Music carries hearts away

Turns then 'round and makes then stay

Proves there's nothing you can't do

And by itself, makes dreams come true

We pulled off the road just to talk for a while

I pulled her closer, then I saw her smile

Lit up by the soft amber light of the dial on my radio

And somehow the DJ knew just what to play

And the singer knew just what to say

To make her melt in my arms that way by the radio

Two innocent hearts and an automobile

I'm not a stud, but I know how it fels, thank God for that radio

I've learned how to love and I've learned about life

And I've done it all staring straight through the eyes of my radio

Dusty Drake,"My fondest memories didn't happen on sunny days
Cause when that summer sun was a-beating down
It was all work and no play
Daddy wasn't the only one who used to pray for rain
When the smell of a storm would fill the air
I'd put that farm in my rear view mirror
As the rain soaked the ground, it was too wet to plow

I'd drive down that muddy road, wipers barely keepin' up
She'd be waiting on the front porch, watching for my truck
We'd head for that old boxcar abandoned on the tracks
While they were riding out the weather back on the farm
There we were on a bed of straw
Breaking new ground, it was too wet to plow

And with the rhythm of the sound of the rain that was pounding
On that big steel door
Two lovers in the dark were learning by heart
What rainy days are for
Now when I hear thunder I still wonder
What she thinks about when it's too wet to plow

The strangest thing happened to me just the other day
I saw a storm from moving in, when my telephone rang
On the other end of the line was a voice I'd heard before
She said if you wanna know who this is talking
Meet down by the railroad crossing
Baby, look at those clouds, oh, it's too wet to plow

And with the rhythm of the sound of the rain that was pounding
On that big steel door
Two lovers in the dark were learning by heart
What rainy days are for
Now when I hear thunder I don't have to wonder

Oh, I was only twenty-four hours from Tulsa
Oh, only one day away from your arms
I saw the welcoming light
And stopped to rest for the night
 
And that is when I saw him
As I pulled in outside of a small hotel
He was there
And so I walked up to him
Asked where I could get something to eat 
And he showed me where
 
Oh, I was only twenty-four hours from Tulsa
Oh, only one day away from your arms
He took me to the cafe
And he asked me if I would stay
I said ""Okay""
 
Oh, I was only twenty-four hours from Tulsa
Oh, only one day away from your arms
The jukebox started to play
And nighttime turned into day
As we were dancing closely
All of a sudden I lost control as he held me tight
And then he kissed me, caressed me
Told me he would die before he would let me out of his arms

Dusty Springfield,"Yesterday when I was young
The taste of life was sweet
As rain upon my tongue
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game
The way the evening breeze
May tease the candle flame

The thousand dreams I dreamed
The splendid things I planned
I always built to last on weak and shifting sand
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of day
And only now I see how the time ran away

Yesterday when I was young
So many lovely songs were waiting to be sung
So many wild pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my eyes refused to see
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out
I never stopped to think what life was all about
And every conversation that I can now recall
Concerned itself with me and nothing else at all

The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit too quickly, quickly died
The friends I made all somehow seemed to slip away
And only now I'm left alone to end the play, yeah

Oh, yesterday when I was young
So many, many songs were waiting to be sung
So many wild pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my eyes refused to see
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue
The time has come for me to pay for yesterday

But two forgiving people

Dusty Springfield,"She's a great little housewife
Though sometimes she talks like a fool
But she helps at the store in the holiday rush
And she picks up the kids after school
And she puts down the 'phone
When her husband comes home
And she changes from mother to wife
'Til she feels the words hanging between them
And she hangs by her words to her life

She says
I swear I love my husband

Oh, there might have been time to be me for myself, for myself
So many things that she wishes
She don't even know what she's missing
And that's how she knows that she missed

She's a sweetheart except when she's moody
It's hard to get through to her then
Depressed for a while when the youngest was born
Ah, but that happens now and again
Ah, she might take a drink with the housework
Or when Michael's kept late at the shop
A martini or two before dinner
But she always knows when to stop

Now it's seldom, if ever, they go
Once you pay for the sitter, and parking the car
There's no money left for the show
She was doing the dishes
When a glass fell and broke on the tile
And she cut her wrist, quite by mistake
It was real touch and go for a while

You walk out on my life
Now, you're back again
And you think that nothing's changed
Denying superstitions, defying traditions
It seems like we've been through this before
Now, it's gonna be like starting all over again
Oh, baby, don't you know?
It's gonna be like starting all over again

I gotta get used to you
I gotta get used to you, again
I gotta get used to you
I got to get used to you, again

You know I love to feel you
Reach the depth of my heart
Deep inside of me
The way it used to do
I've had so many lovers
No-one could ever tame me
They all seem to rub me the wrong way
They always get my back up
No-one seems to do the things that you do for me
And now that you're back in my life again

I gotta get used to you

You're wondering where the little tears can be (can be)
Well, baby

I'm all cried out, I'm all cried out
All my little tears are all dried out, oh yeah
Now, that you say we're through
I'm all cried out over you

Last night I knew we were through (we're through)
It hurt 'cause I still loved you (loved you)
Went home and couldn't fall asleep (asleep)
'Cause sleep just won't come into eyes that weep (that weep)

Over you",All Cried Out
Dusty Springfield,"I tried so hard
All summer through
Not to think too much of you
But the more I try
The more I find
I just can't leave the past behind

Times that are happy
Are times that are few
And once I was happy
When I had you

The days have come and gone
Since you were here
Nights are twice as long
Without you near
Pictures on my mind
Stand out so clear
No matter where I am
Or what I do
My darling
All I see is you

You're there in every dream
I ever dream
There at every place
I've ever been
Everyday I find
You're in my heart
And on my mind
I close my eyes
But I'm not blind
I see you still
And when I throw my arms out wide
I find that you're not by my side
But one thing is for sure
Until I do
All I see is you

Everyday I find
You're in my heart
And on my mind
I close my eyes
But I'm not blind
I see you still, oh

I won't live again
'Til I'm with you
Oh, darling
I won't love again
Unless it's with you

So until the day
When you are back with me to stay
In every way
All I see is you",All I See Is You
Dusty Springfield,"I think I'm goin' back
To the things I learned so well in my youth
I think I'm returning to
Those days when I was young enough to know the truth

Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more coloring books
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time,
When I wasn't ashamed to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
And everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears
And live my days instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality,
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom's all we're lack
So catch me if you can
I'm goin' back",Goin' Back
Dusty Springfield,"It isn't the way that you look
And it isn't the way that you talk
It isn't the things that you say or do
Make me want you so

It is nothing to do with the wine
Or the music that's flooding my mind
But never before have I been so sure
You're the someone I dreamed I would find

It's the way you make me feel
The moment I am close to you
It's a feeling so unreal
Somehow I can't believe it's true
The pounding I feel in my heart
The hoping that we'll never part
I can't believe this is really happening to me

I close my eyes and count to ten
And when I open them you're still here
I close my eyes and count again
I can't believe it but you're still here

We were strangers a moment ago
With a few dreams but nothing to show
The world was a place with a frown on its face
And tomorrow was just, I don't know

But the way you make me feel
The moment I am close to you
Makes today seem so unreal
Somehow I can't believe it's true
Tomorrow, will you still be here?
Tomorrow will come but I fear
That what is happening to me is only a dream

I close my eyes and count to ten
And when I open them you're still here
I close my eyes and count again
I can't believe it but you're still here
I close my eyes and count to ten
And when I open them, you're still here",I Close My Eyes and Count to Ten

I'm so lonesome for you it's a crime
Going to the movie only makes me sad
Parties make me feel as bad

It doesn't matter where you go or what you do
I want to spend each moment of the day with you
Look what has happened with just one kiss
I never knew that I could be in love like this
It's crazy but it's true, I only want to be with you

You stopped and smiled at me
Asked me if I'd care to dance
I fell into your open arms

Dusty Springfield,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind

Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind

Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find
In the windmills of your mind",Windmills of Your Mind

You look my way
With innocent expression
Just as if to say
It would be easy

Forget for just one moment
Who we are tonight
I start
To weaken the music's strong
My conscience speaks, I know it's wrong

Give it up
Remember what you said
This kind of loving doesn't happen everyday
Give it up
That's the way it starts

Temptation makes a fool out of us all
 
I made my mind up
It had to end
So why this indecision?
When you're close again
Oh, the thought's appealing
I can't deny
With those old memories stealing
Back across my mind
I thought by now that the flame had gone
I realize that I'm still holding on
 
[Chorus]
 
I'll just keep holding on
It's easier said than done

This kind of loving doesn't happen everyday, no

I try to see where my soul's at now
Happy day is it further or nearer?
On the way, will I find it somehow?

And the river runs free

Broken hearts tear them all down

It's just the world turning around

Give us this night, oh

I tried to keep you from harm

That blows and chills me to the bone
Here by the fireside
Even the heat can't keep me warm
 
I'm haunted by your troubled soul
That rages out of control

Had to let you go

Out of darkness into light

Out of reason
Out of rhyme
Bits and pieces of your past
Cling like shadows to your heels
And your heart is learning fast
How it feels
 
With your secrets in your eyes
And your feelings in disguise
You come running in your fright
Seeking shelter from the night
And you search each passing face
For a sign someone could care
But they rush by in their race 
To nowhere
 
And you watch and wonder where you belong
And the crowd, it moves and takes you along
And the colors splash and repaint your sky
And reality is yours to deny
And you look for someone your arms can hold
Who will let you tell what begs to be told
Then you ask yourself what good are your dreams?
In a world where nothing is what it seems
 
Bits and pieces of your past
Chill your soul like winter rain
But the time will come at last
When a love will ease your pain
If you let me I will try
If you let me I'll be near 
If you let me when you cry
I will hear
 
Oh, oh and you watch and wonder where you belong
And the crowd, it moves and takes you along
And the colors splash and repaint your sky
And reality is yours to deny
And you look for someone your arms can hold
Who will let you tell what begs to be told
And you ask yourself what good are your dreams?
In a world where nothing is what it seems
 
And you watch and wonder where you belong
And the crowd, it moves and takes you along
And the colors splash and repaint your sky
And reality is yours to deny
And you look for someone that your arms can hold
Who will let you",Bits and Pieces
Dusty Springfield,"This is my same old coat
And my same old shoes
I was the same old me
With the same old blues
And then you touched my life
Just by holding my hand
And oh I look in the mirror and see
Brand new girl, I got a brand new voice
A brand new smile
Since I found you
I've got a brand new style

Just because of you boy
Just because of you
Just because of you boy
Just because of you

I've got the same old friends
They got the same old sins
I tell the same old jokes
Get the same old grins
But now the joke's on you
And the laughter does too
Every day of my life
As as fresh as morning dew

Just because of you boy
Just because of you
Just because of you boy
Just because of you

Just because of you boy
Just because of you

I go to the same old places
To see the same old faces
Look at the same old skies
See them all with brand new lives",A Brand New Me
Dusty Springfield,"You've been cryin'
Your face is a mess
Come in baby
You can dry the tears on my dress
She's hurt you again
I can tell
Oh, I know that look so well

Don't be shy
You've been here before
Pull your shoes off, lie down
And I will lock the door

And no-one has to know
You've come here again
Darling it will be
Like it's always been before
Come on over here

Breakfast in bed
And a kiss or three
You don't have to say you love me
Breakfast in bed
Nothing need be said
Ain't no need

What's your hurry?
Please don't eat and run
You can let her wait, my darling
It's been so long
Since I've had you here
You will come again
Darling it will be
Like it's always been before
Hey child

Breakfast in bed
And a kiss or three
You don't have to say you love me
Breakfast in bed
Nothing need be said

Breakfast in bed
And a kiss or three
You don't have to say you love me
Breakfast in bed
Nothing need be said, yeah",Breakfast in Bed
