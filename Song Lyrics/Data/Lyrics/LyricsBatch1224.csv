The Hollies,"Riding along on a carousel, trying to catch up to you
Riding along on a carousel, will I catch up to you?

Horses chasing 'cause they're racing
So they ain't so far

On a carousel
On a carousel

Nearer and nearer by changing horses, 
Still so far away
People fighting for their places just get in my way
Soon you'll leave and then I'll lose you 
Still we're going 'round

On a carousel
On a carousel
'Round and round and round and round
round and round and round and round with you
Up, down, up, down, up, down, too

As she leaves, she drops the presents that she won before
Pulling ducks out of the water, got the highest score
Now's my chance and I must take it, a case of do-or-die

On a carousel
On a carousel
'Round and 'round and 'round and 'round
'Round and 'round and 'round and 'round with you
Up, down, up, down, up, down, too

Riding along on a carousel, trying to catch up to you
Riding along on a carousel, will I catch up to you?

Now we take our ride together
No more chasing her

On a carousel
On a carousel
On a carousel
On a carousel
On a carousel",(On a Carousel
The Hollies,"Sandy the fireworks are hailin' over little Eden tonight
Forcin' a light into all those stony faces left stranded on this fourth of July
Down in town the circuit's full of switchblade lovers so fast, so shiny, so sharp
As the wizards play down on Pinball Way on the boardwalk way past dark
And the boys from the casino dance with their shirts open like Latin lovers on the shore
Chasin' all them silly New York virgins by the score

And Sandy, the aurora is risin' behind us
This pier lights our carnival life forever
Oh love me tonight for I may never see you again
Hey Sandy girl

My, my baby
Now the greasers, ah they tramp the streets or get busted for sleeping on the beach all night
Them boys in their high heels ah Sandy their skins are so white
And me I just got tired of hangin' in them dusty arcades bangin' them pleasure machines
Chasin' the factory girls underneath the boardwalk where they all promise to unsnap their jeans
And you know that tilt-a-whirl down on the south beach drag
I got on it last night and my shirt got caught
And they kept me spinnin' I didn't think I'd ever get off

Oh Sandy, the aurora is risin' behind us
This pier lights our carnival life on the water
laughin' 'neath the boardwalk, ah, with the boss's daughter
I remember Sandy girl, na, na, na, na, na baby

Sandy that waitress I was seeing lost her desire for me
I spoke with her last night, she said she won't set herself on fire for me anymore
She worked that joint under the boardwalk, she was always the girl you saw boppin' down the beach with the radio
The kids say last night she was dressed like a star in one of them cheap little seaside bars
And I saw her parked with lover boy out on the Kokomo
Did you hear the cops finally busted Madame Marie for tellin' fortunes better than they do
For me this boardwalk life is through, babe
You ought to quit this scene too

Sandy, the aurora is rising behind us
This pier lights our carnival life forever
Oh, love me tonight and I promise I'll love you forever
Oh, I mean it, Sandy, girl
My, my, my, my, my baby
Yeah, I promise, Sandy, girl
Sha, la, la, la, la, baby","4th July, Asbury Park (Sandy)"
The Hollies,"Shook my head out of dreams reality's calling
The early bird's been up all morning
But I've got no notion of moving from where I am
Though my legs won't move I feel disabled
I'm on a shelf an article labeled
Waiting for someone to fetch me from lost and found

I'm down, no one to hear me calling
I'm down, no one to see me falling
I'm down

Had my ways with days of sunshine
Life came easy, it all fell in line
But then again I didn't realize
When you're used to one thing it's hard to accept another
Like the woman who brought you up well
She ain't your mother
How do you cope with a thing like that

I'm down, no one to hear me calling
I'm down, no one to see me falling
I'm down

I always thought it was my dad who went to war
Thought it was my sister who fell off the wall
My pseudo brother Billy emigrated long ago
Someone went through' pain to have me
Someone I should know, I'm down

I'm down

To the folks who brought me up I'm not ungrateful
Kept the secret from me they thought it was shameful
It hurt me so to be the last one to know
Maybe someone's out there looking for me
Left on their own couldn't afford to clothe me
And I, I don't even know my real name

I'm down, no one to hear me calling
I'm down, no one to see me falling
I'm down, I'm down, I'm down",I'm Down [2003 Remastered Version]
The Hollies,"Raven hair and ruby lips
Sparks fly from her finger tips
Echoed voices in the night
She's a restless spirit on an endless flight

Woo hoo witchy woman, see how high she flies
Woo hoo witchy woman she got the moon in her eye

She held me spellbound in the night
Dancing shadows and firelight
Crazy laughter in another room
And she drove herself to madness with a silver spoon

Woo hoo witchy woman see how high she flies
Woo hoo witchy woman she got the moon in her eye

I know you want a lover, let me tell your brother
She's been sleeping in the Devil's bed
There's some rumors going round, someone's underground
She can rock you in the nighttime 'til your skin turns red

Woo hoo witchy woman, see how high she flies
Woo hoo witchy woman, she got the moon in her eye
",Witchy Woman
The Hollies,"Driving home I was miles away
When I thought that I saw your face
Late at night, a lightning flash
Put reality in it's place
I never saw the warning signs
'Til it was too late

I'm a casualty
A victim of my own circumstance
A casualty a hopeless case
I never stood a chance at all

I never knew what hit me
Like somebody put out the light
I was going crazy
Couldn't tell if it was day or night
I must have lost direction
A simple hit and run

I'm a casualty
A victim of my own circumstance
A casualty a hopeless case
I never stood a chance at all

Out of control on a one way street
Feeling myself beginning to slide
Out of my head too blind to see
That you were there just for the ride

Living a life, it's a tragedy
Why did this happen to me

I'm a casualty
A victim of my own circumstance
A casualty a hopeless case
That never stood a chance at all

I never stood a chance I'm a casualty
I never stood a chance I'm a casualty
I never stood a chance I'm a casualty",Casulty
The Hollies,"Picked up the phone called there's no one at home 
You said you'd be there for my call 
Did I do right by staying home tonight 
All I know is I'm so alone 

You made a date said you wouldn't be late 
That's when my hopes started to rise 
I didn't really know you 
You said ""I want to show you"" 
And I believed that look in your eyes 

Oh, well, you gotta give me life 
You gave me life 
You gotta give me life with that look in your eyes 

Oh, well, you gotta give me life 
You gave me life 
You gotta give me life with that look in your eyes 

Went out on the street just a chance we might meet 
The chance well it came to order 
I saw you standing there, baby, without a care 
Giving the same line to a guy on the corner 

Don't know your name 
Don't know your game 
It's such a shame, oh yeah 

Don't know your name

The Hollies,"With Mr. Soul or King Creole

Just hope people realise

The Hollies,"Is that the clown service I'm callin'?
I've made a fool of myself again
There's a hole in my pocket a patch on my pants
My shoes let in water I'm feeling you're here

Look up the smile service operator
I've got some frown lines that need to be read
I look in the mirror, I sigh all the time

Ooh, we lady, if I had my baby
I wouldn't be wastin' your time
Ooh we lady, if I had my baby
I wouldn't be blockin', blockin' your line

The Hollies,"Every day, it's getting closer
Going faster than a roller coaster
Love like yours will surely come my way

Every day, it's a getting faster
Everyone says go ahead and ask her
Love like yours will surely come my way

Every day seems a little a longer
Every way loves a little stronger

The Hollies,"If we speak of loving 
Will it come from our hearts?
Do we want this night of love to last forever?
Or do we just part? 

Listen to yourself 
Are you sure that's what you wanna say? 
We know that things sound different in the cold light of day 
Don't get dizzy and lose our heads on the merry go round 
I don't wanna be taken for a ride 
Keep both feet on the ground 

When we wake up in the morning
Will there be anyone there? 
Whoever is the first one to rise 
Will be the one who cares? 

So let's close our eyes and go to sleep with a thought for the day 
Waiting for tomorrow, just to see if there's truth in what they say 
Let's say goodnight, you know goodbye is a hard word to say 
Hold me close, we've reached the end 
So let's drift on away with a thought for today 

I'm hoping, you're wishing
I'll stay by your side 
I'm wishing, you're hoping
That a flame doesn't die 

And if we speak of loving 
Will it come from our hearts? 
Do we want this night of love to last forever? 
Or do we just part?

When all the boys move on

When every race is run

Blown by the desert breeze
No memory of trees
No mercy from the sky
No avenue to try

That much is true
But even then I knew I'd find a much better place
Either with or without you

The five years we have had have been such good times
I still love you
But now I think it's time I live my life on my own
I guess it's just what I must do

Don't, don't you want me?
You know I can't believe it
When I hear that you won't see me
Don't, don't you want me?
You know I don't believe you
When you say that you don't need me
It's much to late to find
When you think you've changed your mind
You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry
Don't you want me, baby?
Don't you want me, oh?
Don't you want me, baby?
Don't you want me, oh?

Don't you want me, baby?
Don't you want me, oh?

The moors stretch out along the way
By glow of night, by light of day

Reminding us of home not far behind
Careering through the path of least resistance

In wintertime

It seemed to wipe away the years
Her face was older, just a little rough
But her eyes were still so clear

He drank his coffee and he hurried out
Across before she walked away
Then he approached her like a little child
Too scared for what he had to say

""Hello, Louise, Remember me?
Now should we part or stay awhile?
As if we were still lovers""

She took a moment just to recognize
The man she'd known so well before
And as he started to apologize
Lose any bitterness she bore

She gently put her finger on his lips
To let him know she understood
And with her suitcase standing on the floor
Embraced him like a lover would

He told Louise, ""You look so good
It's just you see, you make me feel
As if we were still lovers""

It's not always true that time heals all wounds
There are wounds that you don't wanna heal
The memories of something really good
Something truly real that you never found again

As if we were still lovers

And though they talked for just a little time
Before she said she had to go
He saw the meeting as a tiny sign
That told him all he had to know

And as she left, she gave that smile

There's snow upon the ground
It's good of you to visit me
I'm glad you came around
I don't know how you found me
I didn't let you know
I only moved to this address
About a week ago
I guess you think I ran out
But that's not true
Other people settle down
I never do
I always have to move on
Just have to go
I've often wondered why that is
I'd like to say but I just don't know

I guess you always wanted
Life on your own

Up here the summer's shorter
And winter's very cold
I'm looking forward to the peace
My lonely life will hold
I'm really glad you came here
Thank you for the talk
It's funny how my problem stopped
When we went for a walk
Standing here together
Means so much
I won't forget your confidence
I won't forget your touch
You know I'll come to see you

We'll always be a world apart
I'll travel on but I will be true

Boiled alive for some gods stocking

People don't forget this torture
Just because you call her mother
Doesn't mean that she's your better

He'll say carry on your slaughter
Who cares for the little children
You may slice with no conviction
Blind revenge on a blameless victim

The Human League,"And after such a blazing day
At last the breeze began to play
I drained my glass and turned to see
Her face she smiled she spoke to me
I told her my name I asked her the same
She said they call me sky
Sky
Said she is in danger maybe a stranger
Might know a place near by
And she talked and she smoked little more than a job
All the cares of my life went away on that day
In that room coming out of the gloom
And the gift that she gave follow me to the grave from on
Life goes on
Now you gone
Life goes on after sky
Life goes on after sky
So much can change without a sign
A twist of fate two worlds alight
The words get spoken all worlds were broken
The wind began to sign
The heat of daybreak the precious keepsake
Too soon the last goodbye
And the death in her eyes come enraged of the skies
For the day of my birth was the last day on earth
Like a boat in the night gets a moment of light
I could see what I've done what must be from now on
Life goes on 
Now you're gone 
Life goes on after sky

Ahhh sky

Program your head
Then you breed

Where's my sex and violence
Magnify and glorify

Some money for a daring escape
We'll find a ticket cheap

The city will be earth in a short while
If I'm not mistaken it's been in flames
You and I will escape to the seaside

There is a storm in the distance
The wind breathing warning of its imminence
There is a lighthouse five hundred yards down
You and I will be safe there

There is a girl who haunts that lighthouse
She saved me, I was swimming
So young I almost drowned
Under the water she sang a story
Of losing her lover
She calls a warning

Love, you are foolish, you're tired
Your sleeplessness makes you a liar
The city is burning
The ocean is turning
Our only chance is the lighthouse

Her lover was a sailor
She went and she waited there
The door locked from the outside
Lover never arrived so she sings there
Soft as a siren luring the ships off their course, how alarming

We went in, we climbed up and looked out
The door locked from the outside

Stretched you beneath the tree

My girlfriend blows a boozy good-bye kiss.
I see flying squirrels and nightmares of stigmata.
Then awakening to find my Trans-Am gone.
Still, I'm feeling pretty good about the future.
Yeah, everything is peaches but the cream.
I'm handcuffed to a fence in Mississippi,
Where things is always better than they seem.
Things is always better than they seem.
I see the guitar that my cousin played in prison,
Floating with the tv in the swimming pool.
I'm calling for the owner of the motel,
Then noticing the bloodstain on the door.
I'm reaching for the shoes under the bushes,
Just in time to hear the sirens sing.
I'm handcuffed to a fence in Mississippi,
Where things is always better than they seem.
Things is always better than they seem.
You know freedom's just a stupid superstition,
'cause life's a highway that you travel blind.
It's true that having fun's a terminal addiction.
What good is happiness, when it's just a state of mind?
For in the prison of perpetual emotion,
We're all shackled to the millstone of our dreams.
Me, I'm handcuffed to a fence in Mississippi,
Where things is always better than they seem.

I will tell you what I'll do...

That I'll never fear
Grit my teeth too hard

Putting scratches in my notebook
And waiting up until dawn
Humming this song back and forth

Drifting between sleep and waking
Your absence brought me to
Sick feelings filled me
Slowly remembering the bitterness of the final kiss,
Motionless
We never said goodbye
When we gave in, but we don't mind
If we never say goodbye,
There'll be no end, there'll be no end

Stream of consciousness
Leads me to drowning dreams
Looking up, you're colored baby-blue
The frustration of knowing what it's like to breathe you in,
Remember then, remember when you let me in
Hold on, hold on, we can be strong dig our fingers deep into each other

But I just want to tell them they don't know.
For as long as you're in love with me,
Our love will grow wider,
Deeper than any sea.
And of all the things that I want,
In this whole wide world, is
Just for you to say that you'll be my girl.
Wanting you, I'm so lonely and blue.
That's what love will do.",For Your Precious Love
The Impressions,"From nowhere through a caravan
Around the campfire light
A lovely woman in motion
With hair as dark as night
Her eyes were like that of a cat in the dark
That hypnotized me with love

She was a gypsy woman,
She was a gypsy woman

She danced around and round to a guitar melody
From the fire her face was all aglow
How she enchanted me
Oh, how I'd like to hold her near
And kiss and forever whisper in her ear

I love you, gypsy woman
I love you, gypsy woman

All through the caravan
She was dancing with all the men
Waiting for the rising sun
Everyone was having fun
I hate to see the lady go
Knowing she'll never know
That I love her, I love her

The Impressions,"Would you like to ride in my beautiful balloon?
Would you like to glide in my beautiful balloon?
We could float among the stars together, you and I

For we can fly, we can fly
Up, up and away
My beautiful, my beautiful balloon

The world's a nicer place in my beautiful balloon
It wears a nicer face in my beautiful balloon
We can sing a song and sail along the silver sky

For we can fly, we can fly
Up, up and away
My beautiful, my beautiful balloon

Suspended under a twilight canopy
We'll search the clouds for a star to guide us
If by some chance you find yourself loving me
We'll find a cloud to hid us, keep the moon beside us

Love is waiting there in my beautiful balloon
Way up in the air in my beautiful balloon
If you'll hold my hand we'll chase your dream across the sky
For we can fly, we can fly

I'm a-telling you, Oh I'm a-telling you

I got up, I go to work
I try real hard to do my job.
But before the day is done
I find out I done something wrong.

Chorus:
(I'm a-telling you, Oh I'm a-telling you
I'm a-telling you, Oh I'm a-telling you

And my nights are getting shorter
And my way gets softer
And my work gets harder.)

The little girl, she's feeling bad.
Little junior, he's got the blues
Says he needs a pair of baseball shoes.

I'm trying to make one dream come true
And maybe someday, Lord I'll find

I can't satisfy
You see I can't satisfy your love
I can't satisfy

I found out in time
What was on your mind
You never meant to stay
Did without me anyway

One of the chosen few
Did what you told me to
All you ever did was lie
I can't satisfy

So I can't satisfy your love
I can't satisfy

You seem so complete
So pretty and sweet
But never knew I'd know
Just which way you're going to

Sometimes I wonder why
Why do you make me cry
Why do the love inside
Swallows up all of my pride

And I can't satisfy your love
I can't satisfy
And I can't satisfy your love
I can't satisfy

You seem so complete
So pretty and sweet
But never knew I'd know
Just which way you're going to

Sometimes I wonder why
Why do you make me cry
Why do the love inside
Swallows all of my pride

And I can't satisfy your love
I can't satisfy
I can't satisfy your love
I can't satisfy

One of the chosen few
Did what you told me to
All you ever did was lie
I can't satisfy

And I can't satisfy your love
I can't satisfy
I can't satisfy your love
I can't satisfy

And I can't satisfy your love

The Impressions,"Day after day
Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Is in your eyes

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

It's on your face
A look that time can't erase

So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

Twas the thought of sweet May coming on.
The days are running so slow, my heart is aching to go,
And my feet surely itch for the road.

Mm the long hot summer.
Oh now the summer long.

I have been tied to this land since the day I was planned,
By the need to feed mmm my body and my mind;
Look you can work 'till you're grey, waste your whole life away;
What security then do you find?

Mm the long hot summer.
Oh now the summer long.

I don't have no one to cheat, don't have no one to beat,
You know, I just need some room to uncurl,
I don't have no aim in view, just some dreams to pursue,
As I wallow around in the world.


Things I must do places to see,
Things I must do, now I've nothing now to hold me here,
And I'll take the southward road.

Thinking of the girl that I might spend
The whole of my days with

Maybe someday she will come, come along, long

That was no good, the one she chose
Did not like the way her teeth grew

Maybe someday she will come, come along, long
Maybe someday she will come along

One fine day I took a walk down by the river
Fair maid did lie and she did sigh
As I stooped down to kiss her

Maybe someday she will come, come along, long
Maybe someday she will come along
Maybe someday she will come, come along, long
Maybe someday she will come along
