Small Brown Bike,"I've been outside for too long now,
I've seen the seasons come and go.
Could be today may be the day,
Tomorrow comes and I'll stay the same.
Don't know my place,never thought it'd be this way.
Can't change my face, never thought I'd see this change.
Too many times I've passed these doors,
I've seen them open just to close.
Now I'm searching for some new key.
Locked up, locked out it comes down on me.
Don't know my place,never thought it'd be this way.
Can't change my face, never thought I'd see this change.
I've come to see this change,
I've come to stay the same I'll stay until I'm old, unwind, release, unfold.

Small Brown Bike,"I'm picking and tuning, but I can't get in tune with myself.
Everything I do I end up thinking about you.
I'm scraping and crawling, I chose that road myself.
I slammed the door in my face, I want to fix it.
I don't know anything today make me numb my friend.
Twisting and tying knots makes it hard for me to breath.
I want to know something, untie the knots that bind.
I want to be strong my friend, I want to breath.
Tell me I'm wrong and I'm far from it, I can't loosen the grip.
Take your hands off my throat everything I do I end up thinking about you.
Give me broken glass instead of all the answers.
Sincerity runs strong through me, I'll hold onto it.
Won't you tell me and hold me, won't you tell me everything from the radio tonight.
I slept on the floor, just waiting screaming at myself, ""do you love her tonight?""



",In Tune
Small Brown Bike,"Cabin in the woods.
Where I feel isolation.
Where I feel separation from everything.
But my mind travels distances that my body can't make.
I find it hard to sleep with this oncoming dream, I recite, ""I see you.""
This room sinks below.
Underground tonight.
Is your room sinking too?
I lie in the hide away bed.
An attempt for the best to awake my sleeping life.
Death is contagious. Death is courageous.
The phone was crying tonight, but I can't answer its call.
(Wake up, wake up)
With a purpose to react to this loss of response. ""I'll find you.""

And I'm looked at, inspected, hated, accepted

Through the night and I'm leaving

It was a moonlit Sunday

Fluorescent waves in sight
As we were leaving Pier 13

Smalltown Poets,"Yesterday I lived for me
And I was so alone as I could be
Then I saw you and how you give yourself away
And I want to live for you today

I'll give, I'll hold nothing
I'll give and I'll hold nothing back

My love is a lot like me
Wanting nothing less than everything
But I know, you're the only love that's true
And only giving makes me close to you

My hands are open, so take what you see
And I'll keep nothing, hold nothing back from me

Smalltown Poets,"It's the choice of a lifetime & I'm almost sure
I will not live my life in between anymore
If I can't be certain of all that's in store
This far it feels so right
I will hold it up & hold it up to the light,
Hold it up to the light, hold it up to the light

The search for my future has brought me here
This is more than I'd hoped for, but sometimes I fear
That the choice I was made for will someday appear
And I'll be too late for that flight
So hold it up & hold it up to the light,
Hold it up to the light, hold it up to the light

I said God, will you bless this decision?
I'm scared. Is my life at stake?
But I know if you gave me a vision
Would I never have reason to use my faith?

Now as soon as I'm moving & my choice is good
This way comes through right where I prayed that it would
If I keep my eyes open and look where I should
Somehow all of the signs are in sight
If I hold up the light

It's too late & to be stopped at the crossroads
Each life here & each a possible way
But wait & and they all will be lost roads
Each path's growing shorter the longer I stay

I was dead with deciding & afraid to choose
I was mourning the loss of the choices I'd lose
But there's no choice at all if I don't make my move
And trust that the timing is right
I will hold it up hold it up to the light
Hold it up to the light, hold it up to the light.",Hold It up to the Light
Smalltown Poets,"There must be something else that all of this revolves around
I appear so small and barely make a sound
Still mysterious these frequencies they draw you out
Looking for some light, see what I'm all about

The rest of them are stars
The rest of them are stars
I'm a quasar

Passed constellations where so many wishes have been caught
There you can find me incubating thought
Did you get consolation from a diamond in the sky
Or did he let you down don't stop there tonight

The rest of them are stars, the rest of them are stars

Can they know for certain what I can become
I may let down a few or off and surprise some
And as the sun outshines it seems like I've disappeared
Yet there are these sounds anyone can hear

You'll find me, you'll find me moving fastly to illuminate
And brightly and brightly for the effort from so far away

From the rest of them, the rest of them

The rest of them are stars, the rest of them are stars
The rest of them are stars, the rest of them are stars

To the crimson perpetual tide
Kneel down on the shore
Be thirsty no more
Go under and be purified

Follow Christ to the holy mountain
Sinner sorry and wrecked by the fall
Cleanse your heart and your soul
In the fountain that flowed
For you and for me and for all

At the wonderful, tragic, mysterious tree
On that beautiful scandalous night you and me
Were atoned by His blood and forever washed white
On that beautiful, scandalous night

On the hillside, you were delivered
At the foot of the cross justified
And Your spirit restored
By the river that poured
From our blessed Savior's side

At the wonderful, tragic, mysterious tree
On that beautiful scandalous night you and me
Were atoned by His blood and forever washed white

Go on up to the mountain of mercy

And heart break you find
When you tried to catch up
Only to be left behind

When you made your choices
And they brought you here
Surprised by failure
Hope replaced by fear
Oh, oh, oh

When you've walked a hard mile
Will you walk one more
And you have no words
To say what you're looking for

Had your rules and broke them
Can't bear to see your own face
Now when justice accuses
You get a thirst for grace
Everlasting grace, everlasting

Life in Christ is now and ever
A new beginning
With mercy he renews

When your dreams all come true
And your life is full
Then you wake up to find
You can't ignore the pull

When your heart is broken
By a sacrifice
What you've known is dying
You get a taste for life

Everlasting life, everlasting

Life in Christ is now and ever
A new beginning
With mercy he renews

We begin in Christ today",A New Beginning

Your one and only, that's what she told me

So the ceiling is her ground
Sees her reflection

While she's walking upside down
But never what surrounds
She's walking upside down

She likes to have me by her side
I guess I look good over her shoulder
She thinks I'll take this all in stride
Immune to gravity, I can't seem to pull her closer

Sees her reflection

While she's walking upside down

How in the world can it keep from losing

Smash Mouth,"Neighbor called my landlord
She said that she was pissed
Up all night making noise
And she can't get no rest
She said we was running a flop house
Full of thieves and thugs
Musicians and hooligans and we were all on the drugs
So she got bent and raised the rent
Said it would only take one more
Phone call from my whiny neighbor

What's up with my neighbor
What's it gonna take to get a break
She's got us tiptoeing around in fear
Church mice at St Leos down my street
Have moved so far away
She has sent them packing and running scared
How much more does she think we will take

Maybe some day when I'm old and fat and bored
Ill understand why my neighbors making my life hell
I can't even watch TV or sneeze or fart can't even breathe
For fear my landlord will come and ring my bell
How much more does she think we will pay

No more flop house no more fun
I've got a whiny neighbor [Repeat x2]
Shooting cans with b.b. guns
I've got a whiny neighbor [Repeat x2]
She says these punks have to go
I think were gonna get the old heave ho

Neighbor called my landlord
It was a Sunday afternoon
She couldn't hear the TV set
We were having a BBQ
We were listening to Louis Prima
And drinking meisterbrau
If she would have come and talked it over
And she wasn't a lazy cow
So she got bent and raised the rent
Said it would only take one more
Phone call from my whiny neighbor

Maybe someday when I'm jaded
Nine to five at a job I hate
Ill come home and razz my neighbors too
But id have clever strategy
And catch them when the rent is late
And all the other bills are overdue
After all this is the neighborly way

No more music no more fun
I've got a whiny neighbor [Repeat x2]
Barbecues in the sun
I've got a whiny neighbor [Repeat x2]
She says that these punks must go
I think were gonna get the old heave ho

Don't even hide the dog
Or put the bong away
We don't want to live here anyway

Neighbor called my landlord
She said we didn't care
The lawn is dead
Dogs and cats are stinking everywhere
She said we had crazy parties every night
The yard is littered with bottles and cans
Skateboards and bikes
She didn't get bent
Didn't raise the rent
We only got a note that read
In thirty days well get the old heave ho

No more flop house no more fun

You can be the rook or the pawn 
But if you have the strategy that's best 
You can be the King or in this case the Don

You've got to have eyes on the back of your head

I'm a man of respect and I prefer to be addressed as Padrino

You could be a stone in someone's shoe 
You'll receive a kiss on each cheek 
And then you'll know that pretty soon the stone will be removed

It doesn't pay the taxes away 
You've got to be slick if you don't want it to stick 
Now that we have that out of the way 

I know it's not a wise thing to do 
Writing funny songs about the mob 
But if it's all the same to you 
I don't see it as a gang but a club 
Where men sit like gentlemen 
Plotting their events about 
Things I shouldn't understand, comprehend or care 
Like, oh, I don't know maybe I shouldn't go there 
After all it is a family affair 

Stay out of the papers 
Don't get caught 
Leave the singing to Sinatra and always keep your big trap shut

It will surely bring you down, when you least expect it

Road man he says no go 
I've got to be the king of the road 
Road man didn't see the train man 
Until it was too late to slow the van 
Meanwhile the band is waiting for the Road man 
Who was crushed by his beloved sound system

I see you floating by me 
I see a beautiful face 
It's pointed straight up towards the smog 
I know I know you feel me beaming 
Can you sense my burning x ray vision 
As you roll on by now 
You must be gravitating 
To the vibe I'm generating or maybe not ­yet 
I have known you forever 
You pushed the reset button on the counter of my heart 
But you'll laugh at my advances 
But still I've gotta chance it as I watch your dust 
You do it You do it for me that's how I know that you are mine 
I send out to you 
Frequencies exceeding the speeding laws of sound 
I extend out to you 
The satellite that will orbit your mind until your down 
That's how I know that's how I know 
I'm the asteroid that will infiltrate your soul 
That's how I know that's how I know 
Speeding towards you burning out of control

To get out of this unscathed
Oh to be free and inhuman

From messy recipes of romance

Your face glowing in blue 
You smile at the thought 
That there's something out there

A million tiny light bulbs 
Shining through celluloid 
Across the country little green men 
Eyes shielded with a shaky hand 
The women screaming 
And the children gather and wonder 
Who's there who's there 
Fond of a night out in California 
It's late an interruption in space 
You smile could there be someone out there

The radio crackled voices 
With obvious and used excuses 
Blue gas burning above flicks and cartoons 
Bumper stickers in preparation for tomorrow

And what they're wearing down in Hollywood
I know she wants green tea ice cream
And just for fun melting in the sun
She likes her jokes as long as they're bad

But I'll never really know her
She told me all I really need to know
Is that she'll always get her way
And she'll always get away with it

She likes to take me out so I
Can watch her dance with her girlfriends
And the cool boys playin' pool stop and stare
At the way she moves

She likes to know that she will be driving me home
Because I'm too stoned

You'll see my game's on fire
But we don't play the same game

And neutral means nothing to me

But one thing: I like to lead

I light 'em up before the motor starts
I go so fast that I could never stop
Look under the hood but you don't know what I got
I'm a moving violation baby, hot hot hot hot

Highway, that's my scene
I may look like a blur when you see me
And I'm flirting with disaster, I'm the master of G's
Gonna pass ya, gonna pass ya, blast some dust your way

The windowpane to the soul
They will never let you down

Deep inside I know I'm sick and tired of it all
It comes too quick and goes too fast
Does anything ever last at all?

We're just looking for a wall to crash into
And me I'd be happy just bumping into you

Here I am and there they go
And if you ask me how I know
The oldest story in the world
Then I hope someday you'll know

That they'll never die if you never grieve
Everybody's moving to a place they gotta leave
So kill your TV and kill your phone
Be quiet and be alone with you

When technology solves apologies I will retire
With records and candles and pencils and cameras
And your soul in my eyes...",Looking for a Wall

I ought to better my best behavior
I can't deny I lit the fire
But the twist of fate bridge was gonna burn anyway

Without you, it's no fun
It's like a total eclipse of the sun
Without you it's no wonder
It's like a total eclipse of the sun

It's just that time of the season
I'm getting tongue-tied facing my demons
But I'm free 'cause I want you to be

And I don't know what we're going there for
No one's gonna talk to us, we'll look real silly
Staring at the gymnasium floor

I'll wrestle the beat
With my two left feet
They'll laugh and they'll stare
At what my mom made me wear
Tomorrow I'll wake up
Crying and smiling

It's just another day in the suburbs
Where behind every cloud there's a big ball of burning sunshine
Sometimes

Hitching a ride to the high school dance
And I don't know what we're going there for 
The girls are so pretty in their shopping mall fashions
And we're so invisible to them

I feel like I'm in 
Some John Hughes film
Like a dream we've all had
Where you can't run too fast
Tomorrow we'll wake up
Crying and smiling

Driving on up to the Hollywood party
I dunno what I'm going there for
There's too many fools and too many rules
And dress codes, and I'm one too many people there

Sharing 8 by 10's
They'll point and they'll laugh
At my photograph

Playing space man in your silver shoes

And what more could I say that I know you should know
Three little words are thrown around so much 
That after a while they begin to lose their touch

And you know that I should think of something better
Switch it around like I came up with something clever
Or maybe I should just shut up
'cause I got nothing but a whole lotta love

Could you be lovelier?

For you I'd take off my shoes and my socks baby
And watch you laugh as I walk across burning rocks
But then I couldn't chase you everywhere you go
And it's all about the chase, everybody knows

I'd like to think that you would never make me do this
But you know I'd do it if I had to prove it
I'd do it again and again, you know I'd dummy up
'cause I got nothing but a whole lotte love

Could you be lovelier?
Could I be luckier?
So why was I so dumb?
Maybe we're living on Mars
And Venus is too far
Now I got nothing but nothing to lose

Could you be lovelier? I don't know

They say that beauty never goes deeper than the skin

My eyes dance with fire
The thought of living here
And the bounds I transpire
Walking in this slow-motion now
I think you've made so bad 
Standing with your mannequin
I try to hold my breath 
The grave that bears my name
Started a dream
A dream, immortality
Yet I fall in vain 
Just as long as I don't breathe
I'll never be like them 
Standing with your mannequin
I try to hold my breath 
If you go and I would stay
And you would call my name
I would cry, yes, I would cry
Walking in or walking out
Is the same as talking about my heart

Wishing I was far away

On a live wire right up off the street
You and I should meet
June bug skipping like a stone
With the headlights pointed at the dawn

And I don't even care to shake these zipper blues
And we don't know just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed into the earth below

Double cross the vacant and the bored
They're not sure just what we have in the store
Morphine city slippin' dues, down to see that

We don't even care, as restless as we are
We feel the pull in the land of a thousand guilts
And poured cement, lamented and assured
To the lights and towns below
Faster than the speed of sound
Faster than we thought we'd go, beneath the sound of hope

Justine never knew the rules
Hung down with the freaks and the ghouls
No apologies ever need be made
I know you better than you fake it, to see

And I don't even care to shake these zipper blues

Adrift among the days

Blessed and cursed and won
Time heals but I'm forever broken
By and by the way
Have you ever heard the words
I'm singing in these songs?
It's for the girl I've loved all along
Can a taste of love be so wrong
As all things must surely have to end
And great loves will one day have to part
I know that I am meant for this world
And in my mind as I was floating
Far above the clouds
Some children laughed I'd fall for certain
For thinking that I'd last forever

But I knew exactly where I was
And I knew the meaning of it all
And I knew the distance to the sun
And I knew the echo that is love
And I knew the secrets in your spires
And I knew the emptiness of youth
And I knew the solitude of heart
And I knew the murmurs of the soul

And the world is drawn into your hands
And the world is etched upon your heart
And the world so hard to understand

You could tell I was no debutante
You asked me what's my pleasure
A movie or a measure?
I'll have a cup of tea and tell you of my dreaming
Dreaming is free
I don't want to live on charity
Pleasure's real or is it fantasy?
Reel to reel is living rarity

With raven hands she steals and staggers towards her man 
Still scorned by his demon

But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you

For every chemical 
You trade a piece of your soul 
With no return 
And who you think you know 
Doesn't know you at all 
Their drain is needless 

Someday we'll wave hello 
And wish we'd never waved goodbye 
To this romance 
We'll drink up every line 
And shoot up every word 
Till there's no more

Crashing down, my friends 
Only love 
Only love can win

It's almost over
In Detroit
On a Memphis train
Like you said it's
Down in the heat and the summer rain of
The automatic gauze of your memories
Down in the sleep at the airplane races
Try to hold on
To this heart
A little bit longer
Try to hold on
To this love aloud
Try to hold on
For this heart's
A little bit colder

Written around the dried out flowers
Here we are still trading places

A free world
Of clear division
For too long

With the Nashville tears

Down in the heat with the broken numbers
Down in the gaze of solemnity
Down in the way you've held together

To this heart
A little bit closer
Try to hold on
To this love aloud

To bust with pain
A heart goes blank

And I'm still trying to suss out what ima say. 
And if I do speak on something's if it's you 
Stone cup all that hates so here goes. 
Why is it that when some guy makes it outta a hood life
They're like; No we can't let ya. 
And allow five-oh to rape girls and compensate them 
Like David Bikem is so wrong and expect us working people 
To fund your wages for you to uphold the law, which is what exactly? 
That I really need to know. 'Til then I'll stare outta my window.

It's making me crazy I feel so alone. Why did you turn your back. 
Why did you go away? Cause you were my brother, and you should of stayed.

At the ceiling tryna clear my mind. 
I can't sleep with the shit that I've seen today. 
Seen a dude in the dairy get stabbed for change. 
Passed away. His parents wont pass the pain, 
And feel like you just came let the rain in. 
Feels like you just let it happen man 
Take away a kids life away just because he tagged, damn.

Back right before we see the end. Please tell me understand

Lost my brother, I gotta know.

Can't really explain to you but I gotta try. 
First I wanna know other things why you letting your little brother
Slang rocks out side who drops and do what ever. 
Do you really think's making it better 'cause what 
I see is a cold world living, your little sister known as a hood rat, 
But you can overlook that, proves to us all you wanna do is fit in. 
Why you lettin' your daddy abuse your children 
When they go school bruised they're making excuses. 
Why is the majority of friends that 
You have all gang affiliated, hurting the innocent.

All up in ya muthafuckin' grill, I be Steele
Comin' through wit my Wreckin Crew, so I reckon you keep it real
If not, I'm blowin' spots, on whoever be showin' glocks
And what nots, walkin' around fakin' mad rocks
The only Rock I know is B.I.G., wakin' up and I double
G-H, wit that nigga are-you-see-K
Better be ready to be jetty if you petty
'cause if it wasn't already said, we dangerous and deadly
You better recognize or recollect, I reck a set wit a
Tek, and we askin', we blastin'
Now from this you might think the Steele is trife
I earn my strife, 'cause I deal wit the real in life
And I reveal my knife, to cut you loose
I'm not ruthless, but you get the boots if you useless
'cause, time upon time, I find
If you remain blind, you get left behind
But we, see very clearly, so step up to the front
'cause this is where we, represent on the lovely
For you and get praise due to the father above me
'cause we ain't here to attack, or, when we take the backs off
The wack rappers that jack off
That's all that's it, strictly the bumpin shit
Niggas don't even know what they fuckin wit

[Chorus]",Cession at da Doghillee
Smif-N-Wessun,"This is the story of a place that we call home
Where the kids pack heat when it's time to roam
Everybody's on the scramble, life's a gamble
Hoppin' on the white horse, tryin' to get a handle
On the fast pace that we call the last race
Step wit' precaution when you enter this place
We got a spot on every block that makes ya dreams come true
Just come correct wit' the synapses or ya doo

Don't come cryin' broke, still tryin' to cop the dope
What parts of no, do not you understand bro
We can't afford to take shorts or be playing sports
Empires need to be built, mack 10's bought
Or even caught for them deceased ass hustlers
And we still got the pound for ya living muthafuckas
What goes around comes back to the roots
See you at the revolution and Crooklyn, true

We live in Brooklyn, baby
We try to make it, baby
We gonna make it, baby
We live in Brooklyn, baby

Another day, another dollar dead
Pigs rushin' the crib to catch a collar, now I'm fed
What the face now, me and my people's taste crown
Stayin' face down, while K-9's sniffs around
What they found was irrelevant, the weed 'cause
They was sent to represent and 'cause a ruckus amongst us
Now I got more pigs rushin' we, handcuffin' me
Takin' hold of we in the custody

For blushin' in, rasta boy restin' in peace
After going through the bullshit, we in release
To hit the streets, where the war still off for all of y'all
'cause they kept rule locked behind the wall
No time at all, no fake, no jacks
Perhaps when the gat spins, niggas won't even know what happen
I'll be glad when my man come home
'cause in the zone muthafuckas grab ya chrome

We live in Brooklyn, baby
We try to make it, baby
We gonna make it, baby
We live in Brooklyn, baby

The eye three time, as lead transpire
Currency change, change from yours to mine
Greenbacks talk bullshit, floats on water
Pager goin' off, call comin' from headquarters
I was told if the secret code appears
It means some bwoy want dead, prepare for warfare

Fuck the truth, we bringin' the noose for ya loose talk
So think smart, or rest in parts if ya do start
I fucks wit' the poor, so fuck being rich
Word is bond, there's a muthafuckin' war goin' on
Stand strong, on ya own two, mista

Or come confront the grim ripper
Black hoodie on, black dusty fatigues
Bloody red afro, puffin' on the black weed
(On three)
He lurks in the shadow, so when you sleep in the battle
That'll be, and tell ya punk lib to tattle

Salute to each and every hood label truth
Doin' what you gotta do to bring in the loot
Huh, the time has come for armageddion
Give nurture to your seeds, and load up ya guns, dunn

Now catchin' vibes that somethin' ain't right
Gettin' little hits, stomach fillin' up tight
Damn, these little nappy head cheap trait bastards
Run around town wit' the cronz trynna blast shit
Ain't nuthin' sweat like the dark streets of Bedstuy
Creepin' population, endin' up in C.I.

Take a ride through the Flat bush side
See the dread and he caught for support, hit me off wit the lye
Now slide, through the ville, death row, say hello
To the fam' that stick to K.I.M. that's planned
Toward the east, somethin's goin' on
So burn the buds, and all my people in Medina stay strong

We live in Brooklyn, baby
We try to make it, baby
We gonna make it, baby
We live in Brooklyn, baby

We live in Brooklyn, baby
We try to make it, baby
We gonna make it, baby
We live in Brooklyn, baby

We live in Brooklyn, baby
We try to make it, baby
We gonna make it, baby
We live in Brooklyn, baby",Home Sweet Home
Smif-N-Wessun,"Grab a hold of your heart and visualize it's a kickin'
A hollow point slug comin' outta black biscuit
You ain't just from death, we round to the corner, comin' quick
We method outta minds and just don't give a shit
God damn it, gun shots we bust from the clip
Wicked bad boy, snatch the burner on my hip
So feel ya hopes and get dead Mr. Buster
'Cause we ain't got love for none of y'all muthafuckas
Chief the black Bar Hard, to do a Rabbi
You're too leary to live, but you not wan' die
All these MC's wit they fancy names and games
I know from the heart, that them not mean a thing
Big up to all the real heads, wit the knuckle game
Rest in peace to all my niggas that was murdered and slain

All heads realize, recognize, Smif-N-Wessun on the rise
You better recognize, I'm beamin' each and every individual
Who listen to that voice in ya head when it be kickin' truth
The heads that represent around the way
Showin' and provin', keepin' it movin', until they break day
Realize what's before ya eyes
Then see if you see the same real as we
When I say Smif-N-Wessun, this is what I mean
Nothin' alive, of rid dreams could never come between
Original Clik, roll thru the thin
And when shit got thick, we still manage to stick
Doing crimes wit deceptagons, up inside of the times
Help me at times, and keep our minds organize
So our knees won't bend, for the enemy
Tek and me, crime partners til the end

From the heart of where it all started
Bucktown, Boot Camp representin' for all the dearly departed
Next, we comin' to speak to the real MC's
'Cause the weak MC's, will win the breeze
Smif-N-Wessun hold the remedy, runnin' wit' the Boot Camp
On the search for the enemy
And the crew happens to be amongst we
Fuck this, we bring them to court and serve justice

See me and my Clik got a thing going on
True to the game and the love makes us strong
For every day trials and tribulations
You try to stop us, get rocked by the nation
See my forefront of soldiers, ready to blow ya
Leave ya back broke and ya body slumped over
The war is on and the stakes is gettin' high
You kill 'em on dead, if them shit where them lie
It's the code of the streets, when you out wit ya peeps
Bumpin' on the beat, be on point for the sweeps
Pigs, harass that ass for the drug cash
Armageddon soon come keep the gun stash
But for the meanwhile, cess ease the stress
Takin' gun shots through the nose, through the chest
Bless the sense, that get me irie
And all praises due to all mighty

Before I go to bed, I take a L to the head
Reminisce over words that was once said
By my man, God rest his soul, I was told stand bold
When under pressure, don't fold
To my brother, my nigga Rambo, you know we love ya
I wish ya was around, to see us rip through the underground

Keep the bull, before I pull this here trigga, 
Cause you don't wanna tess me, when I'm tipsy off the liquor, 
Like a punk they call mcgirt, got his feelings hurt, 
Showed his true colors, had to yank up his skirt, 
Now he's in misery, tryin to cop a plea, 
Led to his head, from gun clapper number 3, 
See, lick off a shot you no dick rida, 
Lick a shot punani, not gun fire

Smif-N-Wessun,"Walkin' down the street, watchin' you, clockin' me
Could it be because I'm magnetic, yet it gives me a fuckin' headache
'cause it's pathetic when niggas jump on ya dick and sweat it
But it gets hectic, when I set it off, by sick jazz niggas pop stressin'
Smif-N-Wessun, from the corner of my red eyes, I peeped you
But you don't know, 'cause I rock my rag real low, move slow
'cause you might get moved on, can't even get my crews on
Without niggas puttin' they screws on, shit ain't cool son
'cause soon one day I feel I'm gonna have to lay somebody for real
A deal is, but Steele is strictly business
So when dick riders slide around, I dismiss shit
And get wit, Boot Camp Clik, how we flip shit
On the regular, forever stay on our own dick

Lick off a shot, you no dick rider
Lick off a shot, you twist up ganja
Lick off a shot, you no dick rider
Lick off a shot, you big money spender
Lick off a shot, you no dick rider
Lick off a shot, you no follower
Lick off a shot, you no dick rider
Lick off a shot, for Jah Rastafari

I'm pullin' you're coats to the side of the block, we've all been to
See them on the corner when you're lookin' out ya window
The dick riders, on Dick Riders Boulevard
You'se that large, and even got to look hard
You got a couple probably at the crib as we speak
In ninety now, ain't no woman town for the weak
Don't laugh though, stress'll make a nigga hurt somethin'
Precede to get some yard weed 'cause the dred is pumpin'
And as I approach and greetin' by my 'cause Roach
""What up, ya high ass nigga, yo, you're shits the dope!""
And then he just K.I.M., Keep It Moving, damn
And now here comes the dick riders screamin ""You da man""
Until I turn my back, bet to quick to grab the gat
The head dick rider said ""I know where he live at""
See that's what I'm talkin', suckin' dick while you're walkin'
Now you'se the target of the Boot Camp stalk kids

Lick off a shot, you no dick rider
Lick off a shot, you no cop blocker
Lick off a shot, you no dick rider
Lick off a shot, you do ganja hot seller
Lick off a shot, you no dick rider
Lick off a shot, for number 1 mama
Lick off a shot, you no dick rider
Lick off a shot, for the rebel winner

Aiyo Haktu (what up son?) You know money over there? (nah)
The one who wan stare over here like I'm tried scared
Me, or maybe check what I wear, see I represent lovely
For my Timb tree to my D-I-see-K, every day, all day, we stay read up
If you ride dicks, then shut up, keep it movin, 'cause
I'm fed up

You took the words right out my mouth, ST
Got niggas ridin' we, tryna' suck on these trees
Pockets full of lent, hummers browner than shit

Even though some I used ta run wit and smoke blunts wit 
Fuck the foreplay lets do shit the raw way 
Kill the he say she say check what we say 

I'm dwellin' in the cellar wit my niggas Heltah Skeltah 
Loadin' up the clips wit lyrics punks run for shelter

New plates same faces from the last joint 
Got my banger so when danger come Ill be on point 
In the parallel cell mad niggas flip 
Cause some think they're doin' dip just got his ass ripped 
Juveniles buck wild in this vicinity 
Keep an open eye cause now I sleep with the enemy 
(Watch ya back shorty!) 
Ready ta thump wit any chump without theirs 
Nobody move nobody gets blown from here ta rear 

Thinkin' of a way ta get even wit my P.O. 
Cause I knew the bitch dicked a nigga on the D-Lo 
Now behind bars where scars come in pairs 
Troopin' wit' my blowers in case these niggas wanna bring it here 
Flippin' on the bitch ass, got cash and commissary 
Cause I ain't goin' home ta never worry 
Another straight up ""No"" comin' from the board 
Keep my anger hidden til I'm back up in the ward 
Niggas know whats the word cause the grill is blank 
Once again its on sucka-type grab yo shank

Well I was taught two wrongs don't make a right 
But me and Ripper been real tight for awhile an everything's aight 
I got one in store for hardcore fanatics 
Bangin' from basement ta attic put static if ya got dramatics 
Who's the next up for heads, when my leads used up 
I'll use my baseball bats and you'll get bruised up 

Word Life my semi-automatic 
And static smokin' lyes more than a habit 
And our victims die tragic 
We stalk around like the beast out for prey 
Back in the island pullin' more jooks by the day 
Takin' loot wit my crimeys on the run from the coppers 
Boot Camp's on the map and ain't no way that you can stop us 

Get out my way nigga, I'm comin' through deep 
And my fleet packs heat 
Ain't nothin' sweet we play for keeps 
I got money on my mind and my hand on my nine 
Got ta get mine cause my life's on the line 
I roll with the Ripper and the Ripper rolls with me 
And my Brethren D to the O-G 

See we be hittin' up Boom spots a lot 
In the cipher gettin' high with the hoods on the block 
If you don't know me don't even come in my circle 
Fuck around and get me vexed then I'ma hurt you 
Bumba claat rude bwoy lick off ya nine 
As I hit you one time for ya fuckin' mind

And a left hook that'll cause ya jaw bone to shatter
Whose skilled enough to come test the weeded two
Titans from Bucktown, that'll burn through ya crew

None affect the mouth, watch ya lips and my boots do a French kiss
Puttin' an end to those who tend to get me aggravated

And I slap cats that come miss the stand backs

Never could I ever agree on
Cuttin' loose a lot of mic troops that I roll wit for eons
Be on ya tippy top or ya crisply crop
By them crooked cops or the local cop blockers on ya block

I watch my back when for delf
Some say the buzz, but I say the fuzz bad for my health
Huh, critics could get banged like did it

Comin' for ya, 3-2-1 nice to know ya
You wanted to pop junk
So now it's like a little Vigor
I outta floor ya

Pass it over here so I can get Irie-why we
Smoke so much brothas be askin'
Why the Originoo Gunn Clappaz keep on clappin

Shows get blown, hoes get thrown out the room
Plus napkins for nitwits that ride deez from now til noon
Now assume, position, punks pissin' dey pants
Caise lyrical skillz is makin' you feel

Still if-in-case you didn't know how we be livin
It's in, my nature to keep Robin like Givens
For real doe, bring your steel bro'
Kill or be killed jerk - you don't know

Time to stack papes do you got what it takes
Can you react when your life's at stake?
I rock the stripes of an M-P, pon my timb tree
And keep the Taurus for my enemies
Whenever he comes in the mist of this Boot Camp Clik
It gets realer so watch Steele serve justice
Thirty-two degrees freeze until
These MC's decide to relieve you of grievin'

On my way from out of state, I hit my block F-A-P
Wit my man Ruck and my man Rock S-T
Jus' left my man brown nose
Now we gotta sack of the black for the shows
Clothes, ain't really nuthin to me
But I stay wit my Timberland tree, and my

Straight from yardie like the one Robert Marley
You hardly ever saw me without a bag of that bomb weed
I wake up in the mornin' and chocolate's what starts it
Reachin' in my pocket for the roach to spark it

I'm steppin' in hotter this year
Wit my bredern dry-tear, my cousin wit no fear
So who, wanna come tess Top Dawg
They dig you out the ditch and then they take you to the morgue

Here's Misdemeanor, the crook wit the mouth full
Known for bein' live and rockin' those flava Timbos
Half pass Lincoln, clothes dead and stinkin'
Country bwoy got me just zonin' and thinkin'
Time to start stackin' on you crab ass snakes
Gotta move right, cause my rep's at stake
Call up my dawgs that's quick to bust
P.N.C. take it back to the dust

I love the teachers at my school
They teach me how to love
But best of all

I love the pills the doctor gives me
Don't talk
Shut up
Just refill me
'Cause I'm feeling kind of low today
And the pills will make it go away

My friends are great
All they do is talk
But have nothing to say
I love L.A.
The air is beautiful
And its sunny every day

I love the pills the doctor gives me
Don't talk
Shut up
Just refill me
'Cause I'm feeling kind of low today
And the pills will make it go away

Better off like this
Than to feel the real shit
This haze, this fog, this place
Twist the top
Give me another kiss

I love the pills the doctor gives me
Don't talk
Shut up
Just refill me
'Cause I'm feeling kind of low today
And the pills will make it go away

Go away!
Go away!",Refill Me

Don't remind me that there nothing to do
What do we expect from life
So fucking play your tea for two
So what if I'm scare, I don't wanna come out,
It like getting busy, getting fuck up at my house
What would you think of me then
Since your doing the same under your brother dent

And there nothing that I won't do
Just feel the vibe runs through my face
And there nothing I have to prove
Just another Saturday

I'm only pretending to care
I should listen to you because your trying to help
Who do you to say what fair
If your so fucking smart why can't you figure it out
I'm out of control; it was it said in the poll
I guess it just because there nothing else to do
So come and arrest me now
Wanna be like you, so show me how

And there nothing that I won't do
Just feel the vibe runs through my face
And there nothing I have to prove

There's nothing you can ever say to change my mind
I need to make this clear
These words they must be heard
I'm only me and I don't care if you don't like it

Say the right things all the time, I've heard it all before
And I don't need another asshole in my life right now
Try to be my everything, my everything and more
But everything in my life holds me down and keeps me bored

I knew that it was the last place I should be
I'm like a fly to the neon lights
A good buzz is the only thing I need

Pull up a stool, nothing to do
Except shot after shot, drink till I puke

And I'm standin' on the edge of what is real
I feel like I've drank away the better part of years
My fears have me pinned against a wall but without them
I would fall so, before I'm gone let's have a cheers

I've lived through some hard times
I've done the best I could with what I've had
Life is never a short flight
I'm still so young how did I get so

Pull up a stool, nothing to do
Except shot after shot, drink till I puke

Times are hard in the perma fade
I never see things right

It's on a cold table gettin' surgery
We doin' it again haters still pissed
Still mad over ""Who Wants This""
Deal with it Smilez always real with it (Uh-huh)
HDT be clear when I spit it
How you want it? East or West Coast style
Or Dirty South slowin' it down
Or thuggin' it out bustin' a pound (Uh)
Smilez goes both ways, pick your rail (Uh)

Smilez says Chorus

(Southstar)
Still want to play? I don't think so
I got no draws, only K.O's
Only homeruns, I never miss three's
What I'm sayin' is ya can't fuck with me (Hell no)
This won't take long it's a quick 'bout
Game over c'mon scream my name out (Southstar)
Raise my arm up call me the champ
You thought you was the man now you's a loyal fan

Yo, get your dring on, get your smoke on
Pop pills till' you fall out on the floor
I know your love strong, but he doing you wrong
Let that man next door hit it to the song

We keep it gully
We keep it gully
We keep it gully
Gully, gully, gully

I'm so grimey, I keep y'all behind me
Spit so raw I'll make y'all rewind me
Just to learn the song, just to rap along
I'm like Mills Lane, ready to get it on
I'ma prove a point, listen to the joint
Only hot shit, I don't ever disappoint
And even with that cheedar, I keep it so gutter
And even with the pressure, man I won't stutter
Yo this ain't no joke, I'll make ya speak in smoke
If ya get to close give ya a heat stroke
See it's my time, can't take the shine
And when I'm done with this they buildin' me a shrine
So in the meantime make this game mine
I got enough rhymes to last a lifetime
So I'ma keep goin' ain't no way of slowin' me down
Cause you know Southstar'll keep flowin'

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Smilez]
You know the flow sick, know this, Smilez focus
Drop sixteen and ya man's foldin'
Burpin' after I eat him for din-din
And look at his boys, they like I'm not with him
Yo Smilez keep it gully up in the Lex buggy
With ma rubbin' my tummy and suckin' babies from me
And girls real funny not understandin' my mack
I'm not Jordan, once I'm done with you there's no comin' back
Keep my hat tucked low anywhere I choose to go
want to meet my dough, first meet my fo-fo
Cause niggaz act sour when they around ya
But bullets like aliens, don't catch a close encounter
Rhymes you can bet, keep 'em fat nothin' less
Put this in ya face and you'll catch a cardiac arrest
Who cares how dope you is or who you rollin' with
You can't touch a hair on my chinny-chin chin, BITCH!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Smilez & Southstar]
Hey yo we straight out the O, O-Town, just so you know
It's mister Smi-dow and it's South-Stizzo
In the Lex and the Benz, and we comin through slow
Ridin' on dubs, chicks like there they go
With a pinwheel cap and a throwback jersey
Dude need to bring his youth back cause they mercky
Girls love Smilez he a freak Kirspy
And I got the whole world beggin' me mercy
Techs so raw y'all don't want no more
We in it to win it you know that's for sure
And this is just the begginin' we got more in store
We gon' kick in the door big style on you dog
We gon' buy out the mall, cause another storm
If they do cop another one and that's our law
And my words is bionic, y'all nigga don't want it
Have you red, white, and blue make you patriotic

Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me.

Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra,"When they begin the beguine 
It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""
And we suddenly know, what heaven we're in,
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine

All the color's washed away
I've had it now for more damn years
Than I can count anyway
I wear it beneath my jacket
With the collar turned up high
So old I should replace it
But I'm not about to try

This shirt's got silver buttons
And a place upon the sleeve
Where I used to set my heart up
Right there anyone could see
This shirt is the one I wore to every boring high school dance
Where the boys ignored the girls
And we all pretended to like the band

This shirt was a pillow for my head
On a train through Italy
This shirt was a blanket beneath the love
We made in Argeles
This shirt was lost for three whole days
In a town near Buffalo
'Till I found the locker key
In a downtown Trailways bus depot

This shirt was the one I lent you
And when you gave it back
There was a rip inside the sleeve
Where you rolled your cigarettes
It was the place I put my heart
Now look at where you put a tear
I forgave your thoughtlessness
But not the boy who put it there

This shirt was the place your cat
Decided to give birth to five
And we stayed up all night watching
And we wept when the last one died
This shirt is just an old faded piece of cotton
Shining like the memories
Inside those silver buttons

This shirt is a grand old relic
With a grand old history
I wear it now for Sunday chores
Cleaning house and raking leaves
I wear it beneath my jacket

The window to your soul 
In the match am I your goal?
Because I feel you so
You follow me to my dreams 
And to my pillow seams
In the night I heard each and every word

It's amazing the way myself responds
To the slightest touch you give me
It's so hard for you always 
And the place where I want to be is inside you

I dream I dream I dream
I dream I dream I dream
I dream I dream I dream

Mesmerized by your eyes
What secrets do you keep?
The language that you speak
Torments me in my sleep

It's amazing the way myself responds
To the slightest touch you give me
It's so hard for you always 
And the place where I want to be is inside you

Your beau-ti-ful eyes I see you-and-your beauty inside
The touch of your voice,
I take it all, hear you 
Talking in your language
Falling with the touch of you
Fully find my heart now
To wander by your big old
Tree-because

We make our way up on a warm breeze
Down mimosa street across the avenue
I hear a voice that's calling me to sing as one - ah

Brave the waters and see when it happens
Life can be sweet, life can be hmmm
If you just
So la ti do for joy and sorrow
Wouldn't it be nice to have you
We fall in love in tears and laughter
Yes it would be nice to have you
Way beyond and way
Before tomorrow

Now its early march and you're still here with me
Warm in my heart and we are free to be as one
Won't you sing it with me?

You took me off where I left it
Guessing and wandering what I did
All through the night and we drift a little

I knew you before 
I think you're with me, I'm not sure
Didn't know what it was
Don't you know who I am 
'Cause I don't know myself anymore
'Cause I didn't know what it was before 
I didn't what it was

What it is or what it was
You took me in when I got off
Forever keeping me just a bit
Back in a way that still tilts a little

I know you before, a feeling, a motion a wave
I look at you now and question the future

And spirits high 
I'm singing, with your smile on my mouth
In the air you float above my house

YouÂ´re everywhere
I have no choice but to climb you with my voice
You make me breathless with your tenderness
I fly

You are in the air
You are on my skin
You are everything

So pleased that you exists
With this song you bring a tender kiss
Can't come down for a while
Your warmth is a very nice glow
HeartÂ´s thumping like a bell in a church
Makes me climb on the furniture
I fly

You are in the air
You are on my skin
You are everything
Falling under the spell of loving you

And as the solar star in me
Has fixed my constant star on thee
The once fierce we will find

Leopards, tigers become kinder
Falling in the air of loving you
Falling in the air of loving you",This Song
Smoke DZA,"All my smokers get high with me, just Marley & me
Is smoking on your Kush, or the Sour D (Light it!)
Jus' come ride with me
Now salute eh yo
While you puff 'til your eyes get low
Now salute ooh
To all my potheads across the globe

I roll up something, nah I don't fuck with the drink
Would have wrote this verse down, but I'm too high to think
Pupils is pink
Like my nigga Spitta, I'm too fly to sink
Devin, light the stink
Let's go, I'll smoke a zone playing P3
My nigga Shiest got that E.T.,
Got a nigga sleepy, yah
I used to coast down posts
Lookin' real nonchalant
This sale, off the Audemar
You go to coppin', don't get more than one!
I go to coppin', and they throw me somethin'
It's like that
This for my piss-test failures who won't leave it alone
Shout out to Ricky Williams and Pacman Jones c'mon

All my smokers get high with me, just Marley & me
Is smoking on your Kush, or the Sour D (Light it!)
Jus' come ride with me
Now salute eh yo
While you puff 'til your eyes get low
Now salute ooh
To all my potheads across the globe

Even before I get my pad and my pen
I must have my weed, I grab my bag, then dig in
Mix my shit together so that it's all different kinds of flavors
They think I'm baking pies to distribute to the neighbors, no
I'm smoking weed, that tastes like, kinda cake-like
Bud is getting better, but the price is starting
To skyrocket, so I said fuck it, bought an Aerogarden
So I can get high, smoke big, and break even
No longer have to wait for harvest season
For strictly smoking, why do I have to push
Sitting back with a fat sack of pineapple kush
I wish a motherfucker would try to take my weed
So I take it and I stash the shit, so no one can see
Then I make it safe grab a brew to equalize it
Every day I'm smoking weed, I'm hoping soon they'll legalize it

All my smokers get high with me, just Marley & me
Is smoking on your Kush, or the Sour D (Light it!)
Jus' come ride with me
Now salute eh yo
While you puff 'til your eyes get low
Now salute ooh
To all my potheads across the globe

The bud brownies that I ate just kicking in
I got my Jordan Number Eights, black, aqua, and grape
These niggas try'na duplicate the Pilot DNA
Copycats see the big dog comin' and run away
Bitches fall through at the crib and can't get up, they want to stay
I got your old lady in my '88 Z-28
Haze got her dazed, she's stuck, she don't know what to say
I have the best week ever every seven days
In the magazine pictures, so high I might fly off the page
Rap, smoke, fly, drive, do it all with grace
For the Kush, I got a Jones like Grace
I call my house first, cause first is my place, yeah

All my smokers get high with me, just Marley & me
Is smoking on your Kush, or the Sour D (Light it!)
Jus' come ride with me
Now salute eh yo
While you puff 'til your eyes get low
Now salute ooh
To all my potheads across the globe",Marley & Me [Remix]

Trains roar through my head
London churns like it wants me for dead

River do you see?
You're circling me
Angry waters that long for the sea

Oh I can feel it breathe inside
The devil in my mind
Oh I can feel it seeping in
The cold the city brings

Feet following feet
Through dark desolate streets
Thoughts collide like the light lines that bleed

Sky eerily bright
Plane trails through the night
Birds sing lost and confused by the light

Too far away to ever hurt me
He was alone, he was alone
He was alone in the valley

I went back down to my village
To bring them back the news of my wandering
It was too late, they had not escaped
And I was alone in the valley

Now in my dreams, I feel truly alone
Shots in my head and the crunching of bones
A scream to the hills, a scream to the hills
A scream to the dragon to take me",Dragon

I see five lanes of passing cars

Got a reason to treat you like I love you

Neon shapes from the bar
On shining rain drenched streets
Got blue light beneath my feet

Wish for endless darkness so I could hold on tight

And the only thing that stays is those morning blues
Oh my darling I can keep no one
And the only truth I know is in the morning you'll be gone

And the lonely beat
The drip of the tap
It's a welcome heart beat

And the branches ached out loud
Like they were screaming
All night the wind took hold
And shook this hollow house
And woke the demons
And I knew I wasn't right in the head

The letter hadn't come
The one you sent before you had to leave me
And I'm never going to know what it said

Some things are secrets people die with
Some things are secrets people die with

Broom dusters inside once more
Find out what you're breathing for

Dead branches in the distance
Your silhouette a shade
My primal fears awaken
You shout across the lake

Smokey River Boys,"I remember when I was a lad
Times were hard and things were bad
But there's a silver linin' inside every cloud
Just poor people that's all we were

Tryin' to make a livin' out of black land earth
But we'd get together in a family circle singin' loud

Daddy sang bass, Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
Singin' seems to help a troubled soul

One of these days and it won't be long
I'll rejoin them in a song
I'm gonna join the family circle at the throne

No, the circle won't be broken
Bye and bye, Lord, bye and bye
Daddy'll sing bass, Mama'll sing tenor
Me and little brother will join right in there
In the sky, Lord in the sky

Now I remember after work
Mama would call in all of us
You could hear us singin' for a country mile
Now little brother has done gone on

But I'll rejoin him in a song
We'll be together again up yonder in a little while

Daddy sang bass, Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
Singin' seems to help a troubled soul

One of these days and it won't be long
I'll rejoin them in a song
I'm gonna join the family circle at the throne

No, the circle won't be broken

I'd sail away to the west
I'd sail all around this whole wide world
To the girl, I love the best

If I had listened to what Mama said
I would not have been here today
A lyin' around this old jailhouse
Just weepin' my sweet life away

If I was on some foggy mountain top
I'd sail away to the west
I'd sail all around this whole wide world
To the girl, I love the best

She caused me to weep, she caused me to mourn
She caused me to leave my home
Oh, those lonesome pines and those good ol' times
I'm on my way back home

And my eye on a hog

Honey, let me be your salty dog

I pulled the trigger
And the gun went blam
And I got splattered
With bits of ham

Honey, let me be your salty dog
When God made a woman
He made her mighty funny
Made her lips taste just like honey

Honey, let me be your salty dog

I'm so glad the world's round like a ball
There's enough pretty women here for us all

That I held your hand little one
And I wouldn’t let you run

And your eyes asked a question ever so tenderly

Oh, who will take the blame?
Who's gonna bear the shame?
Right then, I knew, how it would always be
Put the blame, put it on me

You were a fine young thing
But I felt much older 'cause I had to shoulder
The trouble you'd bring

Like the time you pushed Sonny down
And she cried on me
With those same big eyes
You turned and you looked at me

Oh, who will take the blame?
Who's gonna bear the shame?
Right then, I knew, how it would always be
Put the blame, put it on me
Put it on me, put it on me

Now you're all grown up
And you're running wild
And they're so surprised
'Cause all along you seemed
Like such a sweet child

And there's nothing but bad news
From old friends I meet
How you've become
A woman of the street

And they give me a million
And one reasons why
But when I analyze it
I know where the real fault lies

Oh, who will take the blame?
Who's gonna bear the shame?
No doubt about it, oh, this time rightfully
Put the blame, put it on me.

Oh, who will take the blame?
Who's gonna bear the shame?
Put the blame, put it on me

Oh, who will take the blame?
Who's gonna bear the shame?
Put the blame

Even though the odds are high
We'll play them down
You may be a chance I need to take
And the hand I'm holdin' says it's no mistake

And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love

Fallin' in love with you
Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love with you

If this is luck then let it ride
If it's the stars
They're surely on my side
I've never been so satisfied
By love before
For all the times I've tried

These beginnings could mean more
Than the brief affair I bargained for
Little did I know when we began
That my time had come to win a hand

Happy is the way I'm feelin'
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love
With you
Fallin' in love with you
Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love with you

To be walking through a waking dream
Laughter never came so easily
There's a freedom here that's new to me

They tell me all about your heartbreak reputation.

I don't care about anything else but being with you, being with you.

People can change, they always do,
Haven't they noticed the changes in you?
Or can it be that like love I am blind,
Do I want it so much 'til it's all in my mind?
One thing I know for sure is really, really real,
I never felt before the way you make me feel.

I don't care what they think about me, and
I don't care what they say.

A few years ago on my birthday,
I had just become twenty-one (I remember).
I had a lot to live, said I had a lot to give,
Til a man comes to give me a gun.

If I'm bitter don't blame me.

Cause I'm out,
Pushin, right?

To seeing little hungry children in the ""Land of Plenty"".

To doing lots of deeds.
But never having any.

It's just my Soul responding,

I was born and raised in the ghetto,
On the run down side of the track.
And there are forces who do everything they can do,
To hold me back because my skin is black.

Oh, but more and more I mind!
Hell, It's about time!
It's just my Soul responding,
To being second-class in a land I helped to form
Just my Soul responding,

To too many roaches and not enough heat to keep my babies warm.

In just a matter of a few days, yea!

To see this cat do that monkey thing.

Smokey Robinson,"We were just kids playing in the rain
When you threw a stone
And you broke a window pane

You were so afraid of what you done
That I held your hand little one
And I wouldn't let you run

Then you turned to me
With a look of shame on your face
And your eyes asked a question ever so tenderly

Oh, who will take the blame?
Who's gonna bear the shame?
Right then, I knew, how it would always be
Put the blame, put it on me

Ooh, at the age of twelve
You were a fine young thing
But I felt much older 'cause I had to shoulder
The trouble you'd bring

Like the time you pushed Sonny down
And she cried on me
With those same big eyes
You turned and you looked at me

Oh, who will take the blame?
Who's gonna bear the shame?
Right then, I knew, how it would always be
Put the blame, put it on me
Put it on me, put it on me

Now you're all grown up
And you're running wild
And they're so surprised
'Cause all along you seemed
Like such a sweet child

And there's nothing but bad news
From old friends I meet
How you've become
A woman of the street

And they give me a million
And one reasons why
But when I analyze it
I know where the real fault lies

Oh, who will take the blame?
Who's gonna bear the shame?
No doubt about it, oh, this time rightfully
Put the blame, put it on me.

Oh, who will take the blame?

Or maybe it's your conversation

I pray that I might fall through
And hit rock bottom, soon to be forgotten
Like so many other people do

I need you to help me convince myself (oh-oh-oh, I love you)  
That besides me there's no-one else (oh-oh-oh, I love you)

Don't you know I a whole lot of shakin' in my heart since I met you

The guys I used to hang around with
Tell me that I've changed, that I'm acting kinda strange
But they don't realise that since I met you
My whole life has been rearranged
You make me feel kinda insecure
Cause my heart, I can no longer control
And you've got me knocking, jumping and stopping
Don't know which way I'm supposed to go

My heart is all tied up in knots (oh-oh-oh, I love you) 
I walk around daily in a state of shock (oh-oh-oh, I love you)

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

I hear voices all singing
But no one is there
It's a ghost of my life

Lokin' key inside me
From the freedom and sin

Smokie,"Rich girl she buys her dreams.
It's a rich world behind the scenes.
Green eyes they tell it all.
The more she takes the harder they fall.
She ain't easy and she ain't tough.
She's had it good, but then she's had it rough.
And I guess it don't come to much.
Cos with everything she's got she's never got enough.

[Chorus]
So she'll cry just a little for a few dollars more.
She'll lie just a little like she's done it before.
She'll take it, she'll fake it for a few dollars more.
She'll show you her heart, then show you the door.
You know she'll die just a little for a few dollars more.
Even fly just a little like she's done it before.
She'll take it, she'll fake it for a few dollars more.
She'll show you her heart, then show you the door.

Strange things can happen to you.
When you've got so much and you've got nothing to do.
Oh oh oh what do you know.
How do you get there when there's nowhere to go.
And so you wonder just what she'll do.
She's never known love but then she's never known you.
And it's too bad those sad green eyes.
Are so full of questions and so full of lies.

Smokie,"Juanita came to me last night and she cried over and over
Ooh, Daddy I love you you know and I think it's the moonlight
She looked so fine, well she looked alright and she moaned
Ooh, Daddy move over

Oh, baby you know what I like and I think it's the moonlight
Made in Mexico, schooled in France ooh la lovin'
She needed no teachin'
Oh man, I can say international ways, I believe in

Mexican girl, don't leave me alone
I gotta heart as big as a stone and I need you, believe me
To be here and love me tonight
Mexican girl, I want you to stay, you know my heart is
Longing to say that as long as I live I will always
Remember the one that I called my Mexican girl

Her skin was soft as the velvet sky
And her hair it shone in the moonlight
And as the music did play well the night turned to day
And I held her tight

Then she looked at me with her dark brown eyes and she
Whispered, ""Hasta La Vista!""
Well I don't know what it means but it sounded so good so
I kissed her

Mexican girl, don't leave me alone
I gotta heart as big as a stone and I need you, believe me
To be here and love me tonight
Mexican girl I want you to stay, you know my heart is
Longing to say that as long as I live I will always
Remember the one that I called my Mexican girl

And I was losin' when I saw you walkin' my way
So nonchalant I bet you get what you want
But so do I and I ain't losing' today

Well your hips were swinging
And your jeans were clinging
You were driving me out of my mind
On a hot afternoon when there's nothin' to do
You're not the sort of thing a fellow should find
          
So I pulled on over, you tossed your hair off your shoulder
As you turned and looked my way
Oh you would have died or you'd have skinned me alive
If I'd said what I wanted to say
So, being polite, said ""What you doin' tonight?""
You said ""Just so happens I'm free.""

I said ""Oh, baby, what's troublin' you?""

She said she'd give me loving and she said it would be free,
She told me she would call me or leave a message at the door,
And left me wondering what I was in for.

By the next time that I saw her I had clean forgot her name
And without her fancy make-up she just didn't look the same,
So I totally ignored her and she sadly turned away,
And through sympathy I told her she could stay.

Oh poor lady, midnight baby,
No one wants your love at all,
Oh poor lady, midnight baby,
Now you're heading for a fall,
And you really think your're something,
you know all the things to do
But poor lady, just a baby,
There's a hundred more like you.

Now for two weeks more she was at my door,
She would stay with me for days,
As a lover she was frightening in so many different ways,
But when it came to conversation she was totally absurd,
Oh she'd sit for hours and never say a word.

Oh poor lady, midnight baby,
No one wants your love at all,
Oh poor lady, midnight baby,
Now you're heading for a fall,
And you really think your're something,

But poor lady, just a baby,
There's a hundred more like you.

She spends her days in different ways, still trying to be hip,
And at night she'll find she'll lose her mind, at a club along the strip,
When her money goes she always knows she got something she can sell,
It's the one thing that she really can do well.

Of course you don't know what it means,

You blame it on your mis-spent youth,
You never seem to learn by your mistakes.

So don't talk to me of wild wild angels,
Wild wild angels on the skyways,
Those wild wild angels on the highways of your life,
'cause it's people like you who never knew,
What wild wild angels have to face.

And I ain't hangin' round to see,
You turn on someone else like me,
I'm still alive and you know the way I live,
But baby that's one way you'll never be,
Such simple things you fail to see,
You take back everything you ever give.

So don't talk to me of wild wild angels,

Like a firefly without a light
You were there like a slow torch burning
I was a key that could use a little turning

So tired that I couldn't even sleep
So many secrets I couldn't keep
Promised myself I wouldn't weep
One more promise I couldn't keep

It seems no one can help me now
I'm in too deep
There's no way out
This time I have really led myself astray

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Can you help me remember how to smile
Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
How on earth did I get so jaded
Life's mystery seems so faded

I can go where no one else can go
I know what no one else knows
Here I am just drownin' in the rain
With a ticket for a runaway train

Everything is cut and dry
Day and night, earth and sky
Somehow I just don't believe it

Bought a ticket for a runaway train
Like a madman laughin' at the rain
Little out of touch, little insane

Runaway train burnin' in my veins

Meanwhile I try to act so nonchalant

I can tell you
Times when innocence I'd trade for company
And children saw me crying
I thought I'd had my share of that

Are the longest
Midnight diamonds
Stud my heaven
Southward burning
Lie the jewels that eye my place
And the warm winds
That embrace me
Jst as surely kissed your face
Yeah these miss you nights

Are the longest
How I miss you

I'm not likely to tell
I'm a man and cold day light
Buys the pride I'd rather sell
All my secrets
Are wasted affair
You know them well
Thinking of my going

How to cut the thread
And leave it all behind
Looking windward for my compass
I take each day as it arrives

But these miss you nights
Are the longest
Lay down all thought of your surrender
It's only me who's killing time
Lay down all dreams and themes once remembered
It's just the same
This miss you game
Yeah these miss you nights
Are the longest

No matter what they do 
No matter what they teach us

No matter what they call us 
However they attack 
No matter where they take us

I can't be what I'm not

If only night was day 
If only prayers were answered

And shelter from the storm 
No matter where it's barren

No matter who they follow 
No matter where they lead 
No matter how they judge us

I have visions of many things.
Love's happiness is just an illusion filled with sadness and confusion.
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
 
Maybe, the fruits of love grow all around 
but for me they come a tumblin' down.
Ev'ry day heartaches grow a little stronger;
I can't stand this pain much longer.
I walk in shadows, searching for light,
cold and alone, no comfort in sight.
Hoping and prayin' for 
Someone to care, always movin' and goin' nowhere.
 
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
Maybe, I'm searching though I don't succeed,
but someone look, there's a growing need.
Oh, he is lost, there's no place for beginning;
all that's left is an unhappy ending.
 
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
I'll be searching ev'rywhere just find someone to care.
I'll be looking ev'ry day;
I know I'm gonna find a way.
Nothing's gonna stop me now;
I'll find a way some how.

And I could hardly believe my eyes

The moment I looked in your eyes I never will forget
And I remember oh the time that we kissed
Remember thinking to myself could it really be like this
And we danced beneath a midnight moon
And I took one lock
One look at you
And I fell in love before I knew
And the night stood still
And we moved so sweet
So sweet and slow
To the rhythm of the radio
And then your arms reached out and held me close
And the night stood still
I will remember the song that they were playing then
And if I close my eyes I answer
We're right back there again
Do you remember oh the way it used to be
We were two hearts on the run
So young as wild as free

Fear of doing things on my own
The test and trials that come to make me strong
The feelings of guilt, hurt, shame and defeat

Jesus is love",Jesus Is Love
Smokie Norful,"I was preaching a sermon one Sunday and uh
It was about, it was a parable
And it was talking about the uh, the disciples and Jesus
When they were going through a corn field
And they began to pick the corn

And the Pharisees, the legalistics of the day, they came
And they were chastising them that
'Why are you doing this on the Sabbath?'

They had this whole discourse and dialog between the two of them
Jesus was saying, 'Listen, do you, do you not remember that you
You, yourself aren't even worthy
You guys break unleavened bread on, on the Sabbath
And you kill the sacrifice, you clean the sacrifice'

They have a need and it's my job and my responsibility
To meet their need and I'm at their need
I trump the synagogue, I trump the Sabbath
I'm lowered of your life, I'm lowered of everything that is you
I'm lowered of this, this day, recognize who you're talking to

But in the course of the whole thing what I realize is that
The dialog was between the Pharisees or the religious leaders of the day
Was between the dignitaries, the officials of the Church and Jesus
The disciples never uttered a word

He literally started embodying his permanent position in our lives
Because he stepped in between the law and the people
He says, 'No, I'm Grace and because of Me
They don't have to defend themselves to you'

'I'll do all the talking, My blood will speak through all of eternity
I have justified them, even in their wrong, I know that they are wrong
I know that they make mistakes, I know that they are not perfect
I know that they do things that are not pleasing'

'But even in their wrong, My blood will speak on their behalf
And I will just', somebody should have shouted right there
Because He didn't kill you for all the sinful acts that you committed
But he justified you

God bless me with this song, it simply speaks the life of that message
And I'm just excited to be able to share it with you

Hey, justified me, glorified me
Paid my ransom and I've been redeemed by his blood
Go to Calvary, I've been made free
Despite my enemy, I thank God, I'm justified

Paid a price for my life
And all that was wrong, His love made it right
Now what greater sign can any man show?
That know with his own blood He made me whole

He justified me, glorified me
Paid my ransom and I've been redeemed by his blood
Go to calvary, I've been made free
Despite my enemy, I thank God, I'm justified

If my sins had their way I never would have made it
With a debt I just couldn't afford to pay, He came and saved me
When the enemy said that I couldn't, God said go ahead
Because you're covered by me awesome, awesome powerful blood

Though I, I should've been dead and never kept alive
God's grace and his mercy were on every side
When it looks like I can't, God says I can
And he won't let me fall in the enemy's hand

Oh, I'm just glad to know that God saved me
His grace and his mercy
They watched over me all night long
If it had not been, if it had not been
If it had not been, if it had not been
If it had not been for the lord that was on my side
Hey, listen I got some testimonies listen

Just like Nineveh that was headed for destruction
God stepped in and he said
(Not guilt)
You gonna live and you won't see the day of destruction
(Oh oh oh)

Just like Daniel who was condemned to the lion's den, God said
(Not guilt)
You're gonna live
(You're gonna live, yeah)

Just like David who was dearly beloved in spite of God said
(Not guilt)

If you be honest with yourself tonight
If it hadn't been for the grace of God
You would've been, you could've been

To the cheater
(Not guilt)

To the deceiver
(Not guilt)
Even to the believer

There is their point no condemnation to them

That are in Christ Jesus

Some of y'all got it twisted, listen
(Not guilt)
If it hadn't been for God
(God did it)

You wouldn't have made it
Hey, don't get confused about who kept you

There are better things to do with your time

Tossed over waves of emptiness
Looking glass with no reflection

When I needed life, you were a breath of air
When my soul was a desert, you were a fountain
When I needed a rock, you were a mountain

Would someone reach down and touch me
Light drove the shadows from my heart

Then I know it's time to throw
On a funky rhythm so I flow
Now here we go
Follow me follow me follow me down the line
Walk strong, don't need a 9 on my waistline
Niggaz thought that I would slip but I got grip
My mic is loaded and my mind is filled wit many clips
So bring your bulletproof vest 'cause I'm a sharp shooter
Tear a hole in your ass like Roto Rooter
So step if ya want to step, step if ya want to
I'll bust your shit from here to Tijuana
The stage is mine wherever I wreck shop
And if you're steppin' to my crew
You're gettin' dropped
'cause I'm like dat

I'm home all alone got a thought in my temple
Writing to the rhythm 'cause to me it's kind of simple
To slam another jam while the dog is on the cut
You want to bust my shit but ya couldn't bust a nut
You're weak in you mind and your body's lookin' shabby
I'll be cooklin' in my limo while you're chillin' wit your cabby
I strive to survive forward is my motion
I hear a lot of noize what's all the commotion
Ya ain't sayin' nothin' just another sucka frontin'
Slide to the side or I'm gonna bust your fronts in
Cause a lot of damage
Nigga here's your bandage
Tried to hang wit gee ya just couldn't manage

Large is my crew
The crew is very large
Always got my back so I don't need a bodyguard
Wear the camouflage if it need to be worn
When I leave the stage you know the stage is torn

Up the creek without a paddle ya wonder how I'm rowin'
Suckaz I be mowin' when the trucks come to a towin'
Better grab your girl heard that she's hoe'n
Real good looker ya gotta see the hooker
Saw her wit D-Smooth I wonder where he took her
I used to hang wit Danniel had a friend his name was Booker
Sucka tried to play me so I slammed like Jimmy Snucka
'cause I'm like dat

1993 the year of takin' no shorts
SSL crew playin' suckaz like a new sport
Or should I say a new game ya better learn the rulez
Back in '91 we got a rep playin' toolz
But some never learn
They never learn
When will they learn
Burn baby baby burn baby baby burn
Stay on the hush
'Cause we're settin' it off wit an old school bum rush
And I see another victim
So I stick'em and kick'em then lyrically I vic'em
Leave the mind to rust in the dust
As I bust another dope jam 'cause I must slam
When I got a mic in my hand
Don't want to a Grammy if ya can't understand
I'm deep like an ocean
Smooth like a lotion
I've got the notion prepare the potion
Drink while I think
Ya sink in my rhythm
Cling when I sing and get shot like the jizm
Ya ask how I'm livin', well I'm livin'

When she's around
I was on the tracks
When the gate came down
Suddenly I recognized
Those bloodshot rear view mirror eyes as mine

I heard that whistle call my name
I almost drove away
But Megan I had a feeling that you would be on that train
So I just waited there for you

Caught a ride to another town
Where the air was clean
And the sun never goes down
Everyone was standing in a line
Between the landing and the stairs

I heard somebody call my name
I almost climbed the stairs
But Megan I had a feeling that someday you'd meet me there
So I just waited there for you

Butter on a summer day
When I hear that name
It's a dream that never came true
Sat down on the tracks
And waited for a train to take me back to you

Somebody came and took my hand
I finally had to go
But Megan I just want you to know
That I waited as long as I could

Butter on a summer day when she's around",Megan
Smoking Popes,"No more smiles
It's just teardrops falling to the ground
No one's around
And I don't love you anymore
And I'm sore about it
When did my heart change its mind?
It must have been during the changing of times

[Chorus]
No more smiles from now on
They are all gone
I'll never understand what went wrong

[Repeat chorus]
No more lies
Now the hard part's over so they say
There's no way that I could take another day
Let's not talk about it
When did my love for you die?
Kiss me once and it's time to say goodbye

[Chorus x4]",No More Smiles
Smoking Popes,"With all the simple times behind me
I can fail without regret
If I have to try then I will never
Be able to forget
Bottoms down
And out of reasons to hang around

And when the sun is over Hong Kong
I can tell you where she'll be
Floating in a soft and lonely melody
Directly over me
Chocolate eyes at one time melting in mine
But not tonight

[Chorus]
She'll say I love you Paul
I love you Paul
I love you Paul
Hey, hey

And now everything is riding
On a bet that I can't win
If she's not the answer I've been looking for
I'll never ask again
Some say that the answer comes from within
Meanwhile

[Chorus]
Can you tell me where to find me?
Have you seen me hanging around?
I'm looking for myself each night till sunrise
The only thing I've found
Broken dreams and a heart that's stuck to the ground
And with a smile

[Chorus twice]",Paul
Smoking Popes,"You should have heard me sobbing
As I drove home that night
Got into bed and stayed there
For days I just laid there
Having been permanently changed
But we won't get into that now
Let's take it from the start

You should have seen me smiling
Like the world was mine
She used to call me baby
Softly, sometimes
But if I dwell on those days too long
I feel like my life is over
And that's no good
So let's move on

To the part where I begin to sense
Her distance
I panic and hold on tighter
But that makes it worse
How am I supposed to take it
When she said:

""This is something I'm going through,
It's got nothing to do with you""

I had a special evening all planned out
Desperately determined to reignite
Some spark between us
She had to feel something for me
A love as strong as ours
Doesn't just go away
You can't just turn it off
Unless she was lying all those times
But I don't think so
I really don't think so
The way she used to look at me
Made me a thousand feet high
The meaning of the word cool
Not the same geek
Who fumbled through his words that night
The ugliest night

I said some pretty awkward things
I got the feeling that she felt sorry for me
I should have seen it was hopeless and left it alone
But I had to go on embarrassing myself

""I miss what we had I need you so badly,
I miss what we had I need you so badly""

I must have sounded pretty pathetic, I know
That's why I don't blame her for what she said
But listen to me rambling
We don't know each other that well
But you're so easy to talk to
I feel like I can tell you almost anything
I hope I haven't put you off
I have a tendency to do that
Why don't I just be quiet?",Pretty Pathetic
Smoking Popes,"Evening star struck one
Wondering how come
Suddenly becoming completely undone

Just as I looked into your eyes for the first tine
I was already in love with you

Nothing in my dreams
Could possibly have braced me
For the feeling that faced me

Just as I looked into your eyes for the first tine
I was already in love with you

My heart tapped me on the shoulder
And whispered in my ear:

""Don't be a pussy all your life.""",Star Struck One
Smoking Popes,"They lied about the way
Things were gonna be
They lied about the things
They wanted from me

They wanted me at all

About how great things were way back when
I keep forgetting why I was so willing to believe those lies",They Lied
Smoking Popes,"I was at the lowest point of my life
I couldn't talk to anyone
Truly alone
There's no telling what I might have done
If it hadn't been for you
You pulled me through

[Chorus]
I don't know if you actually saved my life
But you changed it that's for sure, yeah
You spoke to me, yeah
You spoke to me, yeah

I drove all the way from Carpentersville
To see you here tonight
And it was worth it
You didn't play my favorite song
But that's all right
I love the new stuff too
I'm just glad I got to see you

[Chorus twice]",You Spoke to Me
Smoking Popes,"Don't take the hand of the man with the platform shoes
Don't take a ride from the guy with the dancing tattoos
Don't close your eyes when he whispers in your ear
All of the words that you long to hear
[Chorus]
You've gotta run away

Deep in the cracks of the pavement they sleep all day
Someday the rain's gonna wash 'em all away
Don't ever think you've got no place else to go
Don't ever think that the world stops at your window

[Chorus]

Don't take the hand of the man with the platform shoes
Don't take a ride from the guy with the dancing tattoos
Don't ever think that you've got no place to go
Don't ever think that the world stops at your window

[Chorus]




",Run Away
Smoking Popes,"Your dreams of love would come true
If you'd only dream that I'm in love with you

Look up at the stars tonight
And guess which one I wished upon
If I were a lucky guy I don't think I'd know what to do
I don't think I'd know what to do

Your eyes, your smile, your hair
Maybe someday I won't have to pretend
But how do I know that I have even got a chance with you?
What good is it if I won't end up with you anyway?

So I'll follow the moon back home
Maybe this is all too soon, I don't know

Look up at the stars tonight
And guess which one I wished upon
If you can find it will my wish come true?

Can you see something in the stars tonight?
Can you see something written in the stars tonight?
Written in the stars tonight

Smoking Popes,"She's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her

The candles flicker and dim,

Help me Jesus I know what I am

I can try to repay
All I've taken from you

With your sleepy eyes

Sometimes cold and scared
Sometimes I cry

But that time I saw you
I knew with you to light my nights
Somehow I'd get by

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Yo, in the land of the unseen hand, and hold trouble
Theorize your game, it's difficult to roll a double
The struggle ain't right up in your face, it's more subtle
But it's still comin' across like the bridge and tunnel vision
I try to school these bucks, but they don't wanna listen
That's the reason the system makin' its paper from the prison
And that's the reason we livin' where they don't wanna visit
Where the dope slang and keep swayin' like Sonny Liston
The money missin' and there's mouths to feed
Yet the brain kickin', thinkin' of a thousand things
Remember back in the days, when the kitchen had eggs
And pancakes, thicken and greens and Kool Aid
When the 'fridgerator naked then the cupboard is bare
People got to strip naked, stick 'em up in the air
Wasn't lies when they told you wasn't nothin' to fear
Somethin' don't feel right out here, know what im sayin'? Check it out

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Look, my eyes open cause I'm really a rocksmith
And when inviting me thoughts, I'm really unboxin'
My main adversary in this silly concoction
Freeze your face like bosilium toxin
If you ain't tryin' to get popped, then give me a option
Helicopters choppin' from Philly to Compton
The Jones is the richest since the Smiths & the Johnson's
If you ain't sayin' nothin', you a system's accomplice
It should play with your conscience, do away with the nonsense
I'm overseeing anything within my circumference
This ain't a press junket, I ain't seekin' responses
I stand where the people got the heat in they pocket
You mesmerized by the calm nonchalant-ness
I spit a dart, rub on some John Hitchcock shit
If you ain't speakin' your life, your rhyme's adopted
If it don't feel right, then stop it, you nahmsayin'?

Yo, field you work in, weapon producin'
Natural disaster got the planet in a panic
We all gots to make that livin'

Forms of hustlin', watch who you put all your trust in
Worldwide, we coincide with who sufferin'
Who never had shit and ain't got nothin'
But most strugglin', and make you wanna run up in the ma' fuckin'
With hots on for a piece of the cake back
I can't work for it, I can certainly take that
I'm fired up, thinkin' about the payback, except
You fuck around and be a enemy of the state, black
I'll, but that'd be too real for TV

Smoothe Da Hustler,"The question is why the answer what makes
If you wants my opinion I tell you don't take x 2

Why...

(Smoothe Da Hustler)
Why is it hard for my words to get heard
The uncut give it to niggas raw gets absorb
Why is it that every black brother talks the slang
Why is it that slang determines if a brother hangs
Why is it that people judge niggas by how they look
Why is it that hoodies on my head makes me a crook
Why is it that people got to struggle to survive
Why is it that nine to five is harder to get in ninety-five
I wonder why that those that heard of me started making records all of a
sudden want to murder me
Why is it that niggas talk the talk but never walk the walk so I talk the
talk if niggas scared to walk New York
Why is it that those who chose to live the street life greet life with a
slug to his mug and scared to greet life
I wonder why it is harder for my family why it is the man in me that keeps
me thinking that no bodys understanding me

Chorus x 4

(Smoothe Da Hustler)
What makes a man a strong man
What makes a woman a strong woman
Don't confuse wrongg one
Cause intellectual keeps it exceptional for both
It is just my professional side that keeps me wondering without a loaf
What makes it possible for me to kick to you
Predict to you for future reference
For you to take heed but that's your preference
What makes two hundred and fifty seven degrees from one hundred eighty seven
five o's tapes Lp's and Cd's
What makes one hundred percent one hundred and ten percent to be quit foul
I am built like five percent is on my lifestlye
What makes my click my click
What makes my chick my chick
What makes my vic my vic
What makes my dick taste an slick
I wonder..
What makes a hustler crew is it what I slang to you
Or what I bring to you
Behind closed doors
Or what I bring to you from of the mind record
What makes me slow is this
What makes me grow is this
What makes me know and blow is this

Chorus x 4
(Smoothe Da Hustler)
Now that everything is of the chest
There is a couple of matters I must attend to before I rest
Don't take my family
Don't take my people
Don't take next level cause to me there's no equal
Don't take my click
Don't take the hoodies or the hats
Don't take the burners and th gats
Don't take the BMW's and the MPV's
Don't take the keys
Don't take the g's
Don't take the gooses
Don't take the grim's
Don't take the kaki jeans or the tims
Don't take the studio
Don't take the tracks
Don't take the spots
Don't take the cracks
Don't take the weed that I smoke
Don't take the name smoothe wrong or this jam for a joke
Don't take the players and the hustlers getting cash
Don't take the projects
Don't take the ave
Don't take the females that I talk to
Don't take the glock that I cock on the blocks that I walk through
Don't take my daughter
Don't take my son
Don't take my pride
Ever died by the gun hold this

Smooths,"The rumble of the engines in the station almost put me to sleep
And the wino covered up with yesterday's news is lying next to me
I see a red-haired girl with ponytails reminding me of you
I don't know why I left it was somethin' I had to do

Looking out the window the skyline fades away
When I see your face I have no idea what I'm gonna say
I've got a picture of me holding you right here in my hands
I recognize my face but I don't know who I am

Now I'm gonna catch a Greyhound
Getting out of this town
I'm gonna catch a Greyhound back to you
I close my eyes, but I can't seem to sleep

And the past rolls through my mind like a river cold and deep
Morning comes and the sky begins to rain
It feels good to feel something even if it's pain
Now I'm gonna catch a Greyhound

Getting out of this town
I'm gonna catch a Greyhound back to you
It's amazing how a tender voice on the other end of the phone
 can change your mind, your life, your plans just by saying

""Daddy, please come home""
Gonna catch a Greyhound
Getting out of this town
I'm gonna catch a Greyhound back to you

Yes, I'm gonna catch a Greyhound
Getting out of this town
I'm gonna catch a Greyhound back to us
I'm starting my life over on a Greyhound bus",Enemy
