Jimmy Page,"Go fetch another white girl
To play with in the sand
The one I have right now is broke
The one I really want has planned
To get religion, to find another way
She's at the temple, all I have to say

I have to face it, I'm home alone
I feel quite naked, oh, so forlorn
I am united in disarray
I've no intentions, I know to pray

Send me a dreamboat
That I can sail away
Adrift in warm devotion, no memory
I feel no pain
To live for new beginnings
To ride the win to win the day
Out on the ocean, decide I've got to stay

I can't get started, I'm at an end
She's got religion, I've lost a friend
I talk in circles, I make no sense
I get so nervous, no recompense

I have to face it, I'm home alone
I feel quite naked, oh, so forlorn
I am united in disarray
I've no intentions, I know to pray

Bring me the brightest star
That I can wish upon
And close my eyes so very tight
Pretend that you're not gone
So deep is my distraction
Maybe I'll disappear

I can't get started, I'm at an end
She's got religion, I've lost a friend
I talk in circles, I make no sense
I get so nervous, no recompense

I have to face it, I'm home alone
I feel quite naked, oh, so forlorn
I am united in disarray
I've no intentions, I know to pray

I can't get started, I'm at an end
She's got religion, I've lost a friend
I talk in circles, I make no sense
I get so nervous, no recompense

Go fetch another nice girl
Another nice girl
Another nice girl
Another nice girl 
Another nice girl
Another nice girl
Another nice girl
Another nice girl",Sons of Freedom
Jimmy Page,"First there was a fire that burned
After came the sea
Crawling through the rain and storm
For you, for me
Slowly walks the sacred fool
Countenance sublime
Shining in the light of love
Shining, shining

Oh, shine for me now
Oh, shine for me now

High upon a golden horse
Out upon the sea
Moves a man with simple words
Some for you now, some for me

Burn for me, burn for me ah
Oh, burn for me now
Oh, burn for me, burn for me ah
Oh oh hoh hoh hoh

Out there where the wild wind blows
Oh, where the soul is free
You will be my brightest star

Jimmy Page,"When I was born I was running
As my feet hit the ground
Before I could walk I was humming
An old railroad sound
Things didn't get much better
When by the age of five
They found me walking into Clarksdale
Trying to keep my friends alive

No time for celebration
There was no known cure
Seems I was born and raised
In the wrong killing floor
And my loved ones gathered round see
If the experiment had worked
I was misplaced, out of time
privileged and worse

Oh, mama please
Don't cry for me
Tears to the river
Tears to be free

Now I see twelve white horses
Walking in a line
Moving east across the metal
Bridge on highway 49
And standing in the shadows
Of a burnt out motel
The king of Commerce Mississippi waited
With his hound from hell, oh

A shiny noon riverboat taking
Income from the poor
It's floating by the levee in
an artificial pool
There's a six mile tailback
Back on junction 304
A stranger at the crossroads
Believe I've seen his face before

Oh,
Don't cry for me
Tears fill the river
Tears to be free

Oh, I'm sad to be leaving
The sun is going down and I really got to go now
I'm sad to be leaving
The sun's going down and I really got to go now
Really got to go now
I gotta go
I've got to move
I've got to move, yeah, ah

I'm sad to be leaving
Sun's going down and I really got to go now
I'm sad to be leaving
The sun's going down and I really got to go now, oh 

I'm sad to be leaving
Sun's going down and I really got to go now

The sun's going down and I really got to go now

Really got to go now, yeah

Yes, gotta go now

Jimmy Page,"I was reaching for the future
Slowly floating in the blue
When I was a boy
I dreamed a dream of you

I danced upon the tree top
I drifted with the stream
When I was a child
I held you in my dreams

In my castle strong

When I was a boy
I slept at Heaven's gate

I could do no wrong
Innocence and slumber

Jimmy Page,"Shapes of things before my eyes
Just teach me to despise
Will time make men more wise?

Here within my lonely frame
My eyes just heard my brain
But will it seem the same?

Come tomorrow, will I be older?
Come tomorrow, may be a soldier
Come tomorrow, may I be bolder than today?

Now the trees are almost green
But will they still be seen
When time and tide have been?

Fallin' into your passing hands
Please don't destroy these lands
Don't make them desert sands

Come tomorrow, will I be older?
Come tomorrow, may be a soldier
Come tomorrow, may I be bolder than today?

Soon I hope that I will find
Thoughts deep within my mind
That won't displace my kind",Shapes of Things [Live]
Jimmy Page,"In my time of sorrow,
In my time of feeling bad
Oh what I'd give
Just to relive
All of the good times that I've had.

In my time of sorrow
In my time of feeling alone
There was a time
I could ease my mind
With thoughts of just being on my own.

Changes of life
I'm going through
Keep me from doing
What I know I should do.

In my time of sorrow
In my time where teardrops fall

For me to say fare well.

Jimmy Page,"Listen to the talk that's going around town
Everywhere you go they're spreading it around
Saying that you've gone and found another one
Is it true, my love?
What about the ring you gave me yesterday?
Is it hard for me to throw it all away
As you said goodbye, if you have no lie
Is it true my love?

Don't you know, don't you know
You're making me blue
Baby, baby say it isn't, say it isn't true

Jimmy Page,"Why does the sky turn gray every night
Sun rise again in time
Why do you think of the first love you had
Somethings just stick in your mind

Why does the rain fall down on the earth
Why do the clouds keep crying
Why do you sleep curled up like a child
Some things just stick in your mind

Why when the children grow up and leave
Still remember their nursery rhymes
Why must there be so much hate in their lives
Some things just stick in their minds",Some Things Just Stick in Your Mind
Jimmy Page,"Trains and boats and planes are passing by
They mean a trip to Paris or Rome
To someone else but not for me
The trains and boats and planes
Took you away, away from me

We were so in love, and high above
We had a star to wish upon. Wish
And dreams come true, but not for me
The trains and boats and planes
Took you away, away from me

You are from another part of the world
You had to go back a while and then
You said you soon would return again
I'm waiting here like I promised to
I'm waiting here but where are you

Trains and boats and planes took you a way
But every time I see them I pray
And if my prayers can cross the sea
The trains and the boats and planes
Will bring you back, back home to me",Trains and Boats and Planes

Jimmy Parrish,"Hey, where did we go
Days when the rains came ?
Down in the hollow
Playing a new game
Laughing and a-running, hey, hey

In the misty morning fog with
Our, our hearts a-thumping
And you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

To Tuesday and so slow
Going down to the old mine with a
Transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hide behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and a-sliding
All along the waterfall

Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium

Jimmy Payne,"Why me Lord, what have I ever done
To deserve even one
Of the pleasures I've known
Tell me Lord, what did I ever do
That was worth loving you
Or the kindness you've shown.

Lord help me Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.

Tell me Lord, if you think there's a way
I can try to repay
All I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself
On my way back to you.

Alone where we have walked together

For flames live such a little while

And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.

The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves
Jimmy Raney,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Here's That Rainy Day
Jimmy Raney,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You? [Live]
Jimmy Raney,"Don't stamp your foot at me
It's impolite
To stamp your foot at me
Is not quite right
At man's ingratitude
A woman winks
But such an attitude just stinks

I have eyes for you to give you dirty looks
I have words that do not come from children's books
there's a trick with a knife I'm learning to do
And everything I've got belongs to you
I've a powerful anesthesia in my fist
And the perfect wrist to give your neck a twist
There are hammerlock holds
I've mastered a few
And everything I've got belongs to you
Share for share, share alike
You get struck each time I strike
You for me- me for me
I'll give you plenty of nothing
I'm not yours for better but for worse
And I've learned to give the well-known witches' curse
I've a terrible tongue, a temper for two
And ev'rything I've got belongs to you

Don't raise your voice at me
That's very rude
To raise your voice at me
Is rather crude
It's wrong essentially when woman yells
And confidentially, it smells

I'll converse with you on politics at length
I'll protect you with my superhuman strength
If you're ever attacked I'll scream and say , ""Boo!''
And everything I've got belongs to you
I will never stray from home, I'll just stay put
Cause I've got a brand-new thing called athlete' s foot
I'm a victim of colds, anemia, too
And everything I've got belongs to you
Off to bed we will creep
Then we'll sleep and sleep and sleep
Till the birds start to peep
I'll give you plenty of nothing
I'll be yours forever and a day
If the first good breeze does not blow me away
You're enough for one man, that's why I'll be true
And everything I've got belongs to you

You may have some things that I can't use at all
When I look at you, your manly gifts are small
I've a wonderful way of saying adieu
And everything I've got belongs to you
You won't know how good I am until you try
And you'll let my well of loneliness run dry
I've a marvelous way of telling you no
And everything I've got belongs to you
And everything you want belongs to me!
And everything you need belongs to me!

Life has no shape or form
And no design
It isn't life without
That fool of mine
I used to gad about
With any chap
And now I'm sad about my sap

He's a living thing that isn't quite alive
He has brains enough for any child of five
Oh, he isn't too rich in vigor and vim
But everything I've got belongs to him
He's a naughty brat that can't be left alone
He has eyes for every skirt except my own
Even under a tree, he grabs for the limb
But everything I've got belongs to him
Something beats in his chest
But it's just a pump at best
I'm for him, he's for him
He gives me plenty of nothing
When I see that funny face, I know
Something scared his mother twenty years ago
But I'll never let go, he'll never be free!
Till everything he's got belongs to me!

And everything I've got belongs to him!
And everything I've got belongs to us!",Everything I've Got
Jimmy Raney,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss",Prelude to a Kiss
Jimmy Raney,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You
Jimmy Raney,"It begins to tell
'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad
'Round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings'

Let the angels sing

Jimmy Raney,"You are too beautiful, my dear, to be true
And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling that because I have found you
I could have bound you too

You are too beautiful for one man alone
For one lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you
It's not through a sense of duty
You are too beautiful
And I am a fool for beauty

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you
It's not through a sense of duty
You are too beautiful
And I am a fool for beauty",You Are Too Beautiful
Jimmy Raney,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?
How long has this, been going on?",How Long Has This Been Going On
Jimmy Rankin,"I followed her around
I was quite naïve
Holes in my soul
I wore my heart upon my sleeve
Down that winding country road
Despite the stories I'd been told
Now I don't go in to town
Since I followed her around

I stood and watched in disbelief
From the shadows of my grief
She wore lipstick black as coal
And her boots up to her knees
How could I even speak my mind
All the boys were making time
I bowed my head without a sound
Since I followed her around

Everybody's got a hunger
And a seed they gotta sow
I should have listened to my mother
When she cried no, child no
Son get your feet back on the ground
Don't go follow her around

I watched her from afar
That pretty flower in mid bloom
Oh how that girl could work a bar
As she waltzed around the room
I couldn't take it anymore
Tried to get her out the door
One more time she shot me down
Since I followed her around

Everybody's got a hunger
And a seed they gotta sow
I should have listened to my mother
When she cried no, child no
Son get your feet back on the ground
Don't go follow her around

Now I'm old and wise
Still got that sparkle in my eyes
All my kids have come and gone
All except my youngest son
It was just the other day
I swore I heard him say
Dad I'm heading in to town
I think he follows her around
Dad I'm heading in to town
I think he follows her around
Dad I'm rolling in to town
I think he follows her around",Followed Her Around

The girl has found another and gone away.
With her went my future my life is filled with gloom
So day after day I stay locked up in my room.
I know to you, it might sound strange but I wish it would rain,

'Cause so badly I wanna go outside
But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I gotta cry 'cause crying eases the pain,
Oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside.
Words could never explain, I just wish it would rain.

Day in day out my tear-stained face
Pressed against the window pain,
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain,
Cause rain-drops will hide my tear -drops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying,
Crying when I go outside.
To the world outside my tears,
I refuse to explain, oh I wish it would rain,
Let it rain, let it rain.
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes.
Oh, let it rain.
I'm a man and I got my pride
Til' it rains I'm gonna stay inside and let it rain.",I Wish It Would Rain

She's got this journal filled
With all her black ink guilt
And love is the only thing keeping her alive
She's got her mind made up
That all she needs is love
Her heart is the only thing helping her decide
To breathe again, to breathe again
Verse 1
And when she's tired she doesn't sleep
A week since I've seen her eat
She's skin and bones, she's beautiful
No matter what
I wish I could help her see
She means the world to me
But the world, it doesn't mean much to her

Like when the ice berg hits 
And the ship has to break apart

I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.

When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You?
Jimmy Roselli,"Just picture a penthouse way up in the sky
With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by
A sweet slice of Heaven for just you and I
When we're alone.

From all of society we'll stay aloof
And live in propriety there on the roof.
Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth
When we're alone.

We'll see life's mad pattern
As we view old Manhattan
Then we can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are.

In our little penthouse we'll always contrive
To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive,
When we're alone.

Hoping ev'ry cloud will be silver lined.

They wear fancy ties and laces,
But where do they get their aces?

And that is their ace in the hole,
And others have friends on the old Tenderloin;

Recitation:
Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love
There isn't a trace or a sign
Of that regular honest to goodness old bunch
That I call that old gang of mine",That Old Gang of Mine

Jimmy Roselli,"For once in my life I have someone who needs me
Someone I’ve needed so long
For once unafraid I can go where life leads me and somehow I know I’ll be strong

For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Someone warm like you
Who have my dreams come true

For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before

For once I have someone I know won't desert me
I’m not alone anymore

For once I can say 
This is mine you can’t take it
As long as I know I have love I can make it
For once in my life I have someone who needs me

For once I can say
This is mine you can’t take it

As long as I know I have love we can make it

Jimmy Roselli,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay

In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two

Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you

And why, because you're mine, because you're mine
I only know for as long as I may live
I'll only live for the kiss that you alone may give me
And when we kiss that isn't thunder dear

Jimmy Roselli,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

Jimmy Roselli,"Someone that I belong to
Doesn't belong to me
Someone who can't be faithful
Knows that I have to be
Wonder if I am wrong to give her my loyalty

Why should I be a lone soul
Why can't I be my own soul
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another
For I'm not free
She's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Up on my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love.

Jimmy Roselli,"To spend one night with you in our old rendezvous,
And reminisce with you that's my desire.
To meet where gypsies play, down in that dim cafe,
And dance 'till break of day that's my desire.
We'll sip a little glass of wine, I'll gaze into your eyes divine.

I wanna go and bounce the moon

It was spring

Then in the room somewhere someone began to sing 
This serenade made for remembering
 
A small cafe, Mam'selle
Our rendezvous, Mam'selle
The violins were warm and sweet 
And so were you, Mam'selle
And as the night danced by 
A kiss became a sigh
Your lovely eyes seemed to sparkle 
Just like wine does
No heart ever yearned the way mine does for you
And yet I know too well 
Some day you'll say goodbye 
Then violins will cry 
And so will I, Mam'selle

And wondrous wishing wells
And nowhere else on God's green Earth
There be such lakes and dells

No wonder that the angels love
That shamrock covered shore
It draws my heart home again
And I love it more and more

Have you ever heard the story of
How Ireland got its name
Well, I'll tell you so you'll understand
From whence old Ireland came

No wonder that I love
That dear old land across the sea
For here's the way my dear old Father
Told the tale to me

Sure, a little bit of heaven fell
From out the sky one day
And it nestled on the ocean
In a spot so far away

And when the angels found it
Sure, it looked so sweet and fair
They said, ""Suppose we leave it
For it looks so peaceful there""

So they sprinkled it with stardust
Just to make the shamrocks grow
'Tis the only place you'll find them
No matter where you go

Then they dotted it with silver
To make its lakes so grand
And when they had it finished
Sure, they called it Ireland!",A Little Bit of Heaven

Jimmy Roselli,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose

Jimmy Rosenberg,"You took my kisses and you took my love
You taught me how to care
Am I to be just the remnant of a one-sided love affair?
All you took, I gladly gave
There's nothing left for me to save

All of me why not take all of me
Can't you see I'm no good without you

I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,

I've felt this pain before.  A hurt that took so long to end.  Has found my poor heart again.    As I watch love walking away.  It brings back old memories.  But a familiar pain still feels the same.  Once again, heartache has found me.    A dark cloud covered my heart.  Oh, when she told me goodbye.  Now there's nothing left but emptiness.  And the tears that filled my crying eyes.    I've passed this way before.  I've felt this pain before.  A hurt that took so long to end.  Has found my poor heart again.    No matter how strong a man is.  Without a love he walks in the dark, baby.  If love deserts him it would surely hurt him.  'Cause his weakness is his heart.    A lonely journey now stands before me.

They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Jimmy Rushing,"I can still remember
When I bought my first guitar
Remember just how good the feeling
To put it proudly in my car
And my family listened fifty times
To my two song repertoire
I told my mom
Her only son was gonna be a star
Bought all the Beatles records
I sounded just like Paul
I bought all the old Chuck Berry's - 78's and all
I sat by my record player
Playing every note they played
I watched them all on TV
Making every move they made

Rock and roll, I gave you all
The best years of my life
All the dreamy sunny Sundays 
All the moonlit summer nights
I was so busy in the backroom
Writing love songs to you
While you were changing your direction
And you never even knew
That I was always just one step behind you

Sixty-six seemed like the year
I was really going somewhere
We were living in San Francisco
With flowers in our hair
Singing songs of kindness
So the world would understand
To the guys and me you were something more
Than just another band
 
And then sixty-nine in LA
Came around so soon
We were really making headway 
And writing lots of tunes
And we must have played
The wildest stuff that we had ever played
And the way the crowds cried out for us
We thought we had it made

Rock and roll, I gave you all
The best years of my life
All the crazy, lazy, young days 
All the magic moon at night
I was so busy on the road
Singing love songs to you
While you were changing your direction
And you never even knew
That I was always just one step behind you

Seventy-one and so alone 
When I met Susanne
I was trying to go it solo
With someone else's band
She came up to me later
And I took her by the hand
And I told her all my troubles
And she seemed to understand

And she followed me to London 
Through a hundred hotel rooms
Through a hundred record companies 
Who didn't like my tunes
She followed me when finally 
I sold my old guitar
She tried to help me
Understand I'd never be a star

Rock and roll, I gave you
All the best years of my life
All the dreamy, sunny Sundays
All the moonlit summer nights
And though I never knew
The magic of making it with you
That I thank the Lord for giving me
The little bit I knew
And I was always just one step behind you",Rock and Roll

We looked at each other in the same way then

Jimmy Smith,"Love is a many splendored thing
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth

To keep love and romance forever alive

Are still around us

An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you

When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Swaying to a fascinating strain

When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating

Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word
That's why everybody loves him so

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

What a lonesome old town this will be
Children's voice at play, will be still for a day

Jimmy Smith,"Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl
Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl

I was once out strolling one very hot summer's day
When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest
In a big field of tall grass
I lay there in the sun and felt it caressing my face

And I fell asleep and dreamed
I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie
And that I was the star of the movie
This really blew my mind, the fact that me
An overfed, long-haired leaping gnome
Should be the star of a Hollywood movie

But there I was, I was taken to a place, the hall of the mountain kings
I stood high upon a mountain top, naked to the world
In front of every kind of girl, there was
Black ones, round ones, big ones, crazy ones

Out of the middle came a lady
She whispered in my ear something crazy
She said

Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl
Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl

I thought to myself what could that mean
Am I going crazy or is this just a dream
Now, wait a minute
I know I'm lying in a field of grass somewhere
So it's all in my head
And then I heard her say one more time:

Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl
Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl

I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back
As she disappeared, but soon she returned
In her hand was a bottle of wine, in the other, a glass
She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass
And raised it to her lips
And just before she drank it, she said

Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl
Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl",Spill the Wine

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Like the kicker in a julep or two

That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

With the wink of an eye and there's chaos in sight

Jimmy Somerville,"He remembers at fourteen.
He knew what he wanted.
He wanted a man; no psychiatry,
Just to be held to be told it was alright.
All he got was a hospital bed
And some pills to sleep at night.
In his mind were images so divine,
But in his life it was a hell of a time.

They locked him away
Because he dared to love
A boy with a mind of his own.

He wonders if anyone
Has ever heard of him.
They kicked in the door,
Acting like there was
Some kind of murder going on.
Made their love seem dirty;
Called him sick; called him queer.
The law was against him.
He was twenty-five, his lover sixteen;
Couldn't believe it was happening.
It seemed so unreal,
But a cell, twelve by eight,
Made it all so very real.

They locked him away
Because he dared to love
A boy with a mind of his own.
He loved a boy with a mind of his own.

Where is the crime?  Where is the crime in love?
He loved a boy with a mind of his own.
They locked him away

Jimmy Somerville,"Burning blood
You leave me paralyzed
Your clarity
(??) My rational

Romanticize
You seduce than traumatize
It's hard to see
When you take my dignity

You go to my head
Take me out of my breath
Under your spell
(Amnesia) (x4)

You taste so good
But you slowly poison me
In endless nights
With clouded mystery

You take me there
Such a drunken refugee
We disconnect
From all reality

You go to my head
Take me out of my breath
Under your spell

Jimmy Sturr,"Riding on the City of New Orleans,
Illinois Central Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders,
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail.
All along the southbound odyssey
The train pulls out at Kankakee
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields.
Passin' trains that have no names,
Freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles.

Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

Dealin' cards with the old men in the club car.
Penny a point ain't no one keepin' score.
Won't you pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor.
And the sons of Pullman porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpets made of steam.
Mothers with their babes asleep,
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they dream.

Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

Nighttime on The City of New Orleans,
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee.
Half way home, we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness
Rolling down to the sea.
And all the towns and people seem
To fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news.
The conductor sings his song again,
The passengers will please refrain
This train's got the disappearing railroad blues.

Good night, America, how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.",City of New Orleans [Polka]
Jimmy Sturr,"The devil went down to Scunthorpe
Looking for a soul to steal
In a bind and way behind
He was willin' to make a deal
When he came across this young man
Pickin' on a guitar, playing it hot
And the devil jumped on a hickory stump
And said I'll tell ya what

I guess you didn't know it
I'm a guitar player too
And if you care to take a dare
I'll make a bet with you
Now you play a real good guitar boy
But give the devil his due
I'll bet a guitar of gold to get your soul
'Cause I think I'm better than you

The boy said my name's Johnny, it might be a sin
I'll take your bet, you're gonna regret
I'm the best that's ever been

Johnny resin up your pick
And play your guitar hard
'Cause hell is here in Scunthorpe
And the devil deals the cards
Now if you win you'll get
This shinny guitar made of gold
But if you loose the devil gets your soul

The devil opened up his case
And said I'll start this gig
And fire flew from his finger tips
As he resined up his pick
He strummed the pick across the strings
It made an evil hiss
Then a band of demons joined in
And it sounded something like this

When the devil finished
Johnny said you're pretty good ol' son
But sit down in that chair right there
Let me show you how it's done

Fire on the mountain run boys run
Devil's in the house of the risin' sun
Chicken in the bread pan pickin' out dough
Ready says you don't fight, no child, no
Let's go

The devil bowed his head
Because he knew that he'd been beat
He laid that golden guitar
On the ground at Johnny's feet
Johnny said Devil come on back 
If you ever want to try again
I told you once you son of a bitch
I'm the best I've ever been

From the California to the New York island
From the Redwood Forest, to the gulf stream waters

I saw above me that endless skyway
And saw below me that golden valley
This land was made for you and me

I roamed and rambled and I followed my footsteps
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts
And all around me , a voice was sounding

In the wheat fields waving and dust clouds rolling
The voice was chanting as the fog was lifting

Jimmy Swift,"Nothing is true, yeah ain't that the truth
But who am I to spread these lies to you
But an honest man, if there is such a thing 
But I guess that depends on what the truth might bring 
What it might leave behind

Cause when it comes down to it anyway
It doesn't make much sense at all
And if we fall together
Will we land together
In the center of it all

And the mystery as it seems to me
It just might change the whole path of history
And ones left behind

Cause when it comes down to it anyway
It doesn't make much sense at all
And if we fall together
We will rise together
In the center of it all
After all this should be all the evidence you need
To keep moving on 
And on and on and on...

And moving along
To get to the end
I've learned that it's no way to treat my closest friends
It's further away, and so everyday
Seems better then the one before had been
And on and on...

Cause when it comes down to it everyday
It's a piece of who we are
And as we stand together on our tip toes
To see what's coming next
We forget what we were looking for
And we start all over again
All over again

Jimmy Urbina,"How can I convince you what you see is real
Who am I to blame you for doubting what you feel
I was always reachin', you were just a girl I knew
I took for granted the friend I have in you

I was living for a dream,
Loving for a moment
Taking on the world,
That was just my style
Now I look into your eyes
I can see forever,
The search is over
You were with me all the while

Can we last forever, will we fall apart
At times it's so confusing, these questions of the heart
You followed me through changes, and patiently you'd wait
Till I came to my senses, through some miracle of fate

I was living for a dream,
Loving for a moment
Taking on the world,
That was just my style
Now I look into your eyes
I can see forever,
The search is over
You were with me all the while

Now the miles stretch out behind me loves that I have lost

Broken hearts lie victims of the game
Then good luck it finally stuck like lightning from the blue
Every highway leading me back to you
Now at last I hold you, now all is said and done
The search has come full circle, our destinies are one
So if you ever loved me show me that you give a damn
You'll know for certain the man I really am

I was living for a dream,
Loving for a moment
Taking on the world,
That was just my style
Now I look into your eyes
I can see forever,

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

I haven't felt like this
In God knows how long
I know everything's going to be OK
If you just stay gone

I still love you
And I will forever
We can't hide the truth
We know each other better
When we try to make it work
We bother end up hurt
And it ain't supposed to be that way

So baby, baby, stay, stay right where you are
I like it this way
It's good for my heart
I haven't felt like this
In God knows how long
I know everything's going to be OK
If you just stay gone

When we try to make it work
We both end up hurt
Love ain't supposed to be that way

So baby, baby, stay, stay right where you are
I like it this way
It's good for my heart

I know everything's going to be OK
If you just stay gone

If you just stay gone",Stay Gone
Jimmy Wayne,"Cool river
Hot August night
Her sweet body next to mine
Lonesome whistle
Moans in the distance
Young hearts poundin'
No resistance

[Chorus]
There was a sign on the fence
But we found our way in
Didn't feel wrong
Spent all night long trespassin'

Jealous moon
Sneakin' through the trees
Cattails whisper in the midnight breeze
Tangled hair
Tremblin' hands
The whole town sleeps while shadows dance

[Chorus]

Forgotten secrets
Race through my mind
Leave me wonderin' where she is tonight

Jimmy Wayne,"Baby when I look at you
You know it breaks my heart in two
How beautiful you are
I've seen you in a million dreams
Now you're finally here with me
We will never be apart
I want to hold you forever
That's all I'll ever need

[Chorus]
You are my love 
You are my life
My heart and soul
The truest friend I've ever known
You are my world
All of my dreams 
My fantasy, my reality
I love everything you are

Every time I close my eyes
It hits me so deep inside
How real this feeling is
I'm intoxicated by your touch
It's a sweet, sweet rush
I'm in love with your kiss
You're the one I trust the most
You change me

[Chorus: x2]

Everything, I love everything you are",You Are
Jimmy Wayne,"I ain't the best, I ain't the worst
Won't be the last, sure ain't the first
Man who ever had a dream that finally got a break
So don't take this wrong I know I'm blessed
But what you see is what you get
My own interpretation of what's missing most these days
Identity, a real point of view
A little honesty, things we all could use

[Chorus:]
I don't think the world's all bad
That life is cheap and love don't last
In fact I think it's just a few who'd like us to believe that's true
I think most are sick and tired of all the hip and uninspired
Saying cool is in and good is out
I bet I've got your attention now and oh if I don't then
You're the one I'm talking to
You're the one I'm talking to

I'm tired of seeing youthful eyes
Growing up desensitized
By what they're seeing on TV, believing that's reality
That sex is love and life's a game
Where all the winners look the same
Designer jeans, expensive shoes, imported cars and attitudes
What happened to individuality
The right to choose your destiny?

[Chorus:]
I don't think the world's all bad
That life is cheap and love don't last
In fact I think it's just a few who'd like us to believe that's true
I think most are sick and tired of all the hip and uninspired
Saying cool is in and good is out
I bet I've got your attention now and oh if I don't then
You're the one I'm talking to
You're the one I'm talking to

I don't believe the world's all bad
That life is cheap and love don't last
That cool is in and good is out
Have I got your attention now?
'cause if I don't then
You're the one I'm talking to
You're the one I'm talking to

I've got food

As big as I want to
And I've got you

I don't have lots of fame
And I won't be the biggest of names

I've got songs that I wrote from my heart
And people to sing 'em to

That don't mean there's nobody there

More love than you'll ever need

Sun's gonna shine down on me and you
Don't worry about the thunder, we'll just run for cover
And stay there until it's through

So come on, hide away, as long as it takes
Just hold on, hold on, hold on
Keep holding on, and on, and on
For brighter days

It's the sign of the change of the season
When birds, they start to flying away
Think it's time you and I should be leaving
So hurry, let's get out of the rain

Don't be crying, sweet dandelion
Just let the wind take you wherever it blows
And don't be scared I'll be waiting there
No matter how far you go

The day I turned to you and said
I didn't like the way he was looking at you, yeah
How it made you laugh
You just couldn't get what I was saying
It was my imagination

I guess I really wasn't that crazy
And I knew what I was talking bout
Every time the sun goes down
He's the one that's holding you baby
Yeah me I'm missin' you way across town
So do you believe me now

I'm kicking myself
For being the one foolish enough
Giving him the chance to step in my shoes
He was bidin' his time
When he saw our love was having a moment of weakness
He was there between us

Jimmy Wayne,"He can't remember the times that he thought
Does my daddy love me?
Probably not
But that didn't stop him from wishing that he did
Didn't keep from wanting or worshiping him

He guesses he saw him about once a year
He could still feel the way he felt
Standing in tears
Stretching his arms out as far as they'd go
Whispering daddy, I want you to know

I love you this much and I'm waiting on you
To make up your mind, do you love me too?
However long it takes
I'm never giving up
No matter what, I love you this much

He grew to hate him for what he had done
Cause what kind of a father, could do that to his son
He said 'damn you daddy', the day that he died
The man didn't blink, but the little boy cried

I love you this much and I'm waiting on you
To make up your mind, do you love me too?
However long it takes
I'm never giving up
No matter what, I love you this much

Half way through the service
While the choir sang a hymn
He looked up above the preacher
And he sat and stared at him

He said ""Forgive me Father""
When he realized
That he hadn't been unloved or alone all his life
His arms were stretched out as far as they'd go
Nailed to the cross, for the whole world to know

I love you this much and I'm waiting on you
To make up your mind, do you love me too?
However long it takes
I'm never giving up
No matter what, I love you this much",I Love You This Much [*]
Jimmy Wayne,"So you're the one
I've waited on
The one I've been dreaming of
Now that I know
It's hard to let go
I don't wanna lose your love
But what can I do
I can't make you stay here
But if you should choose
To go your own way where
Ever you're going
Whenever you turn
Remember this moment
Remember these words
I will
I will

Give up my life for you
If you wanted
Give you my heart
You already own it
I'll do anything
I'll go anywhere
It's true
I will
I will
I will

I look in your eyes
And I see our life
So full of happiness
Do you see the same
Just someone you'll blame
For things that you might've missed
I don't wanna weigh you down like an anchor
If that's how you see me now
I would rather
Let you go free
Just sail away
If that's what you need
If that's what it takes

Give up my life for you
If you wanted
Give you my heart
You already own it

You need someone to hold you

Who really knows you

You see diamonds are made
Between a rock and a hard place

For losing all this love
Hope is the greatest expectation

Old love letters that just might
Who might have tried to break me down
You might have seen my cry

I'm, I'm not foolish and I'm not blind

And I waited for love to be kind
With a heart that didn't die

It just feels a little deeper
So don't worry 'bout me
It's all that I need
I'm a true believer

I get up every day
I think of you more than I should
I won't let you disgrace the whole human race
I believe people are good

I, I just say it was all for the best
I won't compromise
And I won't close my eyes
And pretend I can live with a list

I'll just say goodbye
To the way that I thought that we were
I won't give up the world
'Cause more than anything

I believe in love, bigger than us
I believe it's the strong
That I just gotta trust
I give all that I have, I believe it so much

I, I believe that something heavenly
With all the mistakes
And the pain that love takes
I still believe in what it could be

There's a Godly sound, talking to all us sinners
So don't worry 'bout me, 'cause that's all that I need
No, don't worry 'bout me, cause that's all that I need

Nobody but me to blame

Could be a thousand miles away

Lost souls, slowly losing faith
Longing for anything to hold onto, mm-hmm

Now I don't have all the answers but I know this much is true
You got to have something to believe in 
And I believe in you

I changed my life for something simple as that
Holding you close, when you look at me 
Long slow kisses so tenderly

It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard

Pulling your puzzles apart

Jimmy Webb,"It's the ending of my day
No one left to say goodbye to, except you, piano
You're not listening anyway
You're not even try to but here's one for you, piano

Seems like it always comes down to me, spinning my piano stool
While you just sit there, grinning like a fool
One last song I gotta play, don't want to keep you up all night though
I make it mezzo piano

Kinda tired in my own way
Trying to keep myself upright though just like you, piano
Just keep smiling and I'll play this tune for you
Just keep smiling and we'll pull each other through

Softly, we'll play our folding music
And we'll fade, fade away

",Piano
Jimmy Webb,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Jimmy Webb,"Tonight in a bar alone 
I'm sitting apart from 
The laughter and the cheer
Scenes from the past 
Rise before me while 
Watching the bubbles in my beer
Visions of someone 
Who loved me brings 
Along salty tears to my eyes
And I know that my life's 
Been a failure 
Watching the bubbles in my beer

I'm seeing the road 
That I've traveled 
A road paved 
With heartaches and tears
And I'm seeing the past 
That I've wasted

Jimmy Webb,"All my love's laughter
And all my love's faces
She comes in the morning
Her cloak in her arms

She's following after
The king of all places
And your tenderest warnin'
Could bruise all her charm

But don't lose your heart
To that beautiful sinner
She walks without shining a light now

She stands in the shade
And the sun is there in her
But you'll never know till it's night

All my love's softness
And ll my love's graces
She carries all things
In her tiny white glove

She hides all her lostness
In satins and laces
And everyone says, everyone says
She's searching for sweet love

But don't try to hold on
To Satan's proud lady
She stands with her flock
All alone on the hill

Her stockings are hung
And her eyes are so shady
She's winning and you never will

",All My Love's Laughter
Jimmy Webb,"I met her on a plane
I had forgotten I was made of glass
I watched the cars and crows and cities pass
You know, I watched the sun till I was blind
I tried to drive her from my mind
But I kept seeing her and I
Disappearing in the scenery
I was humming, humming inside
Mmm mmm humming, I was humming inside

She told me of her pain
She did not know that I was hearing her
She did not know that I was nearing her
You know the sun it did remain
And from the glaciers to the plain
Her eyes burned bluer than the skies
That still exist over Nevada

Your whole life's in a single day
And you're reaching for the moments
As the seconds slip away

And I see you at a party
But I'm closer to the stars
And I'm closer to the teacups
Where the universes are

Where the universes are
Where the universes are
And I stumble to my car
Sweet Lord, I'm off to find another bar
I'm off to find another bar

And I'll miss you in the island
And I'll miss you at the fair
And I'll miss a lot of places
'Cause my love, you won't be there

And I don't know where I'm goin'
But I know I'm goin' far

To be with you on the California coast
Drinking margaritas all night in the old cantina
Out on, out on the California coast

Don't think that I'm ungrateful
And don't look so morose
Adios, adios

We never really made it baby
But we came pretty close
Adios, adios

Going up north where the hills are winter green
I got to leave you on the California coast
Going where the water's clear and the air is cleaner
Than, than the California Coast

Our dreams of endless summer
Were just too grandiose
Adios, adios

And I miss the blood red sunset
But I miss you the most
Adios, adios
Adios, adios
Adios, adios

",Adios
Jimmy Webb,"Every year when this day rolls around
I think of the night we first tore up the town
And I wonder if you're laughing with your eyes glowing
Making pretty conversation with the wines flowing
I'm runnin' your place just like always
Just like always, baby

Everyday at least one time
I look at your face in the back of my mind
When you're smiling at the ocean and your eyes shining
When your hair's a red river and it's all mine
For a thousand days just like always

Maybe someday I believe we'll forget
I'll really learn to live again, I'll live without regret
Funny, isn't it? This man ain't laughing yet
Does love really last forever?
Does the ocean love the sunset every time?

I pass your street, I look both ways, so incomplete
And I think that I might see you but of course, I don't
And I wish that you would call me but I know you won't
And I love you anyway just like always
Just like always, baby, just like always, just like always

",Just Like Always
Jimmy Webb,"By the time I get to Phoenix, she'll be rising
She'll find the note I left hanging on her door
She'll laugh when she reads the part that says
I'm leaving 'cause I've left that girl so many time before

By the time I make Albuquerque, she'll be working
She'll probably stop at lunch and give me a call
But she'll just hear that phone keep on ringing
Off the wall, that's all

By the time I make Oklahoma, she'll be sleeping
She'll turn softly and call my name out low
And she'll cry just to think I'd really leave her
Though time and time I've tried to tell her so
She just didn't know I would really go

",By the Time I Get to Phoenix

Didn't we?
This time we almost made some sense of it

Then I touched it and it had turned to sand

This time we almost sang our song in tune
Didn't we, love?
This time we almost made it, made it to the moon 
Didn't we, love?
This time we almost made our poem rhyme
This time we almost made that long hard climb

I still hear your sea winds blowing
I still see her dark eyes glowing

I still hear your sea waves crashing
While I watch the cannon flashing

And I dream of Galveston

I still see her standin' by the water
Standin' there lookin' out to sea

Jimmy Webb,"I was a highwayman
Along the coach roads I did ride
With the sword and pistol by my side
And many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
And many a soldier shed his life blood on my blade
They fin'lly hung me in the spring of '25
But I am still alive

I was a sailor
And I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide
I sailed a schooner 'round the horn of Mexico
I went aloft to furl the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they say that I got killed
But I am living still

I was a dam builder
Across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around
Seems like it all goes 'round and 'round
And 'round and 'round

I'll fly a starship
Across the universe divide
Until I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again
And again, and again, and again.",Highwayman

Of things that they remember well
Stories and faces dearly held

These would have a tale to tell
Of sun goin' down and dinner bell
And children playing at hide and seek from floor to rafter

For bein' cold and blind and weak
They would tell you that it's only
That I have a stubborn streak

If these old fashioned window panes were eyes
I guess they would have seen it all
Each little tear and sigh and footfall
And every dream that we came to seek or followed after

And sighs change to sweet love that never dies

if you're still within the sound of my voice. 

In the dead of night, do you hear me call? 
Somethings quite not right, no ones there at all 
Did you make a mistake? Was it in your head? 
Was it really me talking to your heart instead? 

And if you are still within the sound of my voice 
watching this video, I just want you to know 
That it always made me rejoice 
Just to have you so near 
There's a place for you here 
If you're still within the sound of my voice. 

I am calling like the echo of a passing train the cries 
one last time before it fades into the distant hills and dies 
I am sending out a message like a ship out on the sea in distress 
but only you can send a lifeline out to me. 

Are you still within the sound of my voice? 
Why don't you let me know I just can't let know if it's wrong 
then I have no choice but to love you until I no longer have a will 
Are you still within the sound of my voice 

I am calling like the echo of a passing train that cries 
One last time before it fades into the distant hills and dies",Still Within The Sound Of My Voice
Jimmy Webb,"The end has come and found us here
With our toys scattered all around us here
The puzzle that we never found an answer for
Still asks us, darlin', just what all the games were for
And here we stand in a box of sand
Where's the playground Susie?
You're the one who's supposed to know her way around
Where's the playground Susie
If I don't stay around?
If I don't stay around?
The carousel has stopped us here
It twirled a time or two and then it dropped us here
And still you're not content with something about me
But what merry-go-round can you ride without me
To take your hand
How would you stand?
Where's the playground Susie
If I decide to let you go and play around?
Where's the playground Susie
If I don't stay around?

Jimmy Weinstein,"I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, 
The chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning' sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon

And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you",I'll Be Seeing You
Jimmy Weinstein,"Laura is the face in the misty lights.
Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,
That you can never quite recall.

And you see Laura on a train that is passing through.
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura
Jimmy Weinstein,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April
Jimmy White,"Steven I never knew you, I only know your name
And even though its not your fault, pal
There’s only you to blame
If you hadn’t died that day, I never would’ve met her
You two would be married now, and I wouldn’t be cryin’
Tryin’ to forget her

[Chorus]
She was born to be with you
You were born to die too young
I was born to fall in love
With a girl too badly stung
How was I to know?
This was a hopeless romance
I never stood
A ghost of a chance

If you can’t accept the past, you’ll never want the new
Her heart’s still buried with you there
Sometimes Steve, can you believe it buddy
I wish I were you

[Chorus]

Steve, I know, you wouldn’t want it this way
Is there nothing I can do?
Do you know someone to whom I can pray?
To break through the fear
Her eyes showed so clear
On the day that she told me she loved me
Like she loved you

I never stood, a ghost of a chance",Ghost of a Chance

Purring softly as I hold him tight
Lying so that I can’t move

He’s getting older I need to worry more
He’s getting cranky, his legs are very sore
He needs more attention now
Cause time is unkind
But I don’t mind
Good friends are hard to find

By the door he’s waiting
In his eyes I see
The love he’s stating
He follows me onto that favorite chair
It’s filled with hair
I don’t care

Walking through my legs is his favorite game
And when I call, “Smoke” answers to his name
And when he goes, I know I’ll never be the same

Cause a piece of this heart will forever die
And both of these eyes will forever cry
But Smokerboy even this
Even this
I don’t mind
Cause if God gave me the chance
To never have known you,
To never have loved you
The offer would be
Between you and me
Politely, but firmly, declined
Cause good friends and best friends
And any kind of love at all in this crazy world
In this crazy world
Is just too hard to find
Do not go gentle my friend",Good Friends Are Hard to Find [Single Version]
Jimmy White,"Deep in your gut, twisted in knots
Anxiety is all that you’ve got
There in your chest
The hole that you see
Down in the place
Where your heart used to be

You don’t smile anymore
In your anger
Through your tears
You make a vow

Next time for sure, next time
You’re gonna hold on to your heart

You’re useless for now, your mind is a waste
All you can do is picture her face
You think of it now
How it used to be
Tortured by scenes
In your heart’s memory

It’s not like that anymore
You draw the contrast
You feel the knife
You make a vow

Next time for sure, next time
You’re gonna hold on to your heart

He doesn’t want to look insecure
But you’ve gotta let him know girl
If you want to be sure
That he knows you really love him
So if you want to make sure he won’t go

[Chorus]
A man needs to know
That you’re his woman
You need to show
That you care
So if you don’t want him to think
You don’t care if he stays or goes
A man needs to know

He keeps it inside
He’s afraid to show he’s got needs
But if you cut him through the heart girl
Believe me baby, he bleeds
He needs to hear you tell him
Even though he may never say so

[Chorus]

You can take him or leave him, you can leave him alone
But don’t cry that he should have known

A man needs to know that you’re his woman

I see no way, out tonight
I try to plead, in my defense
But I put it all together
And there’s no evidence

All the doors are locked, all the keys are gone
All alone out here, I’m just hanging on
All the paths are blocked, what was once so clear
There’s no exit, out of here
I can’t see no exit
So let me go

The wanderer, cannot allow
That Dion sings, gospel now
The jury pleads in my defense
But the verdict is my own

And I can’t believe that its you I see
Though my eyes, they swear that its so

Happy times from a collage
Of memories, so far away
I can’t find one
That resembles you today

And I can’t believe that its you I see
Though my eyes, they swear that its so

That I didn’t even see you leave
I don’t know, the answer is lost
In a past I can’t retrieve

You just wanna be good friends
But every time that we’re together
That’s how it begins
But not how it ends

You can deny that we fit like a glove
You can lie about what you’re dreamin’ of
You can try to kid yourself, endlessly
But baby it sure feels like love
To me

You say you don’t think you should love me
Cause you’re been hurt too many times before
But all the games you might have lost, baby
Still don’t change this one’s score
You say I don’t understand you
You just don’t think that anyone could
But all I don’t understand is
Your acting so bad when its feeling so good

Jimmy White,"Kimberly’s lovely, dressed all in white
She sits at the bar on a Saturday night
And waits for her boyfriend who comes when he can
Get away from the wife, who would not understand
Her smile and laughter can’t quite disguise
The bittersweet sadness I see in her eyes
The days become weeks and weeks become years
And harden the heart to a place beyond tears

[Chorus]
Kimberly, its better to be alone
Cause nothing’s free, but at least what you’ve got
You can call your own
Kimberly, it just seems to me
That you are what you choose
You’ll be what you’ll be
You’re too good for this
Be true to yourself

Kimberly’s lonely, dressed all in white
Alone in the bed that he visits at night
Sometimes he stays, but mostly he goes
And if she ever cries, nobody knows
The truth is the truth, and in your heart it will stay
You know you can’t change it Kimmie, by turning away
By selling your soul, by trading your pride
Before you know it baby,
There’s nothing left inside

[Chorus]

It’s none of my business this isn’t my heart
But it’s not for a song, and this isn’t just art
You could be my sister you could be my friend
You could be more
Than your self imposed
Dead end

Its better to be alone",To Kimberly
Jimmy White,"She looks so good and she loves me better
She owns me now cause I wanna let her
I love her big, big, big, big time
She stops my heart, on a dime, on a dime
So afraid that I’m gonna lose her, cause I want her oh so bad
She just laughs and says “ now honey,
 I’m the surest thing that you ever had”

[Chorus]
You’re stuck with me, boy don’t you know
I ain’t ever gonna let you go
You’re stuck with me and that’s no lie
I ain’t ever gonna say goodbye
Honey, you better get it through your head
You’re struck with me, until you’re dead

She loves it up and she loves it down
She loves to shake it, round and round
She loves it morning, noon, and night
She loves it loose and she loves it when it’s tight, when it’s tight
So afraid that she’s gonna flake, and she’s gonna set me free
She just laughs and says “now honey,
There’s just two sure things,
Death and me”

[Chorus]

Holding her sleeping alone in the night,
Whispered “I love you’s” into the moonlight
Like a heart beating
I know she’s waiting for me
I want her to go, but I need her to stay
Softly she’s breathing, it’s so far away

Cause I hear her say

It’s so clear in my head and so hard for my heart
I, will love you all my life, I know you love me too
And that’s when I feel the knife

You, your love needs to roam
And my love needs you home
Your love needs, so much space
But my love needs to see
Your face

I, I reach to hold you tight,
But again you disappear, into the lonely night
I, I know the reasons why
But it doesn’t seem to help
Hold back these tears I cry

You, your love plays defense
And mine’s so damn intense
Your love needs a hiding place
But my love needs to see
Your face

You run again, I don’t know where or why
There’s only so much pain love can justify
And I can’t say, we’ll ever lose this dream
But can you stop a train
When she’s built up so much steam

You, your love needs the space
And you, your love needs a hiding place
And your love disappears sometimes, without a trace
But in any case
My love needs to see
Right in front of me
My love needs to see 

Looks like rain
Feels like rain
Surely looks like rain

Or are those just the tears

That I want to

And I know that it’s for real

You make me want to change my life
You make me want to turn around
And call it lost, at any cost
And call you found
You make me want to love you more
Then anything I’ve done before
I only want to hold you tight
Each and every night
You make me want to change my life

I thought that my life was set
But you showed me that it wasn’t yet
Now I’m up in the air
But I don’t really care
Cause I’m crazy as a man can be
For you, and the thought of you loving me
Now I’ve got to know
Baby should I stay
Or should I go

You make me want to

Jimmy White,"Met her in a sleazy club, much too late one night
She was dancing to a song, underneath a flashing light

And I ain’t got over it yet

You think there’s certain places you find a lover
And then there’s certain places you don’t
So I never gave her a second thought
She said “don’t bother”, I said “I won’t”
Well I don’t feel quite so above her now
But she’s gone, so what can I do
Others come-others go
But Katy they don’t do it like you

When love was all that mattered
And hope was at calling at the door
I wanna go back, with a brand new start
When life was an adventure
And love was

How much do I have, how much do I make
How long can I eat it and still have the cake
How long ‘til I realize that I’ve become a fake
I hope its not too late
I am powerful until I finally die
I am confident until I ask but why
I am full of shit, until I finally just cry
When I realize my state
Is what I used to hate

When love was all that mattered
And hope was at calling at the door
I wanna go back, with a brand new start

You told me that it was only air
You knew I didn’t have a clue, I couldn’t get a bead on you
You positively said, He wasn’t there

I was fallen out of heaven, into hell 

I had to brake the fall, turn this round
Get my feet planted on the ground
I had to brake the fall

Looked to the moon, looked to the sun
Into the soul of everyone, I couldn’t find the thing you took away
You promised love but you gave me hate
And left me to a bitter fate
And stuck me with a bill I couldn’t pay
And I almost took a dive, but God kept me alive
And I saw there was only one way to survive

I’m tryin’ to fight,
I’m doin’ the best I can
But she’s some kind of 
Goddess
I’m just a man

Can’t get a handle,  
Can’t get a grip 
I’m a train about to derail 
A quickly sinking ship
Ain’t got no money 
I’m down to my last friend
What used to taste like honey
Has now come to a bitter end

I’m tryin’ to fight,
I’m doin’ the best I can
But she’s some kind of 
Goddess
I’m just a man

I’m bound to lose 
Ain’t gonna win
I’m hangin’ by a rope 
That’s wearin’ mighty thin
It’s too late for me man
This cannot be undone
But if you ever meet a goddess, brother
Turn around and run

I’m tryin’ to fight,
I’m doin’ the best I can
But she’s some kind of 
Goddess
I’m just a man",Goddess
Jimmy White,"Ooh baby you look so good
Just like a model from Hollywood
Picture perfect 
With a guarantee
To make a first class fool out of me

My heart’s been takin’ 
A hard ride
Nobody can see on the inside
There’s only one thing 
That I ain’t tried
And that’s being alone
That’s being alone

You’re the same solution 
That I’ve used before
The latest, greatest 
Gonna give me more
But every savior, I must confess
Has cost me more 
And loved me less

CHORUS 2

I’m feeling my heart 
Grow cold and still
As all of my fears 
Overwhelm my will
I think that you could be 
The one for me
But do I have the energy?
Is it still inside of me?
‘Cause my heart’s been takin’ 
A hard ride

CHORUS 3",Hard Ride
Jimmy White,"We all meet stormy weather 

And we are all, in this life together
Everyone can come to the dance
Everyone deserves to have a chance
She was a person who fought to the end
A daughter sister mother wife and devoted friend
There wasn’t anything , Amy wouldn’t give
She would have wanted you, to have a chance to live

So come all, and so come one
For every battle lost, there’s a war yet to be won
Her spirit lives, so very near
In the heart of forever
She’s still here

In the name of love, the heart breaks
In the name of life, for all our sakes
We share and we care
We fight what’s so unfair
Stealing heaven from the grasp of hell
Your offered hand
Lifts yourself as well

[Chorus]

Love, live, fight, give, speak , hear
In the tenderness of fingertips

That brush away a tear
In the heart of forever, she’s still here",The Heart of Forever (Amy's Song)
Jimmy White,"The first time I saw you there 
I couldn’t help but stop and stare
My heart would know you anywhere
And follow you
Although we hadn’t spoken yet 
I loved you long before we met
And the dream that I could not forget
Had just come true

You were where I had to be 
You were all my eyes could see
I couldn’t even think 
But still I knew
My heart in its heart always had
It’s heart set on you

So tired from the race I’ve run,
But now I know I’ve finally won
Like a flower aching for the sun, 
That just broke through

CHORUS

Pain can be a mirror to the soul
And diamonds come from pressure on
What was once
An ugly piece of coal",Heart Set On You
Jimmy White,"I only call you when I’m drunk
That’s why I call you every night
I only call you when I’m lit
Is it only then I see the light?
Am I braver when I’m drunk
Are you cuter when I drink
Am I dumber when I’m sober?
These are the stupid things I think

Maybe I’m a modern man
Just too cool to be involved
But the wine dissolves my defenses
And unleashes longings unresolved

Do you only answer when you’re drunk?
Oh, do you have longings too?
I only call you when I’m drunk
That’s my compliment to you

Does the wine make it really me
Does the beer make it really you
Does the mode of transportation matter
If the destination’s true?

I only call you when I’m drunk
You only answer when you are too
Do we only love when we’re both drunk?
I don’t know, 
I hope you do",I Only Call You When I'm Drunk
Jimmy White,"Almost every moment, 
A starving person dies
In the midst of our abundance
Do we even realize?
I am among the guilty 
I could do so much more
And so I make this pledge today
Of what I’m living for

I wish you peace, I wish you love
I wish you blessings from above
We can try to make this world a kinder place
There is a lot that we can do
If we make our minds up to
All the loss and tears and pain 
That seek release
I wish you peace

We don’t need a miracle 
Or a magic wand
One step forward gets you help
Power from beyond
God will always help us, 
Relieve our brother’s pain
He helps us build a rainbow
From our brother’s rain
   
I wish you peace, I wish you love
I wish you blessings from above
We can try to make this world a kinder place
There is a lot that we can do
If we make our minds up to
All the loss and tears and pain 
That seek release
I wish you peace

I don’t have the answers
For those I look above
But every time I ask, I hear
Its love
It all leads back to love 

I wish you peace",I Wish You Peace
Jimmy White,"I know you’re happy, when I’m away
In the illusion that you’re free
I know my love, just how you feel
‘Cause it’s the same way for me
The trust is gone and we can’t talk
Despite the countless times I’ve prayed
Now the pain of leaving 
Is less than
If I stayed

There were once, so many good times
They overwhelmed the bad
But somewhere, somehow the balance changed
Into tears over what we had
The smile’s gone, into a frown
And I’ve got nothing left to trade
Now the pain of leaving is less than
If I stayed

Who knows, where love goes
Can you name the time, or the place?
And I would swear
That I don’t care
But then why are these tears 
Upon my face?

In the heartache, I see a ghost
Another life too late to save
And so I write this, for the love that once lived
Like putting flowers on a grave
You look like someone I used to know
Who shared a promise we betrayed
Once the pain of leaving
Was less than 
If I stayed",If I Stayed
Jimmy White,"You came, when I 
Was so low I really 
Didn’t, think I’d 
Last another day
But you, took me, 
Out of my depression
And showed me a much better way

Loving you is where I wanna be
The best thing that ever happened to me
Was when she left and made room for you
Oh its plain to see
You’re just what I need

It’s not, that you’re 
Just a substitution
Cause no one has ever 
Made me feel this good
But if I had 
Never hit the bottom
Then I’d never know that you could

Loving you is where I wanna be
The best thing that ever happened to me
Was when she left and made room for you
Oh its plain to see
You’re just what I need

(You’re just what I)
Need to be strong, 
What I need to get by
What I need here beside me
‘Til the day that I die

Loving you is where I wanna be
The best thing that ever happened to me
Was when she left and made room for you

You’re just what I need

Oh it’s plain to see, you’re just what I   
Oh it’s plain to see, you’re just what I  
Oh it’s plain to see, you’re just what I    
You’re just what I need",Just What I Need
Jimmy White,"I cursed, I prayed
I tried to go, but stayed
I tried to show it 
Who was boss
Ah but in the end
I could not defend
Against the loss
Against the loss

I tried, I cried
I felt like I almost died
There was a line
I wouldn’t cross
So I grit my teeth
And was crushed beneath
Helpless against the loss
Against the loss

Every failure is a promise
Of the final time
Our victories cannot save us
From the final crime
It strips us of our dignity
It strips us of our pride
People look with sympathy
At the one who died

I yelled, I screamed
I groped and hoped and dreamed
And begged to be excused at any cost
But it’s all sour grapes
'Cause none of us escapes
From the loss
From the loss",The Loss
Jimmy White,"Time, trains passing by, in the blink of an eye	
I’m left grasping at air	
I’d walk a million hard miles, to see one of your smiles
And lay my soul bare

I lay me down at night to pray
In a dream that cannot stay
I see your face so far away
In a midnight prayer

Lost, in a cloud drifting on, in a moment it’s gone
Still I’m in the same place
Trains, from the stations they go, mine’s the wrong one I know
Cause I can’t see your face

[Chorus]

Reaching for what I have missed
Lips that I have never kissed
I do not care for open doors
Unless this one, 
Unless this one is yours

I lay me down at night to pray
Another midnight prayer",Midnight Prayer
Jimmy White,"Every choice, every word, every promise broken
Every kindness, every deed, never ever done
Every truth, every lie, every sentence spoken
Every battle lost, every battle won
Every love, every hate, every vow forever
Every pettiness and judgement, harsh or fair
All remembered in a place, you can sell it
You can keep it, you can save it, if you care

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Is there someone here at all?
Mirror, mirror can you see
The soul I’ve left inside of me
(Mirror, mirror can you see)
The soul I’ve left inside of me
(Mirror, mirror look at me)

Every day, every year, each and every minute
Every second ever silent as they come and go
We can fill it, we can thrill it, we can still it
We can kill it

All that really matters

Jimmy White,"We all make mistakes from time to time
Everybody’s human and it ain’t no crime
Just pick yourself up, no matter how you feel
Forget about it baby
It ain’t no big deal

When you’re on the top it’s a fantasy
You’ll soon be on the bottom, take it from me
Life is always neutral, and that’s always real
So forget about it baby
It ain’t no big deal

Pain is an illusion too
It wants to drain the life out of you
But if you stay with it you’ll make it through
And you’ll see, you’re free

Failure and success are the same old storm
A picture of a fire won’t keep you warm
Their opinions are nothing, only facts are real
So forget about it baby
It ain’t no big deal

Repeat Bridge and Verse",No Big Deal
Jimmy White,"Darkness with the light 
Blindness with the sight 
Wrongness with the right 
Disabling my will to action
Sadness from the wasted 
Precious moments tasted 
Copied cut and pasted, 
Aching for some satisfaction
 
And I hear the siren calling 
All my defenses stalling
And my fear 
That keeps me falling
So far 
So far behind

Hands offered seeming nice 
But once I took it twice 
I had to pay the price 
A blank check on all that I owned
Love comes seeming real 
But it’s not what I feel
It’s just part of a deal, 
Where I can’t pay back 
What I was loaned

[Chorus]

Is it forever, feeling my feet
Stuck in a past amassed 
Of concrete?
Do I have the strength, 
Do I have the time
Or am I just the victim 
Of the perfect crime

Now I’m… 
So far behind

I’ve been looking all my life
Always on my own

Truth I’ve ever known
Everything I’ve ever wanted
Is right there in your smile

But with you I’m a mile

I want to hold your hand at night
Walking down the street

I want you and I need you, but I must be needed too

Left my burro to check the market price
And I walked into the nearest barroom

There the crowd was gay and girls were dancin'
And the men were playin' cards and dice
So I stepped up to the bar to join them
What a grand place this Fool's Paradise

It was then I showed to them your picture
I passed it around once or twice
Then a man insulted your sweet honour
At the bar of the Fool's Paradise

So I slapped his face and I told him, I says
""You eat them words Mister, or draw, that's my advice""

I heard a maid sing in the valley below
""Oh don't deceive me, Oh never leave me,
How could you use, a poor maiden so?""

Remember the vows that you made to me truly
Remember how tenderly you nestled close to me
Gay is the garland, fresh are the roses
I've culled from the garden to bind over thee.

Here I now wander alone as I wonder
Why did you leave me to sigh and complain
I ask of the roses, why should I be forsaken,
Why must I here in sorrow remain?

Through yonder grove, by the spring that is running
There you and I have so merrily played,
Kissing and courting and gently sporting
Oh, my innocent heart you've betrayed

How could you slight so a pretty girl who loves you
A pretty girl who loves you so dearly and warm?
Though love's folly is surely but a fancy,
Still it should prove to me sweeter than your scorn.

Soon you will meet with another pretty maiden
Some pretty maiden, you'll court her for a while;
Thus ever ranging, turning and changing
Always seeking for a girl that is new.

Thus sang the maiden, her sorrows bewailing
Thus sang the poor maid in the valley below

Rub it on her body like body shop lotion

And the battle of the gun is gonna make you speak another language

And pork fried rice and throw dice

Get lost in town, end up in the lost n' found
Eyewitnesses, you must be crazy
We don't speak English, we speak Chinese

Every time they harass me, I want to explode

Jin,"Dumb dumb dumb, another day at work
Man...where the heck are my keys?
I can't be late for work again
It's bad enough I don't get any tips
There they go

Before I was even in the source trying to get 5 mics
I made deliveries for extra duck sauce and fried rice
For about 5 nights outta' the week
I pulled up to peoples houses and hopped outta my jeep
That shit was hard work... but hey, no pain no gain
I runnin' red lights to make sure they have hot lo mein
This ain't dominos... 30 minutes or less
You should be impressed if I even show up at your address
Customers got me stressed... constantly complainin
Tellin' me to turn down that loud music that I'm playin'
Whatever happened to tippin'? see these folks are strange
9.99 give me a 10 and tell keep the change
A whole penny for me, that's some shit
24 more deliveries and I can buy a whole bag of chips
Just the thought of it is making me sick
Hold up, let me take this order real quick

[jin]Hello, house of china how can I help you sir?
[man on phone]Yeah I want to order me ah... spare ribs... and ah... give me a quarter of friedrice
[jin]Ok, would you like to try today's special sir?
[man on phone]No I don't want to try anybody's special
[jin]It's very good very good
[man on phone]No special I'm good, I just want my freakin' food
[jin]What's your address sir?
[man on phone]Ah... 1474 mockingbird lane
[jin]Ok be there in about 30 mins, thank you very much...
[man on phone]Yeah... make it snappy

So after I take the order I put it in the kitchen
And you them chinese chefs they always be bitchin'
Screamin' n' yellin', tryin' to play me like I'm dumb 
Shut yo ass up and keep cookin' that egg foo yung
Finally the food is done and I'm ready to dip
Grab the two bags of grub and head for the whip
Put the key in the ignition and I step on the gas
My pockets kind of swollen and they filled with cash
I pull up to the house, the shit doesn't look safe
Double checked the address make sure I'm the in right place
Yup 1474, I see it on the door
Got out of the whip almost slipped on dog shit on the floor (eeewww)
Something smells fishy 'bout the whole situation
All of a sudden I feel my heart beat racin'
I ring the bell and patiently I'm waitin'
When the door opened up, two shotguns is what I'm facin' (oh shit!)

I can't believe this shit just happened
Me Jin, a victim of a jackin'
I don't know what was wrong with these dudes
They just robbed me for some chinese food
I don't know what was on their minds
I guess they where goin' through hard times
I guess they were some hungry dudes
Cause the just robbed me for some chinese food

Imma' make a run for it, if I get the chance
Starin' down the barrel, shit I almost pissed my pants
It was two guys, one short and one a lil' shorter
I recognize his voice the shorter one placed the order
Either I was dreamin' or I smoked some bomb weed
Two midgets with shotguns were about to rob me
Now I'm nervous as hell that's not a surprise
Its like I saw my whole life flash in front of my eyes
I'm thinkin' about my future wife and kids
The only thing on their minds is the rice and ribs
See the funny thing is they don't want me cash at all
They just said give up the food and that was all
Call the cops... why would I? I don't want to be on the news 
A guy gets dropped by two midgets for some chinese food
So if you make deliveries for the price of rice
And if you see two midgets you better run for your life

I can't believe this shit just happened
Me Jin, a victim of a jackin'
I don't know what was wrong with these dudes
They just robbed me for some chinese food
I don't know what was on their minds
I guess they where goin' through hard times
I guess they were some hungry dudes
Cause the just robbed me for some chinese food

Jin,"Yeah, uh, yeah

[Verse 1]
You at my welcome mat and I ain't mad by letting you in
Long as you listen to me closely as you get to know Jin
First of all I had the thirst of all rappers combined
Worst of all people told me I was wasting my time
Like I was better off making up computer designs
A doctor, a lawyer, or anything that's using my mind
When I used to rap I usually got refused and declined
Till I felt abused and used it as fuel in my rhymes
In every battle, the race card was my downfall
Till I read the Art of War and used it to clown y'all
I'm still battling but on a different note
Not rappers, but labels, same ocean but a different boat
Them CEOs must be sniffin' coke
Don't they know that I'm the dopest product on either coast?
They tried to drown me, but I stayed afloat
Here's a verse for you to quote
The realest shit I ever wrote

[Chorus]
C'MON!
Now that I got your attention I gotta say this
I know that it's been debated I'm a gimmick they created
C'MON!
All the people that hated because I made it, two-faced
When they the same ones that wished that I'd make it
C'MON!
All the critics that's jealous that I've created
Still highly anticipated they nothing to do but face it
C'MON!
Even though that I'm asian we all related be patient
Cause we gon' make it so if you rollin' with me

[Verse 2]
We together now, we ain't gotta act like strangers
I done let you into the deepest and darkest chambers
Introduced you to Jin, all the pain and anguish
Gave you reasons why they say the fame will change us
It's most common amongst entertainers
Rappers and athletes, how can you blame us?
Runnin' round crazy, saying I ain't the same cause
But jealousy, is a funny thing that the brain does
How can you not see, in simple and plain view
My fame ain't changed me, man it changed you
But then again I guess that's what haters do
And it's a damn shame my fans got haters too
It's like the listen, and disregard the lyrics
Imagine if they flipped it and the artist were the critic
And everything YOU did was under the scope
And YOU'S about to get hung, and we the ones with the rope

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
If you think about it, me and you, we really the same
Ain't nothin' different about us but the faces and names
The places we came, lies that were placed in our brains
If our ancestors knew they'd be disgraced and ashamed
So I chose to be the one to change the pace of the game
Look at me, hot as California burnin' in flames
Still I feel, that everything I earn is in vein
Unless I do somethin' positive with what I obtain
These people must truly think I'm really insane
Like my life around me revolves around the jewellery and dames
I'm quick to rip that picture right up outta the frame
I ain't tryna see my whole life go down the drain
And be, 40 years old still hoppin' the train
Frontin' with a fake smile like I'm doin' my thang
Hurting inside, tuck in my pride, hide in my pain
If you've never settled for less then you feelin' the same

[Chorus]",C'mon
Jin,"[Verse 1]
You can't help of the way that flow
When he leave the club ladies be like, ""did you see which way did he go?""
That will wraps a coop out from a radio though
When my single drop I'ma charge 80 a show
If you droppin' with me you ready for a pitfall
When my shit hit stores I'm charge a ?
Man, I'm tryin' to cop my toys in too
And stay away from the boys in blue
Just 'cause I'm gettin' dough the beast are made at me
But these cops are jokes like ""Police Academy""
Too much stress and I ain't blew up yet
When the 7 tring to the lax got you upset
I never stress over a chick I'm slick like blue balls
If I was Papa' Smurf you couldn't give me blue balls
Big dick playa, rip through balls
Balls so large they couldn't fit into jars

Yo, this my club song this my club song
Everybody got one so I had to make a club song

Throw your hands high, reach for the sky for my piece of the pie
I'm a beast I ain't speakin' no lie
I'm freakily hot, freak a bunch of freaks in back of the Jeep
Hope on reachin' to speak
I put 'em to sleep, ain't no reason to speak
Way I creep got 'em say; ""Gotta leave in a week""
Poof, be gone - I won't miss you at all
Not ain't sayin' I did you wrong; I ain't ditch you at all
Got a passion-o for gassin' hos
Live my life like everyday is a fashion show
I ain't playin', you know what I'm sayin'?
I wasn't talkin' about your IQ when I told you to give me some brain
Fam, you better play your part
'Cause your girl, she about to have a change of heart
When I come through find me in the cut like a stitch
Chick get wild up 'cause (I'M RICH JAMES BIATCH)

Only tunnel I've been to is a Harley and a Lincoln
Problem when I'm drinkin'; I get tipsy easy
Leave the bartender a hundred-dollar tip; leave me

Since she sale of it I say, ""Cool, I don't be buy of it""

[HOOK] 
See I don't want to hold a grudge so I cruise fast in my Cadillac 
My momma would be so disgusted if she knew the way these grown folks stack 
See I won't let them cram my style no and I won't let them hold me down no 
Tell her that I'm ok tell her that imma make a way somehow 

AY Yo Jin! You Double are bust guns 
I ain't about that shit 
Trouble just comes my way, I don't invite that shit 
I got a career here, I ain't looking for fights to pick 
Got more pain in my heart that I knew can exist 
Like that night, they pull the guns out and bang my man 
I was like fuck rap, I almost had a change of plans 
He took a bullet for me, how I'm gonna repay that man 
What if he woulda die, what I'm soppose to say to his fam 
The life I chose endanger all my family and friends 
Some shit I wish I could change but yet promise I can't 
People are killed to get to the position I'm at 
Only to die and heard to find out it ain't worth that 
Still wanna rap?

See I don't want to hold a grudge so I cruise fast in my Cadillac

(thats how they getting down) 
Two turn table and a rapper that was that was

20 young mans with there gats up 
Gotta travel like that or they'll try to attack us 
(that how they getting down) 
The great settle their beef with rap battles lets go 
(that was how they did it then, this is how they do it now) 
If they ain't better then you, now they shooting at you 
Know it sound tragic but hey you know 
(that how they getting down) 
So what I'm soppose to do? keep 20 bodyguards 
And a large entourage, cause everybody's hard 
Sometimes I wonder what happen to love and respect 
All I see now is haterd and death

And wherever you see us we gon' kick it, its all love (now I)
Get high get low

You in the club wit some some worldwide thugs
And wherever you see us we gon' kick it, its all love

Now ma whole set get love
I'm in the Chi two steppin wit them thugs
And big man you can search all you want
But you ain't gon' find no drugs or no guns
Yea why'all can get weeded up, beated up
But don't eat it up this ain't a slow jam so I can speed it up (lets go)
I ain't sparkin a meadow
I jus want to talk to the ghetto
Bag the baddest chick with the sharpest stilettos
I'm so influential, you so impotential
Man you gon' know what I'm workin wit
When I hold it against you
Destination vip you can follow us
But if it was the last sip well jus follow us
Shorty feelin my style because I'm humourous
Put me on cloud nine and its accumulous
Assume its us Jin, mista quick to diss ya
And Twista spit so fast ya lips'll blista

[Chorus: repeat 2X]

[Verse 2: Twista]
When I come in the party betta get high
'cause I pulled up in the platinum seven six five
Who say lyrical niggaz don't know how to party
See me jackin up shawtys wit a grippin on her thick thighs
I like the way she workin that badunkadunk
Bouncin the fatty when the base go bump
She witness how Twista spit it
So now she want me to hit it
'cause I'm blazin up the booth and raisin up the roof
I'm in the vip sippin on Cris' and Henn'
All the ladies is trippin 'cause they can't get in
They see me ballin wit the Ruff Ryder homie
And say they only drink liqour nigga but now they want some Jin
Everywhere we kick it we got the club sold
International hustlas that travel the globe
Rockin the thugs makin hoes keep it live
It's the Double are connect and that nigga Twista from Chi
I'm fly

[Chorus]
[Verse 3: Jin]
We can definitely kick it
I don't want to just stick it
If bein fine was a crime well I'd havta write you up a ticket
If you dance for me its sign jus like a picket
And I got two middle fingaz for all you critics
Never you in this someone so clever who spit this
I'm only here for one night so I mix some pleasure with business
Every few minutes

Take a dutch break it in half and fill it up with some pot

I got this part right here

From the start to the finish Imma bark on contenders
Wanna tarnish my image I can't promise forgiveness
See I was never like this my moms would never like this
And y'all was never like us that's why y'all never liked us
See I might take ya style flip it back make it crack
Sell a couple mil get some stacks here you go now take it back
I'm spittin lines of fire I'm in the line of fire
Designer attire makin me a sign of desire
I just rhyme to inspire ya favorite line supplier 
I run through fan signs and landmines the size of tires
How many minds inquire I got mines and acquired
Enough props to make y'all resign and retire

That won't make no sense at all
This for my dons and divas haters and non believers
They just tryin to deceive us like Judas dishonored Jesus
Why you tryin to critique this
Don't take kindness for weakness leave you behind the speakers
Body minus some pieces
You got records to sell I got records to break
You will never excel against me measure the rate
I got too much at stake I just follow my fate

Wanna know what my slang bout they be like
Shut yo damn mouth
Ya chances are slim makin advances on Jin
While you shootin the breeze I'm dancin with the wind
This is not ya ordinary my style sorta varies
Slaughter you than ya crew cause you know
The more the merry
You already know the outcome so how come
You doubt son I'm goin out by any means necessary Malcolm
Hiphop without Jin is like shootouts with guns
Churches without nuns bankers without funds
Smokin without lungs cities without slums
My fans force me

Jin,"About they never talked about the guns or the drugs
'Til I saw the guns and the drugs
There is tons in the hood
I'll admit, I never sold a sack in my life

Watchin' ""Scarface"" thinkin' that was a life
Slingin' dope or coke, respect, money and power
But what happen when things start to go sour
Everybody want to see more cash

But ego's clashin', that's when egos crash
See the two of them started when they was in dimes
Graduated, now they movin' bricks at a time
Down to do whatever even wet up cops

Tryin' to build an empire so they shut up shop
They got themselves a connect ready to tie it down
A buster went from Philly straight to China town
Now there is dough's poorin' heads thinkin' it's the same

All of a sudden there is weak link in the chain
He's a 6""2, brawler cat -- nickname Bolo
Caught beef with his man so he had to go dolo
But that was a no no

You know the code of the streets; everybody gotta eat
And that's how shit in the hood be
Ain't sayin' it's a true story, but it could be
For the next three months Bolo is nowhere to be found

They say 'cause of the beef that's why he left town
And everybody knows why they don't get along
He's a greedy bastard - stole half a meal from Fom
Fom is the quiet type, silent and deadly

You play with his money now he's violent and ready
They was partners - betrayed by his own man
So he really gotta take action into his own hands
Father forgive me for the sins I commit
But when I see that thief again, that's it

[Chorus]
The good, the bad, things can get ugly
Every hustler over this money thinkin' what it should be
Never know who, when, where, what could be
If you still alive then you'll probably understood me

Meanwhile across town in a two bedroom apartment
Bolo's going through it, baby mama through it
All that dumb shit he be puttin' her though
Disappear for three months plus he hittin' her too

Now she got her bags pack then she ready to bounce
Didn't leave a thing - not even the keys to the house
Let her leave, he ain't talk with her at all
Went straight for the safe behind the portrait on the wall

He's back for his jewels, that 'n the cash
Plus the sale of last few bricks he had in his stash
Get his money right then he leavin' again
Off to find a new life and start breathin' again

So the deal was made and the buyers agreed
And exchanged - they bring what the suppliers would need
Pick a spot in China Town uncle Lenny used to own
Dollar bills on the wall respectfully known

Bolo went by himself even though it seem risky
Wanted the whole cake - somethin' smell fishy
Back in the kitchen the money was waitin'
Deep in his heart he knew he was dancin' with Satan

Dress in all back with gats - this ain't part of the deal
Had a me set a mouth for the kill
Startin' lettin' off shots now just a few here
Sounded like firecrackers durin' Chinese new years

Bolo's big as a truck I don't know how they missed him
But they got so close the bullet stay there and kissed 'em
Grabbed the suitcase threw a table at the goons
Jump out a shattered window not a moment too soon

The thugs follow and he sprayed up his ride
Cut up from the glass but he made it alive
Now he's back at the crib frankly they say at least
He was just being chased by thugs and the police

Countin' his dough sittin' on the couch' in
Two shots to the back of the head now he slouch' in
Fom tried to get him at the spot, couldn't then
So he paid his baby ma' 50 Gs' to let him in
Damn

Jin,"[Verse 1]
Look I'm not a gimmick it's not a rapper I'm tryin' to mimic
My life move about a mile a minute make the best of it while I'm in it
Talk shit I'll never get offended I'm so pushin' to the limit
I can shake off 20 haters - ignore 'em and handle my business
Highly hood got my name cement in
A treat to every rapper in the game or that seven up in it
5"" 6, but I stand tall
Built for war, sort of like Great Wall of China
Hear my footsteps like Yao Ming's behind'cha
Don't remind me, do whatever to you, fly back and there'd be
Hell on earth for you to find me
They say we all look alike, cook alike
But they ain't know that we all crooks alike
I changed the game when I took the mic
In freestyle what it took for you to write

[Hook]
I am here now say what you want
I know I got something you want
I am here now think what you want
This is my life let's get it on

[Verse 2]
It's like the curse bein' successful
The more progress the more stressful
Don't ask about heart, I got a chest full
Throw into a cesspool of sex juice
So my next move is to elevate for the best view
I got a few things to confess too
They say I'm famous, I don't feel special
Plucked from a few to be placed on a pedal stool
Only to be ridiculed and find out they want to get rid of you
Once you in a pinnacle they try to limit you
From the start of your career until when they finish you
That's why in interviews I keep my shit in minimal
And if I do say somethin' is a subliminal
Is it because I'm signed with killers and criminals?
It's pitiful; this rap game is too political
But fuck it, I ain't got shit else to do

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
y'all, y'all
You ain't gotta give me my respect, I'ma take it
You gotta punch me in tonight, I'ma lay it
You gotta loan me no money, I'ma make it
And I'll do anythin' that I can get away with
I say what I want, take it how you take it
Media hype that I've created has enhanced my hatred
I came from the basement, rolls among the stars like a space ship
Face it, there is no replacement
Time you spent lookin' for the one is time wasted
I'm too defined, my design you can't trace it
So, give it up I ain't bitter but
I'm sick enough to take my contract and rip it up
Plus my friends say I'm forgettin' stuff
Is it 'cause I failed to get in touched while I'm out rappin, travelin', 
gettin' bucks
And my hearts in my Miami indeed
Oh I ain't forget, I just got my family to feed

Jin,"Yo Jin, we good wit this one. 

Good looking Kanye.
You see, we the next generation of this rap game
So it's only right we got down like this

Yep! Uh oh

You've never been no good for me
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with
2x

Yo I was doing a show with Kanye in the West
Mid that is so basically the Chi M.I. is up in the mix
We in the game now it makes perfect sense
The kid that dropped outta college the other never went
We take turns doing our one twos and yes yes y'alls
Look at shorty with my name tatted on her breast y'all
Mr. West what do you think is the best?
(take em backstage get acquainted that's what I suggest dawg)
When it comes to spittin G I'm one of the best y'all
She looks good smell clean and she had fresh draws
Naw that's too good to be
Usually them type of chicks ain't good for me no!

I gota love that's better than you ever was
You've never been no good for me
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with

I gota way with words I use words in ways
That convince birds to come out they cage and play
Polly want a Gucci Parka ma what did you say?
Polly might get a cracker ain't no trickin today hey
But anyway though she got it on smash like mashed potatoes
High class with a ass that'll smash on J. Lo
Lay low got play dough stash the payroll
Ain't no credit card spendin cash on Rodeo
And me I'm at the Slausson swap meet
Lookin for a pair of air one's and white tee
She want champagne I got sisco and cool-aid
Why go to the movies let's watch the bootleg

I gota love that's better than you ever was
You've never been no good for me
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with
2x

girl I don't wear Prada never met Gucci
Or wore versake (versace) y'all is too boughi
We all know Kanye is Mr. Louis Vuitton
But if I see a L and a V I think that it's on
That's what my old chick used to clash with me
(Jin why'd you get this fake Louis bag for me?)
Actually you should be happy I purchased that
I take this as a sign you don't want the matching hat
Huh I'm too gutter you more Parkay with yours
I'm more I can't believe it's not butter
What the other suckas do for love is a damn shame
I got a new significant other cause plans change

I gota love that's better than you ever was
You've never been no good for me
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with

Jin,"It's from the heart
It's from the heart right here (yeah)
Everybody has a story to tell
Check this out though

I knew this chinese dude in Junior High
Part of my crew, everybody knew the kid
He was the talk of the school, intelligent
And well spoken, respected by teachers
All the other students kept their eyes on his sneakers
What can I say? You can tell he's cool if you talk with him
During fire drills girls would want to walk with him
He could have any chick up in his view
But there was only one girl he wanted to call boo
See its all true, found himself stressed in a dead end
The girl he was feelin was obsessed with his bestfriend
His bestfriends a playa, that's the reason he's pissed
Plus he treat her like she don't even exist
He ain't tryna hate on his man, but there was no help in it
Wrote the girl a letter told her how he felt in it
She was shocked at first of him revealing the truth
Till she realized that she was feelin him too

[Chorus]
Oh
I've been thinking of you
Oh
I've been thinking of you
Oh
I've been thinking of you
Oh
I've been thinking of you

And you've been thinkin of me

Oh

Uh
So you know as time goes by
Things get a little bit serious
Just listen

It was strictly hip hop, now they bumpin slow jams all day
Went from holding hands, to makin out in the hallway
Their relationship, seemed like a dream come true
As time went by their friendship grew
Staring at the stars, trading secrets on the phone
When her parents were at work, she would sneak him in her room
He told her he was a virgin the day that they met

So on his birthday he got a gift he'll never forget
Females were jealous, but they still calling him cute
First day of summer school, they rocked the matching nautica suits
Happy in each others arms, can it be
They found true love, living in a fantasy
Then reality attacks, his pops couldn't see past the fact
His son was asian, but his girlfriend was black
Imagine having to choose between the one that you love or your fam
That's like cutting off your right or left hand, damn

[Chorus]

Uh huh, yeah

I know this sounds like a true story
Coulda happened to any one of us
It's crazy though right?

Now if this sounds like a true story
That's probably cause it is
And I know for a fact cause I'm that chinese kid
Mm, lookin back now, I know its more than just a crush
I'm sayin the whole expierience taught me so much
Love can overcome anything that gets in its way
That's reason I still think of shorty 'til this day
We talk now and then, she's doin her thing
We both full grown up, I think she rockin a ring
I know she's proud of me and all the things I've accomplished
She was there when I was nobody, that's being honest
Ain't no shame, I'll admit it she was there when I cried
So in return I wipe the tears from her eyes
As far as my pops, he's a little more open minded
If his son is happy, he's 100% behind it
Now this is a song I know I had to do
Cause all the stuff I went through might have happened to you

[Chorus]

Oh

Uh, yeah

Everybody remembers their first love
You only get one
So you gotta remember
Yeah
Uh
I just want you to know
That Jin's still thinkin about you",Love Story
Jin,"We may look different but we see the same sky
We may see different but we cry the same cry

To wake up daily and sleep better nights
That's what we all wish for to seek a better life right?
It's unfortunate when tragedy strikes
But the truth is reality bites
June 4th '89 a day residents feared
Now known as the massacre at Tienamen Square
The day I turned seven they were mourning and grieving
Thousands of innocent died for what they believed in
Armed with nothing but heart and a point to prove
Stood in front of tanks and refused to move
What would you do? run or stand still
When a lifes on the line and they test a man's will
Seeking change and they found it but in death
Strangers yet they were my blood and flesh
This happened in China but you ain't gotta be Asian to relate
To the struggle pain and heartache so

You'll never know you'll never get it
There is no choice we can't forget it
When we look up we see the same sky
When we look up we cry the very same cry

See I'm a grown man
It hurts when I turn on the news and see what's going on in my homeland
The SARS epidemic could have been lies
Could it stand for should Asians really survive
They'll try anything to break your family apart
Politics'll break down the manliest heart
Can the child within my heart rise above?
If there's a billion of us I shouldn't have to look for love
Over-population but damn just the meet the needs
It's illegal to have more than one seed
How can you dictate birth regardless to women
And the parents they make the hardest decisions
Sons keep the family name so that's not an option
Imagine being forced to put your daughter for adoption
And even though its beyond your control
Keep your head up here's a song for your soul

You'll never know you'll never get it
There is no choice we can't forget it
When we look up we see the same sky
When we look up we cry the very same cry

If you don't know where you came from
You can't get to where you trying to go
Ain't no denying so
It's true I got some big shoes to fill
But if I don't lead the movement than who will?
Stuck between a rock and a hard place
Thinkin' bout the refugees that went to see God's face
Sixteen-thousand miles across the ocean tides
Some died some got lucky and survived
I wouldn't call it luck they reached the destination
Modern day slavery without the plantation
Them sneakers on your feet cost a hundred a pop
My people's making fifteen cents a day and sweat shots
To make them kicks so you can look good
You think we open restaurants 'cause we cook good?
Hell no we ain't got no choice
I gotta speak up without me my people have no voice

You'll never know you'll never get it
There is no choice we can't forget it
When we look up we see the same sky
When we look up we cry the very same cry",Same Cry

You in it for the check or you in it for respect (both)
I'm try to get both and not feel to connect (yeah)
With each one of y'all so my sales are direct
And me not try to sound all righteous (nah)
I know a lot of y'all gotta feel just like this (yeah yeah)

Jin,"This feels good right here.. Just happy to be here. I mean, I gota take a moment to thank those that made a difference..whether small or big. Damn, where should I start though?

First and foremost I gota give praise
To the lord above and his almighty ways
Blessin me with the gift to lift spirits
And evoke emotions through these words everytime you hear it
I got the lyrics and flow I'm capable so
When I blow just know this ones for April and Joe
Me and my little sister we grateful you know
Wish I could see you more Avah at the rate that you grow
My favorite uncle Franky for opening ya door
When I ain't have a place to stay I crashed on your floor
Taught me the basic survival tools
Auntie Cathy every summer kept me in vacation Bible school
Mr Diskin for more than passin grades
And my fourth grade teacher mr Scott who passed away
Peep how I met Kamel corner on the street
We goin to the top lets do it for Shawna and Jaleek
In the beginnin no one was on Jins side folks
Bar and Amory whoa bundy that's a inside joke
Before bullshit friendships synthetic for cream
Chilled with my wall click Bryan Cedric and Jean
So when I moved to ny chose to invest in a few
One love to Patricia Ben and the rest of the crew
To be loved is a privilidge that's what I was told
A gem from my man LS more precious than gold
Infamous joe lacin my tatt so sick
Fong YungMac and Ken down at ho yips
To dee waah chivon and the rest of the Deans
For believing in a young man obsessed with a dream
Allowin me to write history create my own chapter
All original ryders and the generation after
The double are staff my thanks worth a million
And the whole 30th floor at the Universal buildin
You could never walk in my shoes or stand in my boots
Know how I came up I'll never abandon my roots
Yeah see rayz poison pen for sharing the stage
Shouts to stronghold tone and the rest of the plague
Ask big zoo we ten steps ahed of ya
Vice versus eye to eye e-o dub regulars
My man j pure for bringin the heat right
And the rest of the poets chillin under streetlights
Just keep the beats tight shouts to the record spinners
Enuff felli fell and all the heavy hitters
Kubichi k sly hold me down in La
Might catch me flickin it up with Von in the bay
Then its off to the wake up show with tech and sway
Or big nat and foot out in VA
Its damn near tradition to kick a freestyle
Anytime I'm with Eddie Francis out in seatown
Can't forget hometeam as high as I be
Supacindy big lip and Dj irie
The club and mixtape djs that break records
Cause thanks to them we've heard some great records
Shouts out to the technitions they get props
Feel free to holla anytime you need drops
Bob collina the only one to call 
Anytime ya boy Jin gota run in with the law
Bert Padell aka big babe ruth
Got the brinks truck outside lets get paid loot
Six four six six the trips back and forth
From the studio to the crib I'm never slackin off
How bout will spivey and of course killa kai
Boondo randy feron just a few of my
Close associates that I love to see 
School me to the game like joe box and brother e
Razor and Mario for all them times we rocked shows
To the rest of 176 tato
Holla front.com go register to day
Peter jun rock lisa landy and j
Keepin me fresh ellis at the barbershop
Coast to coast lifestyles reppin the are a lot
My man cartoon bringin the fresh sound
Cookie and mag ogs holdin the west down
And of course swizz blocks carl climax
Far east movement they got what ya minds lack
T dot montreal where I keep mass appeal
Romero baby yu rg and neal
It pays to keep it real even more to be sincere
Thanks to BET for jump startin my career
As for 106 who they askin about
Free and AJ can't wait to see y'all back on the couch
And MTV for givin advance warnings
John singleton plus the chance at performin
The source double xl rolling stone vibe
The truth the lies the layout in rides
For every write up forever in context
King magazine elle girl and complex
To all the producers for providin the beats
Shouts to neo tunehedz divine and elite
JR wyclef kanye can I rep
This is real hiphop be damned if I let
Y'all tell me otherwise cause we so live
This ones for 954 and 305
All the way to 718 and 212
And if you ever showed love this ones for you
But I gota say thanks even those that hated
Cause cause y'all kept me motivated

I gota thank God I wanna thank y'all
I gota thank God I wanna thank y'all

Tonight we're gonna try something a little different.

This is not an exclusive, so pardon me
As I get on my Posdu new shit
You know them stakes is high I can't relate to guys
That create disguise-is
Exaggerate how great they pies is
Is that a pizza or lemon merengue
You ain't slangin a thang, play guerilla
But you ain't even orang and a tang
I hang with a gang, we ride til we die
Preferably ride yessire I professor M-I
CNN for information, order now
And get free installion, oops
You're a flow too late, I got the flow of two lakes
Ontario and Michigan
That means great for every rap fan listenin
Soon you will be seein and you will be agreein
Even though I'm Chinese I do a show for the Koreans cause
I'm so dope and my flow so tight
I could turn Karaoke to Open Mic Night
(right)
4x

[Styles P.]
Why don't you try to Karaoke this verse
Is the nigga with a whole bunch of birds and don't none
Of them chirp
Ten ways to calm down and don't none of them work
I go bezerk with a gun in my shirt
Blow a hundred of earth, pastor said don't come to the church
I'm a problem when it come to the work
Listen if its a race to split ya face
I'll be comin in first
I show up niggas wonder who I'm comin to murk
Got my broad in the corner gun under the skirt
And we lookin at ya jewels, tryin to wonder the worth
Gettin slayed at night, take away the ice
Cause its sorta like sprite, how we obey our thirst
Shoulda known you seen both of the are's
Ghost come with the toast, Jin came with the Chinese stars
You can catch me downtown at a Chinese bar
Dai-ma like a motherfucker high off la' wha..
I'm so dope and my flow so tight
I could turn Karaoke to Open Mic Night

[Jin]
Simply put I limp with a pimpery foot
And that's just how its meant to be took
Or taken, I hate the pigs
But I got fam out in Frisco that's my bay-kin
See how that works a beat
And the perks of bein a jerk
Me and styles P leave you deep in the dirt
Peek in ya hears whisper in ya ear freakin a verse
While the deacons speakin a church
Oh lord
I'm so dope and my flow so tight

And the emcee back at it again..
Its the G.O.L.D.E.N
And the emcee back at it again..

lets take it back to the basics..
'cause face it..
Nowadays its all about the beats..
Lyrics are wasted..
Simple minds get nothing at all..
I'm saying what do'ya think the rewind button is for...
If I was your A&R every verse be the kind..
You're a grown man, why you kicking nursery rhymes..
Fooling the public with the rubbish you create..
Hoping they won't notice it beneath the AO8s..
Its a shame that your tactics are affected..
It seems like listeners are not as selected..
Djz, drop this and let it blast..
Bet you anything the first question they gon ask...

is that a neptune track, uh uh, uh uh..
Is that a timbaland track, uh uh, uh uh..
I'm saying who did that..
I'm saying who did that..

its the G.O.L.D.E.N

Its the G.O.L.D.E.N
And the emcee back at it again..

I can rhyme on fast beats so ones that tell us slow..
Better yet no beat check the acapella flow..
You got beats for the streets, beats for the clubs
Beats for the ladies, beats for the thugs..
Top 40 beats get it across the nation..
Underground beats don't make it pass college stations..
Some beats are worldwide, other beats are local..
Most beats aren't even hot until I lay my vocals..
I got love for this self, they holding it down the day..
But don't these crunk beats all sorta sound the same..
Don't care where its from, long as the shits hot..
I need a beat, the 5th element of hip hop..

is that a neptune track, uh uh, uh uh..
Is that a timbaland track, uh uh, uh uh..
I'm saying who did that..

Its the G.O.L.D.E.N
And the emcee back at it again..

pre got the shit sonicly mastered...
That's why his 1st album the cronics was a classic..
Hip hop is pre most drum kicks..
Resalace 36 chambers with karate flicks..
Swizz is known bang on the MP..
But the beat prolly get your ass banned from tv..
Havocs like give up the goods or he gon take it..
Alcumus came through on some we gon make it..
I bet bow wow didn't even know..
When the role beat drops everybody wanna flow..
Kanye got some classics under his belt,
But since he started rhyming he keep his shit to himself..
Wish I had the budget to get up with just blaze..
Prolly cause a couple grand just to use the phrase..
Sometimes you just wanna to hear street knock..
A little bit of night wonder maybe some beat rock..
Get a many fresh bit if I ever start blinging..
Or mario winans if I ever start singing..
Psyke... but biggup to all your producers..
Mark my work, golden child is the future..

Action packed nigga get your cassettes ready
It's about to go down like this here

Uh, uh, these niggas keep hatin', that ain't right though
I'ma throw it down like this here

Now I ain't trying to take over the game
I'm just trying to get a Range Rover and a couple of chains
I got a X-ed out college bitch giving me brains
Gave her my e-mail address and an alias name
And they tell me take it easy but I can't help it
I want more green than the Boston Celtics
Let a true nigga breathe don't be selfish
Bet on hot spitta competition getting dealt wit
Hollerin' bout you totin' guns
But I see you with no straps like low-top Air Force Ones
And you hollerin' bout money ain't got no funds
And you rappin' on beats using pots for ya drums
And you'll never see me with ya bitch
Oh I got the hoe with me, you just can't see through the tint
And I'm beggin' ya dog please don't quit rappin'
If you quit rappin' I quit laughin'

[Chorus: x2]
Don't want to see us with no paper ha (that ain't right)
Don't want to see us niggas make it ha (that ain't right)
I ain't gon call you a hater dog ('cause that ain't nice)
Just let a nigga breathe in the game aight

I got a flat so I had to leave the V in the garage
And X see the bar on his Bentley ??
Headin' to the spa for a weekly massage
Me, ya lady, and ya sister do minage trios
And I just copped two Porsches
And the dashboard got more wood than the Evergreen Forest
 
Pull up on the block, two glocks two torches
Shorty too hot like papa bear's poridge
Talkin' bout you pop caps to wet me
The only cap you pop is off a bottle of Pepsi
I got enough waves for you to ride on jet skis
And fuck a bodyguard I let the tech protect me
Hell in a black end male with white break lights
Known for spittin raps out like that on tapes right
Say you got skills ha bitch keep frontin'
And I'll carve ya face up like a Halloween Pumpkin

[Chorus]

I guess I ain't supposed to spit
You probably want me locked off in the back so you can hush my shit
You probably thinkin' is see wrong for this
But XL ain't just a name known for production and shit
If ain't nothing else, I'm never ya bitch
Lyrically I'm hot, like the different color paint on my six
And if y'all really ain't on my shit, it's cool
'Cause that ain't right
I guess I know you better than me
You probably a pimp who get the pussy wetter than me
You probably a thug with more ice and cheddar than me
Fuck that if i was you I'd be better than me
Ya bitch you, you better be better than me
You're probably right, that ain't right
Naw dog, not on your life
You're better off trying to fuck with a dike
If you smart why you sound so dumb on the mic
You can't fuck with my beats let alone what I write
My click, or the fact that we tight
It ain't us, y'all ain't doin' it right
I ruined it right
A producer that ruined your life
Aw fuck it they done gave me a mic

Silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore - Then
Suddenly, I see it all change
Long winter nights with the candles gleaming
Through it all your face that I adore.

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

The sun's in my heart and I'm ready for love

On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

since-a you been gone.
Now it's the same, same old song,

And wanna cry but the melody keeps haunting me 
reminding me how in love we used to be.

since-a you been gone.

ev'rytime I hear our favorite song, now you're gone, left this emptiness,

make romance to the music,

Never be the same again. 

I call you up whenever things go wrong.

To take the forbidden step. 
Is this something that I might regret?

From sidewalks to highways. 
See it'll never be the same again. 
What I'm sayin' 
My mind frame never changed 'til you came rearranged. 

But sometimes it seems completely forbidden. 
To discover those feelings that we kept so well hidden. 
Where there's no competition. 
And you render my condition. 
Though improbable it's not impossible. 
For a love that could be unstoppable. 

But wait. 
A fine line's between fate and destiny. 
Do you believe in the things that were just meant to be? 
When you tell me the stories of your quest for me. 
Picturesque is the picture you paint effortlessly. 

And as our energies mix and begin to multiply. 
Everyday situations, they start to simplify. 
So things will never be the same between you and I. 
We intertwined our life forces and now we're unified. 

I thought that we would just be friends. 
Things will never be the same again. 
It's just the beginning it's not the end. 
Things will never be the same again. 
It's not a secret anymore.

Jive Bunny & the Mastermixers,"All right
Come on
Can you fill me in (Let's talk about it)

I was checking this girl next door
When her parents went out
She phoned said, ""hey boy, come on right around""
So I knock at the door
You was standin' with a bottle of red wine, ready to pour
Dressed in long black satin and lace to the floor
So I went in, then we sat down start kissing, caressing
Told me about jacuzzi, sounded interesting
So we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answer phone
Please leave a message after the tone
I mean me and her parents were kind of cool
But they ran a fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to

Saying why were you creeping around late last night
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light
Now you're dressed in black
When I left you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in
Calls diverted to answer phone
Red wine bottle, half the contents gone
When I returned, Jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in

Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say, ""hey girl, come on right around""
So she knocked at the door
I was standing with the keys in my hand to the 4x4
Jumped in my ride, checkin' that nobody saw
The club we went in
We got down bounced bounced to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning
Thought we'd better be leavin'
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it 'cause you felt cold
I mean me and her didn't mean to break the rules
I weren't trying to play your mum and dad for fools
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to

Saying why can't you keep your promises no more
Say you'll be home by 12, come strolling in at 4
Out went the girls but leaving with the boy next door
Can you fill me in
Wearing a jacket, who's property
Said you'd been queuing for a taxi
But you left all your money on the TV
Can you fill me in

All they seem to do is be checking up on you baby
Watchin' our every move, think some day they might approve baby

Why were you creeping around late last night
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light
Now you're dressed in black
When I left you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in
Calls diverted to answer phone
Red wine bottle, half the contents gone
When I returned, Jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in",Fill Me In

I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand

Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

I was waiting all alone
Baby by myself I sit and wait and wonder about you
It's a dark and dreary night
Seems like nothing's going right
Won't you tell me honey how can I go on here without you?

Yes I'm down and feeling blue
And I don't know what to do, oh-oh

Ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
Ring, ring, the happiest sound of them all
Ring, ring, I stare at the phone on the wall
And I sit all alone impatiently
Won't you please understand the need in me
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?

You were here and now you're gone
Hey did I do something wrong?
I just can't believe that I could be so badly mistaken
Was it me or was it you?
Tell me, are we really through?
Won't you hear me cry and you will know that my heart is breaking

Please forgive and then forget
Or maybe darling better yet, oh-oh

Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.
The winner takes it all,
The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.

Oh yeah

Jive Bunny & the Mastermixers,"People say I'm the life of the party
Because I tell a joke or two
Although I might be laughing loud and hearty
Deep inside I'm blue
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place

If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you, need you
Since you left me if you see me with another girl
Seeming like I'm having fun
Although she may be cute

She's just a substitute
Because you're the permanent one
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

I need you, need you
Outside I'm masquerading
Inside my hope is fading
Just a clown oh yeah
Since you put me down
My smile is my make up

I wear since my break up with you
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears",The Tracks of My Tears
Jive Bunny & the Mastermixers,"Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight
I'm a poorman's son, from across the railroad tracks
The only shirt I own is hangin' on my back
But I'm the envy of every single guy 
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye
When we go out stepping on the town for a while 
My money's low and my suit's out of style
But it's all right if my clothes aren't new 
Out of sight because my heart is true
She says baby everything is alright, uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
I'm a pearl of a girl, I guess that's what you might say
I guess her folks brought her up that way
The right side of the tracks, she was born and raised 
In a great big old house, full of butlers and maids
No one is better than I, I know I'm just an average guy
No football hero or smooth Don Juan
Got empty pockets, you see I'm a poorman's son
She says give her the things that money can buy 
But I'll never, never make my baby cry
And it's all right, what I can't do
Out of sight because my heart is true
She says baby ev'rything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, ah ah ah ah
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight",Uptight (Everything's Alright)
Jive Bunny & the Mastermixers,"As I walk this land with broken dreams
I have visions of many things.
Love's happiness is just an illusion filled with sadness and confusion.
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
 
Maybe, the fruits of love grow all around 
but for me they come a tumblin' down.
Ev'ry day heartaches grow a little stronger;
I can't stand this pain much longer.
I walk in shadows, searching for light,
cold and alone, no comfort in sight.
Hoping and prayin' for 
Someone to care, always movin' and goin' nowhere.
 
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
Maybe, I'm searching though I don't succeed,
but someone look, there's a growing need.
Oh, he is lost, there's no place for beginning;
all that's left is an unhappy ending.
 
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
I'll be searching ev'rywhere just find someone to care.
I'll be looking ev'ry day;
I know I'm gonna find a way.
Nothing's gonna stop me now;
I'll find a way some how.
I'll be searching ev'rywhere just find someone to care.
I'll be looking ev'ry day;
I know I'm gonna find a way.
Nothing's gonna stop me now;
I'll find a way some how.",What Becomes of the Brokenhearted
