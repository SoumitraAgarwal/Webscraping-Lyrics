Modest Mouse,"We have one chance.
One chance to get everything right.
We have one chance, one chance.
And if we're lucky we might.

My friends, my habits, my family,
They mean so much to me.
I just don't think that it's right.
I've seen so many ships sail in,
Just to head back out again and go off sinking.

I'm just a box in a cage. I'm just a box in a cage.
I'm just a box, just a box in a cage.
I'm just a box, just a box in a cage.
I'm just a box, just a box in a cage.
I'm just a box in a cage.

Didn't mean to laugh, didn't know I had.
Didn't know the better part of what you said
'cause in your head you are not home.

Didn't get the joke. Didn't mean to poke another,
Just to save myself
From some something something or another one.
Well walk home.

I'm just a box in a cage. I'm just a box in a cage.
I'm just a box, just a box in a cage.
I'm just a box in a cage.

I'm just a box, just a box in a cage.
I'm just a box, just a box in a cage.
I'm just a box in a cage.

We have one chance,
One chance to get everything right.
My friends, my habits, my family,
They mean so much to me.
I just don't think that it's right.
I've seen so many ships sail in,
Just to head back out again and go off sinking.",One Chance
Modest Mouse,"You were laying on the carpet
Like you're satin in a coffin.
You said, ""Do you believe what you're sayin'?""
Yeah right now, but not that often.

Are you dead or are you sleepin'?
Are you dead or are you sleepin'?
Are you dead or are you sleepin'?
God I sure hope you are dead.

Well you disappeared so often
Like you dissolved into coffee.
Are you here right now
Or are there probably fossils under your meat?

Are you dead or are you sleepin'?
Are you dead or are you sleepin'?
Are you dead or are you sleepin'?
God I sure hope you are dead.

Now the blow's been softened,
Since the air we breathe's our coffin.
Well now the blow's been softened,
Since the ocean is our coffin.
Often times you know our laughter
Is your coffin ever after.
And you know the blow's been softened,
Since the world is our coffin.
Well now the blow's been softened
Since we are our own damn coffins.
Well everybody's talkin' about their short lists.
Everybody's talkin' about death.

You were laying on the carpet
Like you're satin in a coffin.
You said, ""Do you believe what you're sayin'?""
Yeah right now, but not that often.

Are you dead or are you sleepin'?
Are you dead or are you sleepin'?
Are you dead or are you sleepin'?
God, I sure hope you are dead.",Satin in a Coffin

Modest Mouse,"Ice age, heat wave, can't complain
If the world's at large, why should I remain?
Walked away to another planet
Gonna find another place, maybe one I can stand
I move on to another day
To a whole new town with a whole new way
Went to the porch to have a thought
Got to the door and, again, I couldn't stop
You don't know where and you don't know when
But you still got your words and you got your friends
Walk along to another day
Work a little harder work another way
Well uh-uh, baby, I ain't got no plan
Well I float on, maybe would you understand?
Gonna float on, maybe would you understand?
Well I float on, maybe would you understand?

The days get shorter and the nights get cold
I like the autumn but this place is getting old
I pack up my belongings and I head for the coast
It might not be a lot but I feel like I'm making the most
The days get longer and the nights smell green
I guess it's not surprising but it's spring and I should leave

I like songs about drifters, books about the same
They both seem to make me feel a little less insane
Walked on off to another spot
I still haven't gotten anywhere that I want
Did I want love? Did I need to know?
Why does it always feel like I'm caught in an undertow?

The moths beat themselves to death against the lights
Adding their breeze to the summer nights
Outside water like air was gray
I didn't know what I had that day
Walk a little farther to another plan
You said that you did, but you didn't understand

I know that starting over's not what life's about
But my thoughts were so loud I couldn't hear my mouth
My thoughts were so loud, I couldn't hear my mouth

Here we go! 

Got dirt, got air, got water and I know you can carry on
Shrug off shortsighted false excitement and oh what can I say? 
Have one, have twenty more ""one mores"" and oh it does not relent

Modest Mouse,"Well!
Well!
Well!
Well!

We spun like birds on fire right down towards the residence and I
I took all that I desired, even crooks have to pay the rent.
We swam like rats on fire right, right down the reservoir
We took all that we could carry but we tried to carry more.

And you know you know you know it all went wrong.
And you know you know you know it was all wrong.

We choked on street tap water well I'm gonna have to try the real thing
I took your laugh by the collar and it knew not to swing.
Anytime I tried an honest job well the till had a hole and ha-ha
We laughed about payin' rent 'cause the county jails they're free.

And you know you know you know it all went wrong.
And you know you know you know it was all wrong.

Deep water, deep water
Senseless denial
I went down like a rag doll as you would, child
Deep water, deep water
Senseless denial
I went down like a rag doll as you would, child

Oh, lucky lucky lucky lucky me again.
I said it looks like I've got to use my feet again
Well I just spent my last one-hundred dollars
God I'll pay my bill again

Oh, I don't care
Oh, how I just don't care.

Deep water, deep water
Senseless denial
I went down like a rag doll shooken and shy
Deep water, deep water
Senseless denial
I went down like a rag doll rat of a child

Well King rat has me on his list again
I can never be on the fence again
I found out it's all loud
Open like an organ and it
Talk, talk, talk, talk again
He promised me that when I cheated him
But I could open my eye well

Lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky,
Lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky me again.

Deep water, deep water
This senseless denial
I got fed like a fish, full of open smiles
Blue water, deep water
Oh senseless denial
I got fed like a fish on the cardboard smiles

Well well
What do you have to say for yourself?
I said, well well
Well?
I said well, well, well, well!

Lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky me again.

Modest Mouse,"Call it education
It was somewhere in between
You gave me some sound advice
But I wasn't listening

After we had capsized
I could tell you how you thought
Well, I'm not sure
But laid to rest on the city on the wall

Not quite conversation
It was somewhere in between
You said everything is taught
And I listened patiently

All this talking pony
Still monkies the whole time
We could not help from flinging shit
In our modern suits and ties

Our instincts, they were cringing
About how we lived our lives
It didn't seem we'd lived enough
To even get to die

All these diss distractions
So beautifully complex
Well, I loved life's surprises so much
I don't want to know what's happened

Stubborn shouting, said
""I don't do what you do""
I don't know
Could it really hear highly if you highly care?
And you don't
Stubborn beauty, stubborn beauty
I've been away

Hardly education
It was somewhere in between
Oh, I hit the roof but I had
Aimed for the ceiling

Hardly education
All them books I didn't
They just sat there on my shelf
Looking much smarter than me

Good old Nostradamus
He knew the whole damn time
That always being east from west
Someone is there fighting

Stubborn shouting, said
""I don't do what you do""

Crashing down the mirrored stairways

Modest Mouse,"Although we often wondered
It was no thing of wonder
The shit that flew from our minds
Grass stains and fresh fruit
Reminds our shoes of horse glue
On this ridiculous climb
With great tall vision
We built ourselves a mission
To ride out motives decide
Oh, with vague description
Of what we have been missing
So why would anyone try?

It was always worth it
That's the part I seem to hide
And the busy ant empire

First off, Gary was on trial, and drunk before we left bed
As things got better, was it hard to say that he had no idea?
Well, I hadn't noticed but the people really noticed that they really didn't want us around
So, we all just opened up our mouths and walked to this town
Well, I was walking just a little bit sideways, and you were walking sideways too
Well, I hadn't learned when a front door can be used
Here it goes now

We had darkened doors, so we didn't read what the sign read
Though simple enough, it was to me really tough; the ground needs to be fed
Well, I hadn't noticed, but the people really noticed that they didn't really want us around
So, not a single one of us will ever leave town
Here we go, sir

Our bodies were laid out
They were laid for fifteen yards
Well, two feet above each of our heads was a fly trapped in a jar

And we'd already missed the plane

So we could shake, shake, shake, shake, shake

Tiny curtain's open, and we heard the tiny clap of little hands
A tiny man would tell a little joke, and get a tiny laugh from all the folks
Sitting, drifting around in bubbles, and thinking it was us that carried them
When we finally got it figured out, that we had truly missed the boat

Oh, and we carried it all so well
As if we got a new position
Oh, and we owned all the tools ourselves

I didn't bother looking to either side of me
Well I didn't see, I just didn't see
What was really going on

The truth had stopped and the skyline rose
Exchanging comfort for more fashionable clothes
I'd left the hills at this point in time
To run on treadmills in a perfect line

Sparked imagination until the sparks just quit
And if this is fun, why am I so bored with it?
Well I'll probably never know

Well we rolled over, how our masters clapped
It felt so good we wanted more than that
But when the program failed they defensively laughed

Didn't bite a face, no just a mask
So happy Halloween!

Well I guess I'll just have to play and play
Until I'm out of cash

Before I could spit it out
I guess the words had burnt my mouth
What can I say?

There's the thought I laid it down
So you could take it out of context

And mostly we knew that the supply would quit

Don't move in any direction
Wait until the light's inside of the cloud
You're gonna wanna see this
Don't bring your camera around
Watch sun and sawdust align

We greased all the roads
We're floating in the light
We're gonna break these borders
We're gonna pulse in time
We greased all the roads
We're floating in the light
We're gonna break these borders
We're gonna travel time

Hold up a window
All the air, all the air is falling out
Eyes vacuum up light
Sound gets trapped by the mouth
Our predecessor left this box
And something's clawing around
I think it really wants out","The Ground Walks, With Time in a Box"

Or pretty much the same (Now that's more like it)
From birth to grave, I couldn't see so clearly what I was or became
Oh, I missed a spot (Scrubba scrubba scrubba scrubba)
On my dirty thoughts
The way we feel about what we do is by who has watched us, so

Aw, how'd we get here?

Oh, what's the bother?

Modest Mouse,"I'd hate to be the shit in your cut
But the package is gonna be late
I buried it in an abandoned lot
When I was young this was where I'd played

Dug under the fence with my claws
Smelled the cool dirt on my face
I'm waiting till the hands fall off the clock
Spending dollars at the nickel arcade

I think I'll ride this winter out
I guess I'll ride this winter out

You echo from side to side
Pacing in your clumsy ballet
Based on the books and clothes on the floor
I don't think this is even your place

When the doctor finally showed up (oh boy!)
His fur was soaking wet
He said that ""this should do the trick""
We hadn't told him what the problem was yet
(Kaw kaw kaw kaw!)

We'll have to ride this winter out
This time we'll ride this winter out

With the strain and the comforting you know everyone needs to go
But don't everyone go, don't everyone go at once
Expulsion from an exoskeleton of our mothers we arrive
Soft sticky and cold we arrive and then start to cry

All those insects I that sent are trapped in my window once again
Empty their pockets out and I'll sort it at the table
Line 'em up then shoo 'em off
Sure as hell they'll all get caught in our window
Pockets full as they are able

The signs all flicker and buzz all night
Passing by you can hear them say
""Hey, please won't just come on in?
Won't you please just go away?""

We're lucky that we're so capable to forget
How lucky we are, that we are, so easy to forget
How often we become susceptible to regret
I do regret

And had been since time began
It knew the world through all its histories
And the universe and its mysteries
One day it came across a man
The two were talking

About the future and how the universe ran
Oh, the man killed the tortoise, took his shell

Take my handkerchief out and rub my eyeglasses clean
So I just learned my face, but I forgot my name
I'm gonna wear this smile like it's some stupid toupee
And say, ""Oh, oh, oh, oh, that's too bad""

Oh, I just learned your face, but it is bound to change
You can say what you want but try to think it my way
And say, ""Oh, oh, oh, this wicked campaign""
I said, ""Oh, oh, oh, this was not my plan""

Well, you know I'm a bastard and we only just met
I guess I probably shouldn't wear this big old sign 'round my neck
I've still got some opinions that I'm willing to claim
I'm gonna carry them around like they're some wicked campaign

I started the debate, but now I'm sure I can't win
I should probably just exit the same way I came in
Well counted calculator, you didn't calculate this
But there's a lot more nothing than you knew exists

Oh, oh, oh, this wicked campaign
I said, ""Oh, oh, oh, this was not my plan""
Oh, oh, oh, this wicked campaign
Every day is a wicked campaign

Well, I just found the fence where I am going to lean
Take my handkerchief out and rub my eyeglasses clean

And just wait
And just wait and wait, wait, wait

I'm not dead but I misplaced the will
I'm gonna wear this smile like it's a hundred dollar bill
And just wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait

I'm not a doctor, but I'll sell you an itch
I could apologize, but then a bit more nothing exists
So the worlds got plenty of good and bad liars
But our lies should come with chariots and choirs

Modestep,"Let's go back
Listen, power

Let's go back in a day
I'm talking back in a day
Before I used to MC
When D-Power D he was just a DJ
I was in the jungle vibe
Selling records from 9 to 5
I used to go old school
...
And skip a bus right then
I lost a vibe
Then UKG come alive
I'm talking munchie
Talking...
And then came one two three
And then came Wiley then came Dizzy Kano and D Double E
...
And grime is alive
It was hard but we still survived
I know music evolves through time but
I thank you Lord that grime still alive
And I bust the mic
Now I'm on lord of the mic
Now I've linked on with modestep
2012 is a whole next hype

Alright where do I start
Let me come back let me go from the start
My life without music is a thorn in the heart
This marriage could have end in the park
It's like taking tea from a shop
English way Jamaican herry
The rivals listening to Morgan Harage
UKJ hard ass crew
Beating of the drums
LIstening to ABBA
I knew like when it was like Jacobs
...
Bob Marley, Gwen Steffani James Brunt
For you they may hardly relate
But for me they're all in the same playground
And it all comes together like a rain and cold weather
This is my Darwin Theory
Not like humans and apes
It's more like ...
Then you got dubstep
Then party like a rockstar
A rockstar
Yeah, yeah

For as long as I remember
I've always had music on my agenda

But I still represent the sounds of the UK
Little bit of dubstep little bit of grime

Y puedo despertarla acariciando puntos clave
Así le robo el tiempo a los duendes
Que pueden observarla mientras duerme
Ella sabe, ella quiere, ella todo lo hace bien

Sus rizos al calor son como hechizos que me atrapan
Y mido los gemidos y quejidos que se escapan
Y así hago mío todo lo que siente
Soy cómplice cautivo y confidente

Ella sabe, ella quiere, ella todo lo hace bien
Pero no sabe que quiere y mucho menos a quien
Ella sabe, ella quiere, ella todo lo hace bien
Pero no sabe que quiere y mucho menos a quien

Jugamos, aunque a veces olvidamos que jugamos
Y se pierde por que sabe que me pierdo entre sus brazos

Waiting for you in vain (I've been waiting for you)

I've got to break my chains

No more tears to cry
Hope will free my mind

I can't understand
Why you want this to end
I know i got to take a stand
I'll never be some kind of friend

Hard times, I've had a few (I have had a few)
Tired of feeling blue (Sometimes I'm feeling blue)
I turn to someone new

Hope will free my mind
A new sun will rise
Love will make it shine

I've kissed my past goodbye
I know that love will dry my eyes
And God knows time is on my side

Pain, I've had my share (You know I've had my share of)
Waiting, you didn't care (I've been waiting for you)
And now, I've found myself
I've got to break my chains

When the one love you had left you hurting so bad
The world seems to fall apart, your life has turned into dark
But the sun will rise in somebody's loving eyes
It will light up your way, turning your night into day

Call me at home back in December of 1974
He sang me a song on the phone that he and D. Shafer written
And they called it a Bandy And A Rodeo Clown
I was really thrilled and flattered that he take enough time
To help write a song just for me
I'm sorry that he couldn't be around to see how much that song helped me
For he passed away in August of 1975 shortly after that song was released
It's a special song to me and I guess it always will be
Here's another song that I guess it's my favorite of all the songs he ever wrote
And I'd like to dedicate it to his memory and my mom and dad)

I'd walk for miles cry or smile for mama and daddy
I love them I want them to know
Now I feel my love is real for my mama and daddy
I want them to know I love them so

In my heart the joy tears start cause I'm happy
And I pray every day for mom and pappy and each night
I'd walk for miles cry or smile for my mama and daddy

Moe Bandy,"It's not working the way that I planned it
We're no closer than we were at the start
I can find my way to your body
But I can't find my way to your heart

Are we making love or just making friends
Are we holding each other or just holding hands
Is this the beginning or is this how it ends
Are we making love to just making friends

It's not easy when I'm laying beside you
Never knowing if you really care
Do you love me or do you just need me
Are we growing or going nowhere

Are we making love
Are we making love or just making friends",Are We Making Love or Just Making Friends
Moe Bandy,"It was mom and daddy's anniversary
You hugged my mom and kissed my daddy's hand
It had been three years since you left me
And it broke my heart to see you once again

Don't know how you knew I'd stopped drinking
But it was so good to kiss and hold the key
Now that seems so many eyes start crying
When you said darling will you marry me again

Then we all held each other tightly
As if we knew the world would surely end
Now that seems so many eyes stopped crying
When you said darling will you marry me again
Darling will you marry me again",Darling Will You Marry Me Again
Moe Bandy,"We're man and wife on paper but the things just ain't the same you
Lovers now are strangers how we've changed
It's the end of our forever and we just can't stay together
And I think it's time to break these paper chains

Paper chains can't hold us together
All we have in common is our name
Paper chains can't hold us forever
And I think it's time to break these paper chains

There's nothing left between us now that love has gone to pieces
Love that's lost is seldom found again
Why should we keep tryin' while our hearts are slowly dyin'
Don't you think it's time to break these paper chains

Paper chains can't hold us together
And I think it's time to break these paper chains",Paper Chains
Moe Bandy,"The old man used to dream of the fortune he'd seek
Now he lives in the room where you pay by the week
His hands're all bothered and his pony's gone lame
And his bones always ache when the sky looks like rain

Well he dreams of the old days with bronc bustin' tails
And the wide open spaces where buffalo plays
Deep in his mem'ry wild horses ride on
But he knows the good times have all come and gone

There's nobody home on the range anymore
They closed down the bunkhouse and had locked the door
Now there's oilwells and motels and folks by the score
But there's nobody home on the range anymore

Now the eagle stop flyin' the night wind is still
And the last cayou's hawlin' on some lonely hill
The old man is longin' to lay all down
In his final box canyon the poor side of town

'Cause he knows his last mantel is two flights two stairs
And his saddle's turned into an old rocking chair
Mornings he wakes up and wonders what for
'Cause there's nobody home on the range anymore

There's nobody home on the range anymore",There's Nobody Home on the Range Anymore
Moe Bandy,"Cold Fort Worth beer just ain't no good for jealous I try it night after night
You're in someone else's arms in Dallas does Fort Worth ever cross your mind

Darling while you're busy burning bridges burn one for me if you get time
Good memories don't fade so easy does Fort Worth ever cross your mind

You left me here to be with him in Dallas and I know it hurt you at the time
I wonder now if it makes a difference does Fort Worth ever cross your mind

Does Fort Worth ever cross your mind",Does Fort Worth Ever Cross Your Mind
Moe Bandy,"Well I've just left my home friends where I couldn't sleep
For missin' a man that I couldn't keep
She just walked out and left me for somebody else
Now her memory keeps haunting me but I'm by myself

So break out the bottle bring on the crowd
Tell funny stories turn the jukebox up loud
Come on sit at my table where the drinks're on me
Yes gather round me cause misery loves company

This is not the first time I lost everything
To a false hearted woman with a false hearted dream
But this is the first time I've suffered myself
Help me get over this love I'll handle the next love all by myself

So break out the bottle
Yes gather round me cause misery loves company",Misery Loves Company
Moe Bandy,"Well it really tears me up when I hear a hurtin' song
And I'm someone who likes a good cold beer
Baby's gone and after hurtin' all day long
My heart feels the need to come in here

'Cause I need soft lights and hard country music
Those cheatin' songs assure me that her leaving's real
I need soft lights and hard country music
A steel guitar in a dimly bar knows exactly how I feel

Well the tempo's up the lights're low and I'm a gettin' down
With that woman that I met in here last night
She's hurtin' like I am and we don't give a damn
So play that country music and keep it tight

Moe Bandy,"Well, you wouldn't read my letters if I wrote you
You asked me not to call you on the phone
There's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
Well, you left the only one who ever loved you
And I'm back here on the wild side of life

I'm only a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
And you left me here on the wild side of life",The Wild Side of Life
Moe Bandy,"Lord, I love to hear Hank Williams sing
And there's a lot of Lefty's now with different names
But it'll never be the way it was before
Take me back to yesterday once more

How I miss ole Tex, those days were good
And nobody else could sing like Jim Reeves could
Red Foley's Gospel songs touched my heart
Take me back to yesterday once more

When they sang, 'Your Cheatin' Heart'
It always made me ache
And there'll be peace in the valley someday
I knew 'Rye Whiskey', 'Four Walls' too near me
Take me back to yesterday once more

Johnny Horton sang a country song so fine
And there'll never be another Patsy Cline
And how I miss Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys
Take me back to yesterday once more

When they sang 'Your Cheatin' Heart'
It always made me ache
And there'll be 'Peace in the valley someday'
'North to Alaska' and 'San Antonio Rose'

Moe Bandy,"Every time I see your face it reminds me of the places we used to go.
But all I got is a photograph and I realize you're not coming back anymore.

I thought I'd make it the day you went away, 
but I can't make it till you come home again to stay.

I can't get used to living here, while my heart is broke, my tears, I cried for you.
I want you here to have and hold, as the years go by and we grow old and grey.

Now you're expecting me to live without you,

Goodbye, old Paint, I'm a-leavin' Cheyenne.

Moe Bandy,"I was hanging round town, just spending my time
Being out of a job and not earning a dime
A fellow walks up and he says, ""I suppose
You're a bronc rider, from the looks of your clothes""

""Well, you figured me right and I'm a good one, I claim
Would you happen to have any outlaws to tame?""
He says, ""I've got one and a good one to buck
At throwing top riders, he's had lots of luck""

He says this, here's one pony that's never been rode
And the man that gets on him is bound to get thrown
I got all heated up and I asked what he'd pay
To ride this old nag for a couple of days

Well, he offered me ten and I say, ""I'm your man
For the bronc isn't living that I couldn't fan""
He says, ""Get your saddle, I'll give you the chance""
So we hopped in his buckboard and rode to his ranch

Out in the horse corral, standing alone
Is an old Cavallo, a strawberry Roan
Little pin ears that touch at the tip
A big 44 brand upon his left hip

He was spavined all round and he had pigeon toes
Little pig eyes and a big Roman nose
You-necked and old, with a long lower jaw
You could tell at a glance, he's a regular outlaw

Well, I buckle on my spurs and I'm sure feeling fine
I pull down my hat and I pick up my twine
Throw my loop on him and well, I know then
Before he gets rode, I'll sure earn my ten

I get the blinds on him with a terrible fight
Next comes the saddle and I cinch him up tight
Then I step on him and raise up the blinds
""Get out of the way, boys, he's bound to unwind""

Well, I threw him his head and I'll say he unwound
He seemed to quit living down here on the ground
Went up in the east and come down in the west
I'm sitting up on him and doing my best

He sure was a frog-walker, he heaved a big sigh
He only lacked wings for to be on the fly
Turned his old belly right up to the sun
He sure was a sun fishing son of a gun

He's about the worst bucker I've seen on the range
He could turn on a nickel and give you some change
I lost both my stirrups and also my hat
I'm reaching for leather and blind as a bat

He come down on all fours and he went up on high
And he left me a-spinning up there in the sky
Turned over twice and I come down to the earth
And I lit into cussing the day of his birth

Now I know there's ponies that I cannot ride
There's some of them living, they haven't all died
But I'll bet my money there's no man alive
Who can stay with old Strawberry when he makes his high dive",Strawberry Roan
Moe Bandy,"The twilight shadows deepen into night, dear
The city lights are gleaming o'er the snow

And every day I hear you softly saying
""I'll wait until the springtime comes again""

I'll tell you of my troubles on the old Chisholm trail.

Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea,
Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea.

Oh, a ten-dollar hoss and a forty-dollar saddle,
And I'm goin' to punchin' Texas cattle.

Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea,
Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea.

And afore I sleep the moon shines bright.

And my durned old slicker's in the wagon again.

Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea,
Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea.

No chaps, no slicker, and it's pourin' down rain,
And I swear, by gosh, I'll never night-herd again.

Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea,
Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea.

Feet in the stirrups and seat in the saddle,
I hung and rattled with them long-horn cattle.

Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea,
Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea.

The wind commenced to blow, and the rain began to fall,
Hit looked, by grab, like we was goin' to lose 'em all.

Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea,
Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea.

I don't give a darn if they never do stop;
I'll ride as long as an eight-day clock.

Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea,
Come a ti yi yippee, come a ti yi yea.

We rounded 'em up and put 'em on the cars,

He had it figgered out I was nine dollars in the hole.

Goin' back home to see my honey.

We're all just hapless victims
Of knowledge and learning and such
The man you thought you licked 'em
But you choked in the clutch

It's an ethereal kind of flu
A Mac virus reveals the plot
Of the fiendish Fu Man Chu

Here's the whole truth
I know it's true
Made it up myself
And I impart it to you

It's not the drinking
Of the suds you partake
It's more the clinking
And the toast that you make
Time will show you where you are

Where did you go?
They stole your face
And you missed the show

moe.,"Day before my birthday me and my cousin Dave
Drove his truck down to the border
And we hitchhiked the rest of the way
Down through Mexico

In the beginning we didn't have much luck
So we took all our things up upon a bus
It cost us three dollars just to get half way
Down through Baja California

We spent the night in a cheap hotel
Fourteen dollars, didn't sleep so well
And the morning came with bells on
And I took to the road with my cousin
Down through Mexico

We hitched a ride from an old pickup
And climbed in with the chickens in the back of the truck
I got to Tijuana by the middle of the day
Just in time to celebrate my twenty-first birthday

[Chorus]
Well I'm a million miles away from home
And I can't find a telephone
My folks don't even know where I am
Hell I don't even know where I am

Well I'm a million miles away from home
And I can't find a telephone
My folks don't even know where I am
Hell I don't even know where I am

We got something to eat and then we took to the bars
A bottle of tequila and two fat cigars
We painted the town some sort of red
At some point a train drove through my head
Down in Mexico

Well at Five-AM we're still on our feet
A cop pulls over to the side of the street
He said something to me I couldn't understand
And threw me in the wagon, took the bottle from my hand

Well I'm still in the wagon at Six-AM
And I don't have a clue where I am
I don't speak Spanish all that well
I'm out of cash, and I'm drunk as hell

Me and my cousin Dave

And I can't find the way to the door

While I'm whiling away

I like getting stoned so hang out
And honey disconnect the phone
Well I've already gone

Rests a little gypsy moth, it got burned out from the war
It was a big one, the war that is, it was a Sunday afternoon
The gypsy was held prisoner by the screen door from the moon

Now somewhere between the dog food and the moth in the kitchen screen door

Now she knows everything about living

And the gypsy's liberation

It was a big one, the victory, and the sun gave way to the moon
Well we got drunk and she thanked me, and then we drank all afternoon

Pull out my swollen tongue

Looking too hard
One more regular beer before I go
Maybe two or five before I get back to my regular home

Scrutinize and undermine
Dip your hand in the bowl pick over the side

Pulling it's bone like heaven on ledge

Blood on the wall and the curtain and rug
Try to kill the flame with the moonshine jug

I'll be leaving the simple space
Just to be at a show
I get distracted by the simplest lines
I need to test my resolve
I got the symptoms and I'm watching the signs
My medication can’t solve
Every problem left on my front door
I ain't no Curious George
Marie Curie or Louis Pastuer
I never played at the Gorge

I can remember the warm summer nights
Driving so fast we were ran every red light
I can remember the feeling is gone away

Flying so high with my feet on the floor
But left my nerve on the ground
I made it this far using every back door
I had to find in the sound
Took a lover like some Parisian Count
Then you fell off the floor
Spending summers with your seniors' discount
Pay your dues and then a roll
Off trippin' at a rock n roll show
That's your problem my friend
Try slippin' past security though
I guess you're shutout again

Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes, Oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me

I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there

You're in control just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream, no end and no beginning
You're here with me, it's like a dream
Let the choir sing

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power

Dizzy with eternity
Paint it with a skin of sky, brush in some clouds and sea
Call it home for you and me

A peaceful place or so it looks from space
A closer look reveals the human race
Full of hope, full of grace is the human face
But afraid, we may lay our home to waste

There's a fear down here we can't forget, hasn't got a name just yet
Always awake, always around, singing ashes, ashes all fall down
Now watch as the ball revolves and the nightime calls
And again the hunt begins and again the bloodwind calls

By and by again, the morning sun will rise
The darkness never goes from some men's eyes
Well you know it strolls the sidewalks and it rolls the streets
Stalking turf, dividing up meat

Nightmare spook, piece of heat, it's you and me, you and me
Click, flashblade in ghetto night, Rudie's looking for a fight

Rat cat alley roll them bones, need that cash to feed that Jones
And the politicians throwing stones
Singing ashes, ashes all fall down

Commissars and pin-striped bosses role the dice
Any way they fall guess who gets to pay the price?
Money green or proletarian gray
Selling guns instead of food today

So the kids they dance, they shake their bones
While the politicians throwing stones
Singing ashes, ashes all fall down

Heartless powers try to tell us what to think
If the spirit's sleeping then the flesh is ink, yea
History's page, it is thusly carved in stone
The future's here, we are it, we are on our own
On our own, on our own, on our own

If the game is lost then we're all the same
No one left to place or take the blame
We will leave this place an empty stone
For that shinning ball we can call our home

So the kids they dance, they shake their bones
And the politicians, throwing stones
Singing ashes, ashes all fall down

Shipping powders back and forth
Singing, black goes South while white comes North
And the whole world full of petty wars
Singing I got mine and you got yours

And the current fashions set the pace
Lose your step, fall out of grace
And the radical he rant and rage
Singing someone got to turn the page

And the rich man in his summer home
Singing, just leave well enough alone
But his pants are down, his cover's blown
And the politicians are throwing stones

So the kids they dance and shake their bones
'Cause its all too clear we're on our own
Singing ashes, ashes all fall down
Singing ashes, ashes all fall down

Picture a bright blue ball just spinning, spinning free
It's dizzying, the possibilities
Ashes, ashes all fall down

Para abrir tu corazon

A mirar atrás

Quiero regresar a ese lienzo limpio
Que me viste manchar sin dar ningún aviso

Pero quiero adivinar que no me has olvidado

Yo pensé que con el tiempo podría dejarlo atrás
Pero en silencio todo se nota más

Dibujé siluetas hermosas

Ve como las cosas pierden gravedad
Pierden tamaño hasta que ya no están

Después de tener todo no sera bastante

Dime si a un año de aquí lo que hoy importa sigue así",Sin Gravedad

Un día que no lastime.
No tendré que preguntar por donde caminar.

Pero yo no diré nada.
Porque si alguna vez creí que nunca iba a salir
Ahora sé que ya no es asi.

Fueron tantas las mañanas sin luz en mi ventana
Mis ojos no podían verla.
Noche sin saber de sueño por miedo a no ser el dueño
De lo que pudiera ser.

Y voy curando las heridas de todas las cosas vividas.
Si otras veces me perdí queriendo escapar de aquí.
Ahora sé que ya no es asi.
Ahora sé que ya no es asi.",Ya No Es Asi

De alguien que ya no tiene nada que ofrecer

Pero nunca me he abierto como hoy
Todo lo bueno y lo malo es lo que soy

He aprendido de errores cometidos
Que lo mas grave es el miedo a intentar
Así te pido un día más conmigo
Que nos ofrezca otra oportunidad si

Que difícil es
Pedir perdón
Ni tu ni nadie, nadie
Puede cambiarme

Vete de aquí
No me supiste entender
Yo solo pienso en tu bien
No es necesario mentir

Que fácil es
Atormentarte después
Pero sobreviviré
Se que podré sobreviviré

Donde esta nuestro error
Sin solución
Fuiste tu el culpable
Oh, no fui yo

I walk through this abyss of consciousness

Surfaces in my mind
There must be a heart there

Soon noise will drown it out
Returning to the enveloped light
My voice raised, yearning to go back
White waves stop quietly
The song of the clouds breaking the surface 
Words of promise to the insane sunlight 
I gaze at the fragments of thought spread out at my feet
Tears of hope for those unfulfilled

To whom do the stars belong? 
Sometime this sadness will end
My heart's response will continue the story
Silhouettes reflected in my eyes:
Countless faint smiles lined up before me
Gazing towards the exit
This beloved landscape
A vision brings

An instant of whiteness and the palm of my hand
All exists within one stride

The bridge of the sky and the clamor of twilight

I extinguish my lamp, and in the moonlit street

""Further in the tape, I came across another part, 
That made me throw my headphones right off my head. 
I couldn't believe what I've heard. 
Led Zeppelin's ""Stairway To Heaven,"" again, 
Was voted the most popular tune of rock's history. 
Keep that in mind as I show this tape to exert with you. 
In the lyrics of the song, they sing, ""The piper is calling you to join him... 
She's buying her stairway to Heaven,"" we know that's not possible

This is where the subliminal message comes in 
That we've been talking about in the previous interview. 
The subliminal message is a Satanic message, that was put on their record in reverse

The needle'll go in the opposite direction. 
You say that I've never heard anything like that before. 
Probably not, but many, many people have. 
And this is what I'm talking about, you can only hear it a few more minutes

They sing backwards, in human voices. 
Satan. 
You gotta live for Satan. 
Master Satan. 
The message that they have altogether, 
That they wanted you to hear, in subliminal way, or in reverse, is this

Because I live, surely, there's no escaping it. 
Satan. 
We gotta live for Satan

You've heard of group after group who worship his singing, for Satan, 
They know He is real. 
God tells us He's not willing that any should perish, 
And that includes Mick Jagger and Alice Cooper, and all of the rock singers. 
Because they have a choice to make. 
What about you? What do you choose?""",Repelish
Mohair,"When my luck runs out
I'll be as busy as a bee
At home watching daytime tv
In my sole company

In my soul, just to fit in

Won't you fly
Don't let life's loves pass you by
You will die
This is the end of the line

When my ship comes in
I'll turn a blind eyei to the sea
Drinking wine feeling fine
Until closing time closes on me

Won't you fly
Don't let life's loves pass you by
You will die
This is the end of the line

I went to the water
To wash my hands
But they looked clean to me

We became lovers at first sight
Funny how a blink of an eye can turn your life around
Wanna spend every tomorrow
With you baby nothing is impossible
Fly you to the moon at the front row
There's no limit, let's go
Sometimes we simply fall out
But that don't change the fact
I'm tied to your love like heaven's chains
Always

If you go, I go
If you stay, I stay
When you cry I'll try to put a smile on your face
If you fall, we fall
I will hear you call
Always know that baby I am yours and you're
Mine, mine, mine
We're a match made in heaven
Mine, mine, mine

People turn around when we walk by
You is so fly from a bird's eye
We got the whole universe on our side
From the very first night
Every day we do is a love scene
We were born February the 14th
Baby you're the reason why I'm falling,
Never felt so right

Sometimes we simply fall out
But that don't change the fact
I'm tied to your love like heaven's chains
Always

If you go, I go
If you stay, I stay
When you cry I'll fight to put a smile on your face
If you fall, we fall
I will hear you call
Always know that baby I am yours and you're
Mine, mine, mine
We're a match made in heaven
Mine, mine, mine
We're a match made in heaven

When it's written in the stars
There's nothing that can take our love apart
You were sent from up above
That's the reason you beat in my heart
Oh baby

If you go, I go
If you stay, I stay
When you cry I'll fight to put a smile on your face
If you fall, we fall
I will hear you call
Always know that baby I am yours and you're

Taking more than you could ever say
Push come to shove
You kicked me in the head
You knock me down
I ripped the handle off again
I wanted more than this
Wanted more than this
Fade away fade away

Push just a little too late
Is this what you want
What you need
Is this what you wanted me to be
Always loved me strapped to you
Lock it down and drive me through

Hands gripped to the wheel
Held too tight to feel
Face pressed to the glass
Please don't ask
One breath one more
It's alright

I could give enough
Have enough
Be enough
You could never stand to stay there
Only only only
Fade away fade away

Push just a little too late
Is this what you want
What you need
Is this what you wanted me to be
Always loved me strapped to you
Lock it down and drive me through

Push just a little too late
I wanted more than this
I expected more than this",Push
Moist,"So, close your eyes
Your Christ has come
The crippled boy that you once knew
The charmed enigma
Chosen one with painted lips
Skin ripped and torn
Come touch and feel and lick and smell
This envy that I've worn so well
Everybody wants
Everybody says
Everybody begs in time

So drink me in
Like tainted wine
Come bite down on my sharpened cup
And taste the dreams that numb the mind
A simple word
A harmless glare
That binds me with the thinnest thread
And pins me down to pleasure's bed

Everybody wants
Everybody says
Everybody begs
In time

And you will be the first to fall
Every feeling will dissolve
We are silver
Morphine baby's final breath
Ever smothered to my chest
We are silver

So shy and poised with few regrets
A Judas kill
A complex thrill
A memory I won't soon forget
Been washed out clean till all runs dry
Come touch and feel and lick and smell
A hurt that only you could sell
Everybody wants
Everybody says
Everybody begs in time

And you will be the first to fall
Every feeling will dissolve
We are silver
Morphine baby's final breath
Smothered to my breast
We are silver

Trip sister I will follow you this time
Knowing I will follow you
Everybody wants
Everybody says
Everybody begs in time

And you will be the first to fall
Every feeling will dissolve
We are silver
Morphine baby's final breath
Ever smothered to your breast
We are silver, silver
(Silver) we are silver
Silver, silver
We are silver",Silver
Moist,"I came screaming down the highway
Looking for a place to fly
Stopped outside the window
It's only in the blood 

Into the kitchen
Found you lying on the floor
There I tied you up with wire
I can't feel you any more
You gave yourself to me
I offered you to god
Wrapped the curtains round your body
It's only in the blood 

This shrieking love
Comes crashing down
This shrieking love
Is not the one you thought you'd found
Oh it's only in the blood 

It's a deadly clear addiction
A bodies breath away
A long hot bath in acid fast
It's only in the blood
On down the highway
Looking for a place to fly
Outside the window
It's only in the blood 

This shrieking love
Comes crashing down

Come wage my holy war
Where every thought is sin
I've been meaning to remove my baby skin tattoo
And I meant to be more kind
Well maybe next time 

If you come my way
If you come my way
If you come my way
We might feel the same
Consequence of rage
If you come my way 

I caught you on the knees
My words aren't wasted
You'd love to be released without tasting it
And it's only if you bought what I have sold you
And if everything is fine well maybe next time 

If you come way
If you come my way
If you come my way
We might feel the same
Consequence is rage
If you come my way

And if we go quiet if we can slip through
If I could only think only go unnoticed
If we hide the anger smolder inside

Changed my face again so you'll forget me
Purified the skin it's just a covering
I've been meaning to remove my baby skin tattoo
And I meant to be more kind
And maybe next time
I'll be a friend
And next time they'll be the enemy
And you might find
What you might find

If you come my way

Bitterness will run you through
If you're in the way
Love broken by the dragon's wings
Prayed for one bright thing
Guess I'll have to wait

Frightened by my nakedness
Frightened by my own sweet smell
I know hate 

Words spit into a porous wind
Violence blows you in
If you're in the way
Mine a victim of the cold parade
Silenced some might say
Guess it came too late 

Dragged me out
Frightened by my nakedness
Fouled by my own sweet smell

Places fought for left alone
Sleep can't save me numbing 

Drags me out
In my nakedness
In my own sweet smell

Moist,"I'd walk the water to get back to you
And where I was complete
We found you scattered by the highway side too
Soon to be released
Gathered the pieces up and clean the places
Where you were undone
And washed the wreckage out unfinished all the
Thoughts that we'd begun

I came to burn the sky and tear away
The beauty that it sows
If I could rape the day and find the things I thought
I'd always known

Leave it alone again tonight

I laid your arms out long untwisted there
And shaped what I could find
Unmade the most of it and then left the rest
The parts unrecognized
My reconstruction was the only way
For one last look at you
I lost the sense of absolution
That we never knew

Leave it alone again tonight
Leave it alone again tonight

And it takes me back from this place here
It takes me back from this place here

I came to burn the sky and tear away
The beauty that it sows
I came to rape the day and find the things
I thought I'd always known

Leave it alone again tonight

And it takes me back from this place here
From this place here it takes me over
And it might be lost in this place here
From this place here it takes me on

Tonight leave it alone",Leave It Alone

Precious little pistol beaten senseless till she can't feel 

Still the moment's passing by
It's only the time that we could never stop
Early morning winter came been to close to be so close again
I never meant to be so cold
It's only the time that we could never stop
Still the moment's passing by
I'm letting Ophelia die 

Daisy dusted lightly so politely till she can't see
Itchy little trigger will deliver what you can't be 

Still the moment's passing by
It's only the time that we could never stop

Of the metal in vein

Everybody's got to die from something
Nothing ever left to leave you when you go
I saw you strip my babies
Animal the way you cut them might be
Animal the way I cut you from below

So you goad me into spite
It's the cruelty that you'd like
It's the waiting for the one thing
That you never could define
Fill the longing just because
Emasculate the ones you love
Have to wait 'til it's over

We are the less than mighty
Never was a way I thought it could be
Never quite enough to leave you when you go
I saw you strip my babies

She's trying to run but her mind just stays
I wonder where you are tonight
I wonder where you are tonight
I wonder where you are tonight
Oh tonight 

Ease into you ease into me
Fell from the places left to believe
All in the time
Time is what for
Redress the weight then bury them all
Time will save you come what may
Time will save you come what may
[a light will fall a light will fade]
Time will save you come what may
[i lie on the cross the cross I made]
Time will save you come what may
[a light will fall a light will]",Tonight
Moist,"Sitting by a Judas mantel
Underneath where I can't tell 
Found the places I'm destroying 
Only hoped you'd be there still 
Could not find a way to be it 
I don't even mind this time 
Here wed like to get things over 
Life love anything at all

And when the morning comes
Well sit here and when the atom 
Breaks well just stare
And my life goes underground 
And my life goes underground 

Sitting by a Judas mantel
Underneath well I've been there 
Could not right
The only pieces
Test out anything you will

And when the morning comes
Well sit here and when the atom 
Breaks well just stare
And my life goes underground 
And my life goes underground 

Sitting by a judas mantel
Very well what we define
Counted up the broken pieces 
Here we want to redefine
All dementia memory brought for 
All the weakness we can't tell 
Understood that I discover
Right here everything is well 

And when the morning comes
Well sit here 
And when the saddle breaks
Ill stand still
And my life goes underground 
And my life goes underground 

If I left it all the same well it 
Doesn't mean that its
Not personal
And I never understood why the 
Faces faded its so irrational 
As the atoms start to phase and 
I knew it couldn't mean that 
Much to me
And I never understood where 
The friends all go its
Not personal now",Underground

Frenzied sucking on the
Cigarette in her hand
A buxom bosom wet like
Waterfall it wasn't wasted
So come laugh come love
Come borrow everything you
Need me to be
Feel it pouring in
Liberation dies again

And we climbed so hard and
Fast so lovely
Just like it was before
Emptied out her life opened up
On the opposite shore
And I cannot believe that we
Conceived what we
Were contemplating
Its alright by me

Please help me cause I'm lost
And I can't see
Which way we go
I'm a victim just the backlash
Of your cold philosophy if you
Can't help me I will help myself
Or so this story goes

Undid the knot the lock the
Pertenity violin in her hand
Began to understand the interiors
Its operatic now
So laugh and love and borrow

Can't help me I will help myself or
So the story goes

Now I'm left with nothing
I had hoped to be
As broad as I can be

Indivisible by me
Indestructible by thee
All the places that
I had hoped to free
And all in want of nothing

Undermining
By your criminality
Its what my momma told me
Baby just come home
Rest awhile
Set you free

Come apart in pieces as she
Takes her life so hard
Took you on a holiday
Complete with promises
Of what we lost

Oh no I slipped again
I didn't mean to let you wander
Took you by the hand to show
You places that
Wed never been to
Dressed us up in autumn blues
Offered up as only you could

Every day
Is easy money
A holiday
But maybe someday
Well you and ill find our way

Burn the night and died in the
Afterglow we hoped to find
Did I forget to mention the one
Small thing
A pleasure cruise
For only you and I

Later as the ship set sail I found
The deck in easy pieces
Threw out all myself to save you
Hoping that one shred
Might get through
Oh no I slipped again

Mojo Gurus,"Well, down in Mississippi in an old tar shack
I learned to toe the line or get the hickory 'cross my back
See, my daddy liked his whiskey and he had a bad mean streak
Sweet mamma was raised Christian, born to turn the other cheek
She did her very best to teach me right from wrong
Put me on the straight and narrow, but I didn't walk it long
And I took my daddy's whupin's and I grew up hard and lean
Into the baddest mother's son Jackson County's ever seen

At seventeen I stole an Eldorado Cadillac
I drove it straight to I never once looked back
I swore no man would ever lay a hand on me again
Bought me a .45 as a means to that end
Then I painted that town redder than a Jackson fire truck
Who'd of thought one Mississippi coon ass boy would have so such luck
And I made quite the impression on the ladies and the law
I was the baddest mother's son that they ever saw
And let me tell ya, there's some pretty bad boys down in Jackson, son

One ngiht while playin' five card and winnin' me a pile
Off a big ole boy from Texas when I guess I cramped his style
He accused me of cheatin' put a hair upside my head
I drew my .45 and shot that motherfucker dead
Then all Hell broke loose but I put up quite a fight
It took half the state militia to put me in jail that night
So, Mother, when they hang me put a stone above my head
Here lies the baddest mother's son Jackson County ever bred

Baddest mother's son
Jackson County born and bred

Shit!",Baddest Mother's Son
Mojo Gurus,"Long ago in the days of carefree
I fell in love with a little girl
And I think she loved me
We shared a kiss for the very first time
Let me tell ya, people, her lips tasted just like strawberry wine

Now with my thirst awakened, I had no time to waste
See, I was ever so eager to broaden my tastes
Love was like fruit to be plucked from the vine
But don't ya know that I kept comin' back for more strawberry wine

Strawberry wine mellow and fine
Goes down smooth
And she blows my mind
Gimme strawberry wine every time
Spendin' my nights makin' strawberry wine

Looked everywhere but I never did find
A little lover so sweet as the one I left behind
Got to get back to the days of carefree
Where I had my first taste of strawberry

Traveled the high road
Been 'round the world
Only to return in search of that girl
To each his own and I to mine
To me nothing's sweeter than strawberry wine

Strawberry wine mellow and fine
Goes down smooth
And she blows my mind
Gimme strawberry wine every time
Spendin' my nights makin' strawberry wine",Strawberry Wine

And you with me? cause I'm the Navigator of this vessel
Move quickly and line up for the Expresso
It's this special, and it's got to be my way
Cause if I don't get the feeling its useless on a Friday
I wrote the fairy tales
I made the hits for the kids marine travel in between Van and Vic
Cafateria picks, you get your food and carry your shit
Find a seat in the area, sit (uhh)
Right across from the gram who cramps and if you muster up the nerve
She might give you a chance

Sip on Nescafe and its got ya poppin

Who can really bring a scene and describe the hurdles

Can they be forgiven, 
For they know not why.

And it's easy, when everything is bygone
So easy now everything is bygone
All our dreams were tied on
All that we relied on.

Came back, back to where it all began
Faced facts now that I've become a man
Seems like nothing much has changed
Though everything has died, 
Childhood reminiscence of you by my side
Picking up the stones, cause someone had to try
Will we be forgiven, for we knew not why?

People and places you've never seen
Still they lie only yards away

Down the barrel of a loaded gun, feel the fear

Here comes the summer
Here comes the summer

Shots ring out cross the twilight sky
Before night falls hear the mothers cry
In their arms just flesh and blood

Of a crime, of a crime for which we must pay
Every year, every single day, stand aside don't be afraid
Here come the boys from the Obergate, feel the fear

Tu te noies toi même, wesh, t'as chaud aux seufs
Je penses pas que Dieu a mis une graine dans le ventre de Marie
Je pense qu'elle a trompé Joseph
Tu tises, tu triches, dix dix Iblis
Et dix-huit piges, victimes on est, victime oblige
Fais pas la gaffe si tu fais le big deal
Petit, je suis dramatique et subtile
Y a que les numbos qui ne laissent pas béton
Y a que Columbo qui te baise en te respectant
On te séquestre pour ta Benz
On te rend visite à l’hôpital pour te déconseiller de porter plainte
J’emmènerai les anges au paradise tu sais
Rancunier, je cambriolerai les huissiers
T'affole pas, le juge condamne le gros caïd
Les avocats sont les riches de la cocaïne
J'rappe les bagarres, le placard, le tagga, le hagar, le hagal
Le braquage, le battage, et l'attache, le partage et la tchatche
Le saccage de la classe, le sarcasme et la trace
Les chacals et la classe, la vengeance et les casses si je jacasse, ils m'agacent
Comment je fait pour gérer mes démons imprévisibles
J'arrive en retard à mon propre enterrement

Yo, j'aime pas me lever le matin, complètement déphasé
Avec des yeuz' éclatés comme des sseu-fés de catin
J'ai envie de glandouiller, couché à la maison
Ouais je m'en bats les couilles, t'façon elles ont qu'à pendouiller
J'ai pas envie de bosser de 5 à 7
Pour un patron et plein de tapettes qui te font la leçon et te flinguent la tête
J'ai pas envie de pardonner mon beau père, il nous as laissés en chien
Sa baraque et sa meuf au bled c'était son joker
J'ai la haine contre presque toute la planète
Moi et ma bière, je suis au fond du trou de la canette
Tu ressens le blues, le mal-être, la rage dans les pupilles
La bagarre dans les yeux cousin, je rappe sale quand c'est utile
Du taga dans les futes, on s'arnaque et se fusille
En placard, ça se mutile la bac passe et elle jubile
Nos papas dans les usines fatigués de vivre
Attristés depuis qu'ils ont appris que leurs fils ont trafiqué le shit
La rue, c'est pas Joey et son ""zoum zoum zen""
Une dette, un flingue chromé et tu te fais boum boum bang!
Y a pas de boss ni de chef c'est l'anarchie totale
Tape la tise pour se canaliser, aplati nos crânes
Je crois que ça vire au drame, pas du tout d'humeur à festoyer
Salis mon blaze et je t'assure que tu te fais nettoyer
Guns, schlass dans les mains d'un soucieux
Bah ça donne un coup de feu, pas une punchline!

On s'lave encore les mains on bouffe à tout ALLAH
Ambiance cotonneux par ci bandits par là
Dédier à Kigali aux victimes de la haine...
Nomé j'y vais en jean sans cuir sans gène
T'avance les yeux vides la France elle te fatigue
direction Libreville ou Brazaville
Les horaires c'est l'horreur à Paris pas pareil

Finis donc ton assiette parlons de c'qui va bien
Regardes le temps qu'il fait s'emmerder y a pas moyens
Vraiment pas besoin d'te faire de soucis
Profiter d'la vie voilà un tour de magie

Molasses Creek,"Sometimes I stop and wonder
Why can't I let myself enjoy 
The space I'm in
And all the wonderful
Places I've been
My eyes are on the future
I can't think about the past
My aspirations
Always exceed my grasp

You've got to reach a little bit higher
When the light within becomes a fire
Hey hey woa - oh you got to grow
You've got to reach a little bit higher
To get a hold on all that you desire
Stretch your soul and you'll never grow old

When the habits of a lifetime
Become a painful cage
You want to break out
But you don't know how to change
You may have a vision
Or you may have a friend
Who will come to you
And say these same words again

Quando ela me convidou
Pra conhecer o seu apê

De bombeiro, encanador

Inocente, apaixonado
Eu tava crente crente
Que ia viver uma história de amor

Que cilada, desilusão
Ela me machucou
Ela abusou do meu coração

Drive off in your Cadillac.
He's more trouble than you think
He'll kill your sugar, leave you in the drink.

I still thought they'd gun me down

I fly the friendly skies,
I'm just a hobo,
I'm on the railroad tracks tonight,

I'm dancing through the desert,
I see the city nights,
I'm just a sailor on the sea of life.

I finally found a place where I belong,
Back out here on the road again,
Going back where I have never been,

It's all just one big gamble
Trouble is my name
I got this feelin' inside me
My looks just gotta change.

I don't look for many battles
I play by my own rules
So don't you try and stop me
'Cause I ain't no ones' fool.

Just keep right on movin'
You know I mean what I say
So all you slick backs talk fast
You'd better get outta my way.

[Chorus]
Our backs against the wall
Are we headed for a fall
No time to think at all
Down to the wall just like while it's hot
when you got it all.

Our backs against the wall
No time to think at all
Did you want to run
While you are under the gun.

It's all just one big gamble
Trouble is my name
But I just keep on movin'
God knows I'm not to blame.

[Chorus]

Our backs against the wall
No time to think at all
Did you want to run
while you are under the gun.

I never run from my battles
I play by my own rules
So don't you try and stop me
'Cause I ain't no ones' fool.

No time to think at all
Did you want to run

Oh, oh

You were alone, I took you in
I let you ride for me
Snatched you up and I made a sting
I showed you what feeling could be

Came home tonight to a barren room
And find your note of goodbye
You left nothing but a jagged heart
Like heartbreak dripping down the back of my shirt

Oh, backstabber, oh
Oh, backstabber, oh

You got my pride and slashed my mind
And carved your name so deep
You took a stab at making sure
Your memory I'd always keep

I felt you rip and tearing me
Then you made me look
Once sore I could hardly stand
My heart's still beating in the palm of your hand

Oh, backstabber, oh
Oh, backstabber, oh

Oh, yeah, you'd stop me all the way

Finding that I lose my mind.

She ought to be in handcuffs
Needs to wear a ball and chain

His clothes were old and dirty like the guns he wore low down
And as he rode the people stared, tried to look on him
He's the man who'll take your life, take your life to boothill

Sleeps by day and rides by night
Like a mongrel always lookin' for a fight
Got cold steel a bowie knife, just his way of life
He took no one, no not a sound, stares at the edge of town
Only time that he'll be found, is on the edge of sundown

Take you for your dollars babe, take you for your gold
Make your life so miserable, he's gonna leave you mean and cold
And then he'll head on out, to another town
The only time when he'll be found, is on the edge of sundown
Next time he'll be sundown.

He's a killer and a robber and he'll make you grieve
Shoot you in the back or in your sleep
Got no name or identity
Livin' in the wind, he's free---

Looking for a little company

Well I saw the dragon lady she was walking up to me
Said good God Almighty baby Lord have mercy
What a sight she was to see
She gave me a wink of her eye said boy won't you come on in
She had a face that looked like an angel but her body was built for sin

Baby, eat your heart out
Listen honey - I don't want you no more
Baby, eat your heart out
Ain't bein' funny just want you out my door

I hear the talk all over town
Says to me you're foolin' around
Come on sugar don't ya lie to me

Just beggin' for mercy if you please
Get on out on out that door

To make it right with me
But it takes a special Lady
To ride this road with me

Molly Hatchet,"I was born one rainy morning in a little house across town
Daddy liked to roam leave Mama alone
She just couldn't tie him down
He liked his gambling and whiskey
And mama just liked to cook and sew
It made me a man before my time
I felt many a cold wind blow

Worked real hard most all of my life
Bought a farmhouse out in the sticks
Set by the fire most every night
Working on my guitar licks
Before too long I was on my way
Playing from town to town
I guess I'm a little like Daddy was
Gotta keep on moving around

[Chorus:]

This journey takes me far away from home
Sometimes it makes me feel so alone
So alone

Now I look back on yesterday
Wondering what I'd done
Did I help somebody along the way
Or did I just look out for number one
I know I can't change a thing
So don't put me down
Cause I didn't cling to your heart
Oh I feel like dying when we're apart

This journey takes me far away from home
With nothing left to hold on to
But a voice from the telephone
It's taken me away from every love I've ever known
Sometimes it makes me feel so alone
So alone",The Journey
Molly Hatchet,"Where I am gonna be tomorrow
And where in the world have I been
How did it get that far when does the madness stop
Where is it taking me how did it begin
How did it begin

[Chorus]
With the look in your eyes
The look in your eyes I see you standing there
With the look in your eyes
The look in your eyes with the look in your eyes

What are all of these changes
Can't you see take a look around
Just another episode

As this old world turns
Deep inside this heart of mine a wildfire burns
And it burns

[Chorus]

At night I look to the sky
We'll reach forever you and I
Forever you and I
I look in your eyes you're all I see
I shut the world out surrounding me

If you're gonna have sunshine
Lord knows gotta stand the rain
But sometimes I get to feelin
It ain't worth all this pain

The wars been over twenty years but they still come who can
Read the names of the land of the free
Think of the brothers who went down for you and me.

I ran into an old friend I hadn't seen in 20 years
Talked about the good old days and cried some tears
You've never seen the things he's trying to forget
Saw hell for 18 months you ain't sen nothing yet

Got to quit chasin' that girl son,
Slow up your runnin', 
Things will get better son,

Throw away your sorrow

There was only you and me
And time went by so easily

We were all we ever had
Just remember, just remember, you're the only one

I had a dream one night
I made it to the limelight
Forgot where I came from
Lost sight of all my loved ones
I wasn't long until the fortune was gone
I thought it was the end
And I was hoping for a friend

Everything was gone in a blink of an eye
Without your love life ain't worth a dime, no
When you're sitting there all you've got is time
To remember, just remember, you're the only one

Now it's time that I must say to you
That you're always with me and I'll be true
It's been so long since this very day
That your love felt so strong
It could carry us away

Molly Hatchet,"Ridin' that night and the the moon is high
Gotta hell hound on my trail
Got to cross the Rio Grande
And never let me out of that jail
Feel the cool desert air, whippin' across my face
Don't make a sound stay close to the ground
Got to leave without a trace

Like my daddy before me
Said the son of the seventh son
I can't sit still when the night time comes
My spirit always on the run
I've done wrong everyone I loved
And I's livin' with that pain
The hell hounds on my trail

I watched one after another as they died
They took my heart and left me cold inside

[Chorus]
Tonight I ride, one last ride
My past is close behind me, my pistol by my side
Gotta keep on ridin'...time's not on my side
I'm a pistol totin' gamblin' man
Time for one last ride.

Just a simple country boy without a lick of sense
Colt 45 rode a thousand of fence
When you ride with the devil, baby, you heed with the devil's call
Can't sing with the angels when the hell you're bound to fall.

Town folks watched as he locked himself inside
The new this torched man was bound to die
He took the loneliness to his grave
The poor boy's soul could not be saved
The boy had finally taken his Last Ride.

And she was my baby, that's when the trouble began
And trouble follows you around all night and day

For better, for worse, I think that we both shared
We try to work it out and stay together
Then I found out, it was all spoken mirrors

If you can't stand the heat don't look in my direction
Just leave the keys and take your obsession
While the show you put on, yeah, it's quite a disgrace
Your number's on the bedroom wall, say, who wants a date?

A two time loser in love, yes, it's sink or swim
Ain't nothing gonna owe, but the rent now, baby

I could not find the sun 'cause it's raining all day and night
Hear the soundtrack to your soul coming from deep inside
Places you don't wanna go 'cause you can't hide

I'm facing the danger, but not till eternity

The world is getting bigger, all alone out in the blues
All fingers on the trigger, just tell me who made who
Raised out on the streets since I was born
Have mercy for good fortune 'cause I'm really torn

All the emotions you missed all your life
I want to show you into my heart

And I feel so alive to hold you in my arms
Did not realize the cost

That's how easy love gets lost

Flames are burning and your halo's gone tonight
Live to tell, fight to live another day
While the world's still turning, you got to get on with your life
Live to tell, fight to live another day

And then in a moment, baby, you were gone
And I had just turned my head
My whole world went upside down
'Cause I believed every word you said

Break a heart and tell a lie
Stole a kiss and never said, goodbye

Flames are burning and your halo's gone tonight
Live to tell, fight to live another day
While the world's still turning, you got to get on with your life
Live to tell, fight to live another day, live another day

Break a heart and tell a lie
Stole a kiss and never said, goodbye

Flames are burning and your halo's gone tonight
Live to tell, fight to live another day
While the world's still turning, you got to get on with your life
Live to tell, fight to live another day

To fight the war in Vietnam...
Did two tours and got shot received the metal of honor
When he got home he wasn't the same man

So when you get home tonight and give thanks to your maker
For your loved ones and the food on your table
Say a prayer for the ones who lost their lives
And the men left in the field of battle

To pass through the ages for the young and the old
They fought for the truth and the will to survive
All American by birth and born with Southern Pride

Gimme them Stars and Bars for heritage not hate

Those come what may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get a feel of life
From jazz and cocktails

The girls I knew had sad and sullen grey faces
With distant gay traces
That used to be there
You could see where they've been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clock tales

Then suddenly you came along 
With a siren song
It tempts me to madness
I thought for a while that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness...
Of a great love for me
But, I was wrong
I was wrong

Life is lonely again,
And only last week, everything seemed so sure.
Now life is awful again,
A trough full of hearts will probably be a bore, a bore

A week I might go to Paris 
At least a bite of it
All, all I want to do is laugh in spite of it

I'll forget you, I will
And yet you are still
Burning inside my brain

And it stifles those who strive
Well I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And I, I'll be alright with the rest

Molly Johnson,"It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
'n' Mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

'n' Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece-a apple pie, you know it don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now ya tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Mama said to me ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?""
""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""
""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
'n' Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge",Ode to Billie Joe

'Neath the sun's furious light

Or mere seconds from death

And when you call out
I will come to you, I will come to you

Or a moody obsession

A shriek of a devil
Or the laugh of a child
A saint's fervent prayer
Or the call of the wild

And when you call out

Fantastic elastic band

I dreamt that the bogeyman went down on Mr. Spock
Sugar was a flowing
Sock it to 'em sock
I dreamt I saw a moo cow jump across the moon
Just a flight of fantasy
Zoom zoom zoom
I dreamt I met a spaceman
He took me to his ship
You know he cut my hair off
Snip snip snip
I dreamt that I was sleeping
Asleep for heaven's sake
The dream that I was dreaming
It caused me to awake

Fe-fi-fo fun for me
Fun for me
Fe-fi-fo fun for me
Fun for me

I dreamt I was way up
I was standing on the top
With the feeling I was falling
Bop beep bop
I dreamt that I was jumping in a circus through a hoop
Someone shut the lights off
Shoo-be-doop
I dreamt that I was fast
I was never shutting up
I was going in a hurry
I was giddy-up giddy-up
I dream I'm in the park
I'm standing in the nudey
I'm getting what I wanted
Tootie fruity tootie fruity

Here in the heart of the sun my memory melts
Swellegant, elephant pain, he never forgets
Should've been a beautiful thing
Could've been a beautiful thing

Pull over to the side of the road, let the bold be bold
Luxury at a low introductory price, now wouldn't that be nice?
A happy little family puts you in a trance meanwhile back at the ranch
Insatiable hand-held flexible friend, why not give him a chance?
Could've been a beautiful thing
Should've been, could've been a beautiful thing

Promises of pleasure mesmerised, but how far can we get?
At least here in the eye of the storm I won't get my hairdo wet
Some of you have already foreseen yourself undone
Some of you seem to believe you've only just begun
Try a little perjury, get rich quick
My eyes are bigger than my belly is, and it makes me sick
Attitude, so much to prove, should've been a beautiful thing
Some of you will already know, and I'm still wondering
Should've been a beautiful thing
Could've been a beautiful thing
I could've been, should've been, could've been a beautiful thing

Moloko,"No, I won't interfere
I'm the only sound you'll ever need to hear
Listen to my breath so near
Allow me to be every noise in your ear

Every morning which is good
But my stomach's churning, call me
It would be nice if you could

Some days I question the suggestion
You might not exist at all

Would you be kind enough to call'

Your off in another story or merry-go-round
No, there'll be no measured terms
You fly in the face of the way the world turns

Like a frozen tidal wave
Since that day I'm standing still
You brought me here and I accept
Though you regret I never will

Just one sweet word
And then a smile from you
Is almost worth everything
I've given all I had to give
But you gave up giving in

You are everywhere I go
All the places we have been
I can't imagine where you are

Comiendo bocadillos que le ofrecen los empleados
Antes de viajar por cada cachete
El chofer del autobús se lo cobra como flete
Le quita el migajón a todos los bolillos
Para después guardarlo y comerlo de sus bolsillos

Porque mientras el paseaba le grito cintura bachoco
A causa de las memelas y de los ricos pambazos
Este cerdo bofarrón tiene dos potentes brazos
Al loco se lo echó con todos sus huesitos
Por la fuerza que le dan millón y medio de gansitos
Sin embargo era felíz, felíz y muy tranquilo

I can´t believe you didn´t think that
I would know better
I don´t love you you´re just a fuckin' skeezer
I pleased your beaver but now I gotta leave ya

You tried to meterse con el huidos
But we´ll know que sus orgasmos son fingidos
Pues todos sabemos que your pussy
Es mas grande que meterse en un jacuzzi

Pensaste que yo quería contigo
Buscando el anillo que se le perdió a un amigo
No sabes ni cuánto me divierte
Que me quieras tanto por checarte el aceite

And now you only want to mess with Tito
Pero él solo quiere que le chupen el pito
Y lo dejas con la pinga bien parada
Y a la hora de la hora ya no le chupastes nada
Por eso te dejo mojada
Un poco vestida y muy alborotada
Contigo yo no siento nada
Perra hija de la chingada!
Porque antes estabas delgada
Con los pechos firmes y las nalgas bien paradas
Pero ahora ya estas muy aguada
No hay quien te quiera y estas amargada
Contigo ya no siento nada

Te crees que pareces la vieja mas buena
Te vistes bonito y no hay quien te crea
Y luego te extraña que nadie te quiera
Pues todos pensamos que traes gonorrea

Por ahí ya me dijo un fulano
Que ahora te gusta también por el ano
Ya no controlas tu calentura
When you see some ass makes
You lose la cordura
Y ahora dedicas tu vida a las
Artes de masturbarte

Le quita el migajón a todos los bolillos 
Para después guardarlo y comerlo de sus bolsillos

Porque mientras el paseaba le grito cintura bachoco
A causa de las memelas y de los ricos pambazos

Al loco se lo echó con todos sus huesitos 
Por la fuerza que le dan millón y medio de gansitos 
Sin embargo era felíz, felíz y muy tranquilo

It's your life, so live it, esto es para ti so get it

When it's time for me to die
I'm the one who's gonna die
I'm the one who's gonna die
I'm the one who's gonna die
When it's time for me to die
Live my life the way I want to

For real, cuz it's your pain
When you feel it
It's your blood when you bleed it
It's your loss when you lose
Agree or disagree

That's why when you talk it
It's through your own teeth
And when you get to walk it
It's with your own feet

Remember that when it's your grief
And it's you who feels the heat
Infestation of fleas
People itching to critique
About success, they stress
And sneer at your defeats
Don't need no raised eye-brows
Or looks of disbelief
Fuck all the deceit
That they all got up in 'em
When you feel everybody
Wants to see you in the ruin
Don't pay no nevermind
Keep on doing what you're doing

I'm the one who's gonna have to die
When it's time for them to die
So if you don't like the way I live
You can kiss my ass

I'm the one who's gonna die
I'm the one who's gonna die

Live my life the way I want to

They're your boots you gonna stand in
It's your skin that you're stranded
No one else has a hand
In what fate has commanded
It's your soul that is crammed in
And your brain is rammed in
Your life, you have to plan it
No one else will do the program
So imagine, why people
Want in your soap opera, improper
How best friends will
Always try to stop ya
Sit back and relax
In your lazy-boy rocker
Make them the ones to ponder
On how they're gonna stop ya

Well it's always a shame
When it's time to pass the blame
You take it frame by frame
When it's time to play the game
And no it's never the same
When it's them thats in the rain
When it's you who gets the cane
It's you who feels the pain
Or the stain
When you are faced down in the grass
So everybody gather around
And raise your glass
Cuz no one's gonna die your death
When it's time to pass
So live like you feel
And tell em to kiss your ass

I'm the one who's gonna die
When it's time for me to die
I'm the one who's gonna die

Y quería quedarme en la casa de mi hermano
Y el me dijo, brother tu aquí no te quedas te llevo con primo
Pepe pa' la casa de mi agüela
Hay que dolor pobres vacaciones lo que hizo mi hermano
Quejarse de pantalones
Enseguida mi agüela me cayo encima pa' limarle el patillon y
Limpiarle la cocina
Yo le dije, doña! Yo vengo a descansar y ella dijo, no mijito
Usted viene a trabajar, de verdad que eres vago no se por
Que te quejas, te me afeitas esa barba y te cortas la melena
Ay! abuela la barba me la afeito pero no cortarme el pelo
Mejor me quedó muerto
Le explique que esta de moda dejarse la melena y ella dijo
Que ese chavo así parece una nena
Y como no me lo corte espero a que me durmiera
Y me dejo corto-pela´o con una je-tijera

Que vaina, que chaquenda, ¿que dirán mis panas cuando me vean? 

El otro día pal almuerzo mi dijo mi abuela
Que me iba a cocinar lo que yo quisiera
Entonces le pedí una comida bien buena, un hamburger, un hot-dog
Lo que como todos los días

No no no señor no cocino porquerías aquí se come dieta
Y arroz con habichuelas

Estaba bien buena
Ahora es me dije yo, le empecé a rapear sin que mi abuela lo supiera
Pero! ella se entero y me dio un sermón a esa niña la respetas
Yo le dije abuela tu te estas entrometiendo y me metió una
Bofetada que todavía me esta doliendo

Que vaina, no se puede ¿que dirán mis panas cuando se enteren? 

Otro día por la noche yo quería salir y ella me dijo que no
Que estas son horas de dormir
Y así me la pasé en pleno jueves todo el mundo pariciando
Y yo acostado y a las nueve

Pasaron otros días que no me fastidio por que la caja de los
Dientes se le perdió
Y aunque ella regañarme parece que quería todo lo que me
Hablaba nada se le entendía

Entonces pude descansar pero ya las vacaciones se me iban a acabar
Y como ya no encontraba que mas inventar, fingí un dolor
Que me quería matar
Haber si así me hospitalizaba y entonces yo de ahí fácil me escapaba

Pero! se me invirtió la tortilla ella me empezó a dar una medicina
Me aplico a estar en la cama acostado hasta que ella pensara
Que me había recuperado

Mi agüela, you want it? 
Huh-uh
You got it

Y así mismo un problema que al rato yo tenía, siete a la
Semanas era un no todos los días
Encontré la solución a todos mis problemas y es que tengo
Que aceptar que soy le nieto de mi abuela

Si total después de tanto protestar cuando llegue a nueva york
Yo me puse a pensar
Que ella no es lo que parece ella es bien buena y todo lo que
Hace es por ponerme en vergüenza

Pero! me recordaba yo de todos los regaños que ella a mí me dio
Y cada ves que yo hubiera querido beber ron me tenia que
Recetarme un tesito de limón

Mi madre no sabia como yo la había pasado se creía que todo
Lo había yo gozado
Se atrevió a preguntarme cuando yo volvía pa'lla

Y yo le dije mira como en treinta años mas
Yo no se si mi abuela tenga mucha resistencia
Yo no puedo soportarla por que no tengo paciencia

Mi agüela, you want it? 
Huh-uh
You got it

Mom's Home Cookin',"I still miss someone
At my door the leaves are falling 
The cold wild wind will come
Sweethearts walk by together
And I still miss someone

I go out on a party
And look for a little fun
But I find a darkened corner
'Cause I still miss someone

Oh, I never got over those blues eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there

I wonder if she's sorry
For leavin' what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere

Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

Momus,"God is a tender pervert and the angels are voyeurs
Watching us forever, their vision never blurs
They make us then forget us for a hundred million years
And then by chance they glance at us and something in them stirs
They find us so provocative, so weak, so full of pride
Our cleverness, our nakedness, fills them with delight
The way we hold our coffee cups, the way we pick our words
God is a tender pervert and his angels
His angels are voyeurs

And when the tender pervert is too busy to admire us
He sends his angels down to pass amongst us and desire us
He gives them little notebooks where they note each quirk and boast
Our foolish pride and pompousness turn him on the most
When we're throwing temper tantrums
When we're giving up the ghost
The pervert keeps his distance
But his angels, his angels move in close

It intoxicates the Spaceman, watching how we thrill ourselves
Not by sex but by devising new ways to kill ourselves
He sees the way we tamper with the things we most depend on
The danger stands his hair on end and gives him a hard-on
He calls his angels down to watch that slut the world get hers
God is a tender pervert and his angels
His angels are voyeurs

The pervert and his angels hide amongst the stars and watch
And as we blow ourselves to bits the angels pump their cocks
Their semen flows across the sky and forms new milky wheys
And somewhere in some galaxy in less than seven days
They make a planet more curvaceous and much sexier than ours
Full of bigger sinners
More worthy of voyeurs",The Angels Are Voyeurs

Momus,"I was born in the town of Paisley in early 1960
And placed in the care of an old eternal bachelor
A strict disciplinarian, a passionate antiquarian
His collection of myths and legends was spectacular

As a younger man he'd been to see Japan
Where a master in a white kimono taught him
In a shining moment the myth of the bishonen
The youthful hero doomed to fall like blossom

And how could I forgive the ugly fugitive
Who brought me up according to a fantasy?
For when the old man stared at me
He drowned in evil beauty
Thinking of the early death in store for me

He taught me to be good with words, he bought me ceremonial swords
And in this way came grace and expertise
The words were to cut down and to kill the muscle-bound
The swords to fell my intellectual enemies

And women should be hated but first impersonated
Charm, he said, is essential to misogyny
He taught me how to woo the girls in order to outdo the girls
And the fun would come when I'd got them to love me

And how could I resist the old misogynist
Who brought me up according to a fantasy?
My softness and fragility
My feminine grace and delicacy
Made death himself afraid for me

And so in time I grew to be blond and beautiful
Pale and frail, with many male admirers
I was promised by my father a retainer for a partner
So loyal that nothing could divide us

Shocked by my suggestion that I'd rather have a woman
My stepfather replied I had no choice
This man would cut his entrails open protecting his bishonen
He informed me in a solemn, trembling voice

How could I disobey that surreptitious gay
Who brought me up according to a fantasy?
For when the old man stared at me
He drowned in evil beauty
Thinking of the early death in store for me

So me and my retainer encountered many dangers
On travels through the North and through the South
We ripped open the bellies of many famous bullies
And our reputation spread by word of mouth

In the mountains of Morocco we stopped and shared a bottle
With a blind old man with a bearded, bandaged face
And though the sun had sunk and the man was very drunk
He seemed to speak with my stepfather's voice

Saying ""How could you forget the ageing martinet
Who brought you up according to a fantasy?
Your softness and fragility
Your feminine grace and delicacy
Will be the death of me""

Surprised at 28 to find myself so late
Changing from a boy into a man
I'm starting to feel guilty that nobody has killed me
Early as my stepfather had planned

I've found myself a girl and stopped roaming the world
My retainer's gone to be a mercenary
Now I work in a merchant bank, I'm well-liked by the senior ranks
Though behind my back the juniors call me fairy

And how can I placate the ugly reprobate
Who brought me up according to a fantasy?
For when the old man stared at me
He drowned in evil beauty
Thinking of the early death in store for me

I stay awake some nights when my wife turns off the lights
And starts breathing regularly next to me
And I think of fallen petals and bodies pierced by metal

Momus,"I was born with the charm of innocence
On my back like a cross
Thorns upon my forehead
Round my neck I wore it
Sometimes a rabbit's claw
Sometimes an albatross

It began at a school that turned boys into gentlemen
Then turned them on to debauchery
I was forced to my knees in front of these gentlemen
If I refused they would torture me
On Sundays I'd stalk the Botanical Garden
And under my uniform something would harden
Whenever I passed a girl of my own age

Or did it begin with au pair girls from Germany
Paid by the hour to look after us?
Did it begin with that first opportunity
To corner a stranger with nakedness?
Maybe the clinical way they undressed me
Stayed with me and deeply distressed me
I think, at heart, I'm something of a prude

I was born with the charm of innocence
On my back like a cross
Thorns upon my forehead
Round my neck I wore it
Sometimes a rabbit's claw
Sometimes an albatross

Then at eighteen I decided I wanted
To be a commercial photographer
I rented a studio down by the docks
Which I shared with a friendly pornographer
I photographed models in fluorescent light
Whose veins were so blue and whose breasts were so white
I assumed, like the moon, women were blue cheese

When I left home I already had five years
Of self abuse under my belt
I found certain women who'd let me try anything
Just to find out how it felt
In some garish hotel room with vile decoration
The wallpaper witnessed my first pollination
The paisley patterns witnessed an abortion

I was born with the charm of innocence
On my back like a cross
Thorns upon my forehead
Round my neck I wore it
Sometimes a rabbit's claw
Sometimes an albatross

In the army they taught me to share the abuse
That I'd kept up 'til then to myself
There's nothing like killing
For coaxing a shy boy of twenty-one out of his shell
In the dark continent with a peace-keeping force
I fell in with a bunch of Algerian whores
And promised them I'd try and keep in touch

We met up again in the eighteenth arrondisement
I remember them well
Their lank stringy hair and their big bulbous noses
Their unmistakable smell
I'd approach all the ugliest, seediest jerks
And ask them to keep a young model in work
Some men, thank Christ, don't discriminate at all

I was born with the charm of innocence
On my back like a cross
Thorns upon my forehead
Round my neck I wore it
Sometimes a rabbit's claw
Sometimes an albatross

I will pass my old age by a pale two-bar fire
Patiently waiting to die
Twitching the lace as the schoolgirls go past
Tracing a page of Bataille
And if you catch sight of my secondhand coat
Leaving behind it a faint whiff of goat
Remember both of us are naked underneath

I thought it would end with the first obscene phone call
The second professional kill
But somehow detached from my actual behavior
This innocence burdens me still
Up in the attic I pick up the brush
Paint in the crow's feet, paint out the blush
The face this portrait is of is still capable of
The face this portrait is supposed to be of is still capable of
The face this portrait is of is still capable of (Paint out the blush of shame)

Momus,"I was a Maoist intellectual in the music industry

I always knew that I could seize the world's imagination
And show the possibilities for transformation
I saw a nation in decay, but also a solution: Permanent cultural revolution
Whenever I played my protest songs the press applauded me
Rolled out the red carpet, parted the Red Sea
But the petit bourgeois philistines stayed away
They preferred their artists to have nothing to say

How did I pass my time on earth? Now it can be revealed:
I was a Maoist intellectual in the entertainment field

I showed the people how they lived and told them it was bad
Showed them the insanity inside the bureaucrat
And the archetypes and stereotypes that were my stock in trade
Toppled all the ivory towers that privilege had made
Though I tried to change your mind I never tried your patience
All I tried to do was to point out your exploitation
But the powers that be took this to be a personal insult
And refused to help me build my personality cult

How did I pass my time an earth, what on earth got into me?
I was a Maoist intellectual in the music industry

I left the normal world behind and started living in
A hinterland between dissolution and self discipline
I burned the midnight oil to build my way of seeing
A miner at the coal face of meaning
The rich despised the songs I wrote which told the poor their worth
Told the shy to speak and told the meek to take the earth
But my downfall came from being three things the working classes hated:
Agitated, organised and over-educated

How did I pass my time on earth, how did I bear witness?
As a Maoist intellectual in the entertainment business
And how was I treated in this world and in this industry?
As a Maoist intellectual in a business would be

I became a hotel doorman, I stood there on the doormat
Clutching my forgotten discs in their forgotten format
Trying to hand them out to all the stars who sauntered in
The ones who hadn't been like me, who hadn't lived in vain
I gave up ideology the day I lost my looks
I never found a publisher for my little red books
When I died the energy released by my frustration
Was nearly enough for re-incarnation

But if I could live my life again the last thing that I'd be
Is a Maoist intellectual in the music industry
No, if I could live my life again I think I'd like to be
The man whose job is to stop the men who think like me
Yeah! If l could live my life again that'd be the thing to be
The man who plots the stumbling blocks
In the lives of the likes of me!",I Was a Maoist Intellectual
Momus,"In the sanatorium
I've booked a private room
Where you can feel at home
Where we can be alone
Just you, the nurse and me
In mountain scenery

All the time that you've been ill
Your face has looked so pale
Drained by the force of will
Drained by the wait until
My treatment makes you well
Or weaker still

Half in love with easeful death
I cloud the mirror with your breath
Half in love with this disease
That keeps you close to me

Their most sincere desire
To travel here and share
The treatment you require

Are on the fire

Hanging round the bed
I wake you with the rustling
And you raise your head
And ask again, your voice uncertain
If you're not a burden

Because I'm not an ordinary guy

Are what the world's dying to see

Without my anxiety?

And when we came home

The tabloids said I'd died of AIDS
And you'd set up camp with the Greenham Brigades
And the serious papers we offered our story said 'Sorry'
And slammed down the phone

But in City Limits they mentioned us twice
In a feature and letter they titled respectively
'Love on ice' and 'Gay love on Ice'

One perfect couple on four perfect blades
We execute two perfect figures of eight
But the ice is a mirror in which people see
Their nation and their sexuality

Momus,"I meet this girl with a righthand heart
I notice nothing until we start to kiss
And my hand goes beneath her dress
To the lefthand breast

Downstairs the party's going full swing
The people we came with haven't noticed a thing
As I tease the teat with my teeth
I feel nothing underneath

She puts my ear across her chest
Rests my head against the righthand breast
Sure enough her heart is there
Loud and clear

The right side of oblivion
Beat, beating, beating on
The wrong side of her body

And though I know there's nothing dangerous in it
I'm feeling queasy, getting worse by the minute
Wondering how to escape this nightmare
When up the stair

Comes this boy with no heart at all
Him and her they make the perfect couple
Him so blind in his rapacity
That he doesn't even see it

The right side of oblivion
Beat, beating, beating on
The wrong side of her body

And as I contemplate this mating of rapacity and
sickness
Of which I am the fascinated, unwilling witness
I see he couldn't care where her heart might be
And I say ""what the hell is wrong with me?

Am I just too pure and too proud?""
And as the bed creaks I ask myself aloud
""Could it be that what makes me a freak Is my contempt
for freaks?""

I start to sweat, I feel it approach
Familiar self-hate, familiar self-reproach
And under my guard again it beats so hard

Reparation: five hundred five pound notes in a roll

For remarks about your weight
For complaining when you were late
Compensation: two thousand pounds, the going rate

And my eye kept roving about
Settling on younger women: Fifteen hundred, say it's forgiven

Running total: six thousand three hundred and fifty pounds

Your pantheistic new age religion
Let's say the sum of one thousand seven hundred and ninety seven

When I said your new dress wasn't splendid
When I told you the way the film ended
I guess I was wrong, accept this token: seven thousand pounds

And for passing the pictures I'd taken
Of your body totally naked
Around all our friends, let's call it a round nine thousand pounds

Dancing in the labyrinth alone

And she stands at the washbasin looking glass
Turns on the tap with a twist
And like Alice in Wonderland, quite unsurprised
Sees the razorblade enter her wrist

And the one boy that mattered rejected her

It never was so pure

So ignorant and poor

And never stayed where they belonged
And if they had we'd never have

Everything you didn't want to know about my penis

A baker has a penis thing for flattening the dough
But stick it in the oven and it rises up, like so

Has a penis with a mottled skin, I know, I asked his wife

A priest beneath his cassock has a penis just the same
Some call the hypothalamus the penis of the brain

With everything we didn't want to know about his penis

Like the heather of the Highlands, mine is tipped with flecks of purple
With a head as wise as Solomon, although shaped like a turtle
It wears a flesh-tone roll-neck and the neck goes up and down
It comes out in the evenings and on Friday paints the town
Obsessively, compulsively, it only wants one thing
To fill your chosen orifice with ropes of pearly string
Delivering its message to your womb or to your tongue
And then going slack and flaccid when its pressing work is done

In witty conversation, by drip or intravenus
I drop everything you didn't want to know about my penis

Shows promise as a songwriter (it writes most of my songs)

Jean Luc Godard once declared, to gales of mystified laughter
That some men wash their hands before they touch it, others after
And if you slot it carefully where the sun will never shine

Was stroking his penis

It's a tribute to the power of something otherwise mundane
That waving it under a stranger's nose is said to scar his brain

I keep a penis on my head but never lift my hat

It exploded like a bomb from the first world war
And seven spools of folk recordings rolled across the floor

Clouds of white gas floating in from the past
Crawl to the cashpoint, bring me the cash
And I'll get you the Sempreverde

I said 'I'm going to rape you'
She said okay
I said 'Don't say okay because then it's not rape'
She said 'Okay, I won't say okay'

Y prefiero hacerme la tonta para no verme tan sola

Lo mal que me han parido intento ocultarlo
Que sanen las heridas

Y tengo tanta pena, tanta rabia en la garganta

No te la fumes, no nunca más
No te fumes mi marihuana
No te la fumes, no nunca más

Ese día mientras me estaba bañando
Quería reflexionar, concentrarme en mí
Ese día me visitó hasta el charro
Y tú tan inconsciente, quemaste todo lo que te di

No te fumes, mi marihuana
No te la fumes, no nunca más
No te fumes mi marihuana
No te la fumes, no nunca más

Ese día mientras yo estaba rezando
Mientras pedía por los dos, por nuestro amor
Mientras comía, mientras dormía, mientras yo te amaba tanto
Te la fumaste toda, toda, toda y
Nada te importó

No te fumes, no, mi marihuana
No te la fumes, no nunca más
No te fumes mi marihuana

¿Qué voy a hacer?

Mon Laferte,"Yo me acompañaba con las sombras
Esperando, esperándote
A veces yo jugaba con las olas
Les preguntaba, ¿a dónde se fue?
Mientras me bailaban las pestañas
Se me iban subiendo las arañas
Con el dedito tapaba el sol
Mientras se me ahogaba el corazón
Como primavera en tu portal
Yo me quedé a la mitad
Hasta hoy me siento en soledad
Buscando en miles, buscando en gente
Buscando en hombres, en tantos hombres
Tu humanidad, tu paternidad

La vida aveces da, aveces quita
Se vuelve infinita como la oscuridad
A ti te dió la oportunidad de crecer margaritas
Y no de marchitar
Mientras se me cae la cortina
Yo trato de encajarte en mi vida
Ya hice mal porque ya te perdí
Sabiendo que envejeces por ahí

Como primavera en tu portal
Yo me quedé a la mitad
Hasta hoy me siento en soledad
Buscando en miles, buscando en gente
Buscando en hombres, en tantos hombres
Tu humanidad, tu paternidad

¿Te has puesto a pensar que vas a hacer cuando estés viejo? 
¿Quién te cuidará?

Mon Laferte,"¿Qué puedo decir al verte así?
No hay nada que me guste más que estar desnudos
Recién acabámos de hacer el amor
Y escuchamos mirando al techo esa canción
Que habla de si ésto será real
Que habla de si ésto es una locura
Que habla que tú ya colgaste tu armadura en mi portal

Días de amor primaveral
Humanos que son sentimental
Tiempo de mi bipolaridad, soy inestable pero sabes que te amo
Días de amor primaveral
Nadie me ha querido tan real
Eres lo mejor que me ha pasado
Y aunque sé que puedo ser insoportable

Cuando mi habitación alcanza para dos
Todo el universo calza bajo el mismo sol
Aveces todo es tan normal, tan tranquilo
No creo haberme visto antes, ahora me veo cuando te miro
Luego me preparo un té
Y me voy a tocar la guitarra
Tú te quedas dormido y te hago ésta canción para que estés tranquilo

Casi una semana atrás prometieron conocerse
Que sí, que si son ellos

Caminando y cantando uno que otro árbol del bosque
Si, son esos que van ahí
Esos que hacen locuras bajo la lluvia en la noche

Oh si
Oiga son esos dos
Que esa noche se encerraron a entregarse su amor
Esos dos se derritieron

I could never say goodbye
Like you do, like you do

We're on a war
So far from home
Keep holding on
It's always changing
And come my way
Leave unafraid
Until they say it's always changing

Mona,"You look pretty
Sitting pretty
As your world falls apart
Isn't it lovely, so lovely
A holiday for a broken heart
Just die like your past
All the pain that's inside
And dance like you don't give a damn
About your life
Love divine take what is mine
What is mine, what is mine

Even when it's fair life's not fair
You gotta live between the lines
So Mona listen
You wanna get there and you'll be there
Sometimes it takes some time
Sometimes just die like your past
All the pain that's inside
Dance like you don't give a damn
About your life
Love divine take what is mine
What is mine, what is mine

The sun rises and it sits
Tried not to forget pain
Always losing it
So walk the line
And raise a glass
Tip your hat in this past pain
You'll fly again

Love, love,
Just die like your past
All the pain that's inside
Dance like you don't give a damn
About your life
Love divine take what is mine
Just take what is mine
What is mine, what is mine
Come to me come to me
Like you're dead on the take
Come to me come to me
Like you're dead on the take

Love divine take what is mine
Just take what is mine
What is mine, what is mine
What is mine, what is mine
If I don't promise to yourself
Just don't run
You know that's true
Here we are now
Standing ground
Cause I'm standing proud with you

You wanna scream
Player stay if I touch you leave
Cover to suspect
I always push the shit
Here we go now
It's you and me
Dance with the flow
Don't lose your grip
Now watch your steps
So you just don't slip
Everything in the earth will shake
What is mine, mine, mine
What is mine, mine, what is mine

You know you'll find me

A song in blue
Like a flower crying

From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes

Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside

What's going on in your mind
Is it affection ya need
Is it love you wanna find
I can take you where you wanna go

And take you places that you wanna be

I’ll never find the words, my Lord
To tell You how I feel, my Lord
Mere words could not explain

Precious Lord
You hold my life within your hands
Created everything on earth
Taught me how to live again

Only You
You cared when I needed a friend
Believed in me through thick and thin
This song is for You
Filled with gratitude and love

I'll praise You
You make me feel brand new
I'll sing this praise to You
You make me feel brand new
I sing this song ’cause You
You make me feel brand new

My Lord
Whenever I was insecure
You built me up and made me sure
You gave my life back to me

Precious Lord
In You I’ll always have a friend
You’re someone who I can depend
To walk a road that sometimes the end

Without You
My life has no meaning or rhyme
Like notes to a song out of time
How can I repay
You for having faith in me

I'll praise You
You make me feel brand new
I'll sing this praise to You
You make me feel brand new
Our praise is due to You
You make me feel brand new

I raise my hands to You
You make me feel brand new
I sing this song ’cause You

I have so much to say
But words don't flow as good as they should.

Each day I live
Is such a game to play
I'll take my time and give it a chance today

I don't know why, I seem to fall to these things.
But love can't live then just disappear

I'll try to speak
There is so much to say.
But words don't flow as good as they should.",Billy Bones
Monaco,"When I feel so insecure
And it all seems so unsure
And my mind is miles away

When I'm down and can't get up
And I've just run out of luck
And there's nothing else to say

And all the while
You keep me holding on
Though I feel like my life is nearly gone

And when life seems so absurd
And everyone has heard
'bout something you should die for
So scary though it seems
That you live your life in dreams
And there's nothing left to cry for

Though I look at you
And know that you're the one

I've seen cry I realize
That everything will just work out fine

So let love always shine on
Turn the light on till everyone goes blind
And we'll stay together
Make it better all the time

Did you say that love has its price
Paying with the time's of your life
It's not a crime so realize
That everything will work out alright
Strip away your hopes and your fears
Drowning in the trails of my tears
Stop the lies and dry your eyes
And everything will work out alright

So let love always shine on
Turn the light on till everyone goes blind
And we'll stay together
Make it better all the time

Just for a day
I'll slip away

And it's all such a mess

Face. Like the sun it disappears each day.

And you do something beautiful. Touches
Me inside. Takes me up to paradise. And
There's no place. I can hide. You did
Something beautiful and I love you till I die.

Brighter than the sun. Higher than the
Clouds. My imagination's running wild
Could this be an exploration. Or my
Change of view. Does a love grow stronger everyday

Me inside. Takes me up to paradise. And
There's no place I can hide. You did
Something beautiful and I'll love you till you die.

Supposed to do.

So don't live a life of emptiness
It's too late to stop now it's begun

To me. And everyday I think about the way it
Used to be)

That got my life together. But it left me feeling
Cold. Made of silver not of gold. Here I am without
A clue. Why a love could never last forever
Cross the ocean and the sea. A better plate for
You and me

Take me to our Promised Land.
Where I'll find someone new.
But I can't even stand myself without you.
But there is nothing I can do.
I'm a fool for hurting you.
And the only thing I care about.
Never will come true.


'cause I've got a feeling
I can believe in.
I'll never change.
So turn around and walk away.
Yeah I've got a feeling.
I can believe in.
I'll never change.
So turn around and walk away.


Can I justify myself.
Having you around.
Keeping both my feet on solid ground.
I've been waiting for so long.
Can anybody tell.
You always thought you new me very well.
But there is nothing I can do.
I'm a fool for hurting you.
And the only thing I care about.
Never will come true.

Thank you kindly for thinking of me. Joy or
Sorrow what will it be. Now that it's over where
Will it end. Nothing else matters I'll try it again.
So you can go if you want to. I won't stop you
This time. But if you stay then I'll love you. Be forever
By your side.

I'm in no hurry the pleasure's all mine
You said you're sorry too many times
Don't mess with my world don't tear it apart
I saw it coming right from the start
So you can go if you want to. I won't stop you
This time. But if you stay then I'll love you
Be forever by your side

So you can go if you want to. Let your
Conscience be your guide. But if you stay then
I'll love you. I've got nothing left to hide.
So please don't go. All the loving you gave me has
Torn me apart. You gotta stop trying to change
Me it's going too far

So you can go if you want to. I won't stop you
This time. But if you stay then I'll love you
Be forever by your side

So you can go if you want to. Let your
Conscience be your guide. But if you stay then
I'll love you. I've got nothing left to hide.







",It's a Boy
Monaco,"I saw it in her face. When she felt a trace on
A coffee cup. I never realized but I know I should.
Heard it in a song and I read it in a book.
Gonna take a chance or a second look. It doesn't
Really matter but its plain to see. Then it all
Came back to me

I can see it in your eyes. Keeping me alive.
Looks as if I'm here to stay. You're waiting for
The day. When I go away. Looks as if I'm here
To stay. I can see it in your eyes. Keeping me
Alive. Looks as if I'm here to stay. You're
Waiting for the day. When I go away. Looks
As if I'm here to stay

Staring into space. Running out of time
Running out of luck. I wanna tell the world that
I'm giving up. Standing on my own steady as
A rock. Gonna take my time till I reach the top.
I never realized but its plain to see. Then it
All came back to me.

I can see it in your eyes. Keeping me alive.
Looks as if I'm here to stay. You're waiting for
The day. When I go away. Looks as if I'm here
To stay. I can see it in your eyes. Keeping me
Alive. Looks as if I'm here to stay. You're waiting
For the day. When I go away. I can't believe a
Word you're saying.

I could love you any old time. I'll take a
Chance on making you mine. Do you know what
You're putting me through? What can I do 'cause
It all comes back to you.

I can see it your eyes. keeping me alive.
Looks as if I'm here to stay. You're waiting for
The day. When I go away. Looks as if I'm here
To stay. I can see it in your eyes. Keeping me
Alive. Looks as if I'm here to stay. You're waiting
For the day. When I go away. Looks as if I'm here to stay.








",Kashmere
Monaco,"Lose myself in broken dreams.
Twisting round and round inside my mind.
They take me to a better place.
Where I can watch the world go slowly by.
And I wonder why the tears in my eyes.
Come tumbling down, down, down.
They fall to the earth for what its worth.
Without a sound, sound, sound.
Falls without a sound.


Walking down a busy street.
I'm staring at the people passing by.
I don't care what they think of me.
'cause they don't ever look me in the eyes.
And I wonder why the tears in my eyes.
Come tumbling down, down, down.
They fall to the earth for what its worth.
Without a sound, sound, sound.
Falls without a sound.


Suddenly you're not alone.
You're coming home, coming home.
Suddenly you're not alone.
You're coming home, coming home.
Suddenly you're not alone.
You're coming home, coming home.
Suddenly you're not alone.
You're coming home, coming home.

MonaLisa,"It's late in the evening; she's wondering what clothes to wear
She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair
And then she asks me, Do I look all right?
And I say, ""Yes, you look wonderful tonight

We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady that's walking around with me
And then she asks me, Do you feel all right?
And I say, ""Yes, I feel wonderful tonight""

I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you

It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed
And then I tell her, as I turn out the light
I say, ""My darling, you were wonderful tonight

To wait for his return and their embrace

Off to war to fight for righteousness
He must leave there’s faith put on his strength
At their goodbye, the ice begins to break, no

She waits for him while the seasons turn
The flame in her heart it will always burn

She waits for signs but they never come
Standing her ground for a millennium
Keep falling in love falling in love with a memory

And she’s still standing

Many years go by but still she stands
On this spot in bitter broken land
Nothing can be done to set her free, shadow

Now she sinks in to the depths below
Life it fades and ice surrounds her soul
He returns now that the battle's won

She waits for him while the seasons turn
The flame in her heart it will always burn

With distant gay traces
That used to be there you could see where theyd been washed away
By too many through the day...

To tempt me to madness!
I thought for a while that your poignant smile was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me.

Ah yes! I was wrong...
Again,
I was wrong.

Life is lonely again,
And only last year everything seemed so sure.
Now life is awful again,
A troughful of hearts could only be a bore.
A week in paris will ease the bite of it,
All I care is to smile in spite of it.

Ill forget you, I will
While yet you are still burning inside my brain.
Romance is mush,
Stifling those who strive.
Ill live a lush life in some small dive...
And there Ill be, while I rot
With the rest of those whose lives are lonely, too..

Monchy & Alexandra,"Deslizarme de a poquito por el ruedo de tu falda
Es el sueño que quisiera realizar y no me dejas
Regálame una mañana yo te sirvo de almohada

Postúlame a tu cama y habrá fiesta tienes
Lo que  necesito padeciendo estoy de ganas
Quiero comerte como la fiera a su presa
Sin dejarnos en la piel una pulgada y saborearnos
Como dulce preferido hasta perder el sentido

Moviendo de a poquito mi vida tu interior robarte
Los gemidos con el corazón
Ay, entiérrame en tu vientre haz que en mi llueva
Hoy tómame de un tomito um, si quieres mi flor
Ay, Moviendo de a poquito mi vida tu interior
Robarte los gemidos con el corazón

Tienes lo que necesito padeciendo estoy de ganas
Quiero comerte como la fiera a su presa
Sin dejarnos en la piel una pulgada y saborearnos
Como dulce preferido hasta perder el sentido

Moviendo de a poquito mi vida tu interior robarte
Los gemidos con el corazón
Ay, entiérrame en tu vientre haz que en mi llueva
Hoy tómame de un tomito um, si quieres mi flor
Ay, Moviendo de a poquito mi vida tu interior
Robarte los gemidos con el corazón

Fantasías tengo vida por tu amor y comerte a besos
Sin descanso hoy fantasías quiero en ti realizar
Sobre tus murallas fiesta sin parar

Moviendo de a poquito mi vida tu interior robarte
Los gemidos con el  corazón
Ay, entiérrame en tu vientre haz que mi llueva
Hoy, tómame de un tomito si quieres mi flor

Que mata, esa aroma que envuelve
Y que me embriaga hasta el alma
Tu manera de hablarme al oido
Me hace vivir

Tu pelo negro que vuela y me acaricia
La cara ese beso que me enciende al
Llegar la madrugada tu manera de hacerme
El amor al cielo me hace subir ,es que yo
Quiero llevarte conmigo a un mundo nuevo
Muy lejos de aqui

Llevame a donde tu quieras amor
Que junto a ti yo soy feliz, contigo
Soy feliz
(Contigo soy feliz)

Los dos estamos perdidos en un barco
Sin destino navegando en lo prohibido
Atrapados en los mares de pasion, perdidos
Entregados sin medidas en silencio y a
Escondidas esperando a que amanezca en
Nuestra tierra prometida

Hay que encontrar el camino a nuestra
Felicidad en donde nadie nos diga a quien
Tenemos que amar

Venderemos amores, corazones
Y hechemos a volar

Es que yo quiero llevarte conmigo
A un mundo nuevo muy lejos de aqui

Llevame a donde tu quieras amor
Que junto a ti yo soy feliz, contigo
Soy feliz

Prohibido atrapados en los mares de
Pasion ,perdidos entregados sin medidas
En silencio y a escondidas esperando a
Que amanezca en nuestra tierra prometida

Monday Michiru,"Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of

Something special happened I never knew before
Was it in your eyes, feelings you can't disguise
Something's telling me that

With a dozen roses
Make sure that she knows it
With a flower from your heart 

Show him your love
Don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason

I've heard so many say that the days of romance are no more
And people falling in love is so old fashioned
But waiting are they the day they once let slip away
Hiding need to fulfill their heart's desire for love's passion

Make sure that she knows it
With a flower from your heart

Don't hold back your feelings

And can only happen in make believe stories
But so blind they all must be that they cannot believe what they see

Monday Morning,"Can you recall the days of ennocence long lift behind
They're like a dream that you can't retrace your steps to find
It's holding you by sll the things you've hidden so far down inside
You just can't see a way to escape this life, you're so blind

It's killing me
To see you there
Wasting away
You can't give up what brings you down
I can't describe how it felt to see the world through your eyes
But I can describe how this love makes me so alive

Monday Morning,"CHORUS
I can't change by myself no I can't live without You(2x)
Day by day, I'm a slave to my ambition to be free
Feel so dead in this web I've spun around me
The seeds of hate I've sown they grow to entangle me
Why can't I see that true freedom comes from You
Everywhere I see Your face en creation
But the love You've shown was not for me alone
My color of skin cannot determine what my heart reveals
Why can't I see that true beauty comes from You
So free my mind
'Cause I want to live




",Can't Go On
Monday Morning,"Is there truth becoming
Away from me
I fear the flames consuming
Could it be I abandoned your side?
When all required was a Word
Dear you, dear you

How could I leave
How could I try
To hide from you what burns inside
The change I've lived
The Love that cried
The part of me that died that night

Well you could be
The undoing of me
I can sleep
Awake at the thought
Of you knowing

Something showing
Truth amidst the lies
Disguise and compromise
And I scream?
Dear you, dear you

How could I leave
How could I try
To hide from you what burns inside
The change I've lived
The Love that cried
The part of me that died that night

Could you see
How much that you mean to me
I'm sorry
I let you slip away
From all that you could be
Why didn't I say
Dear you, dear you

How could I leave
How could I try
To hide from you what burns inside
The change I've lived
The Love that cried
The part of me that died that night

Monday Morning,"You see the shadows standing by your door
And as it inches open you say
I can't take it anymore
It's all too often
They take it out of you
Why can't the love the way you love
Why can't your dreams come true

And I see the pain running from your eyes
It tells me that you're desperate to find a love that can
Melt your cold heart inside
Heal your hurt and ease your mind

Look in the mirror
At your battered face again
It brings a tear to your eyes as you turn and see
Headlights in the driveway
He's coming home again
Why can't he love the way you love
So hard to understand

You've traveled far from the place you once called home
Now this time you feel so alone
This love will find you, the one you're searching for
And if you can love with this love
You'd be so much more, so much more",Desperate
Monday Morning,"All my hopes and dreams inside 
Visions lurk behind my eyes
Something new behind it grows
And You smile as my heart knows
To be another still with You
I'm the one that loved You through
But I'm still nothing next to You
I'm still nothing next to You
What I've seen and where I've been
What's breaking out and breaking in
Who I love and I despise
Melting into compromise
How I've changed and how I've learned
Becoming less becoming more
And I'm still nothing next to You
I'm still nothing without You

The sickness my mind's battled long
The center of my every song
The beauty of my voice it fades
Into a spiritual cascade
Flowing form Your perfect smile
I've avoided all the while
But I'm still nothing next to You
I'm still nothing next to You
All the future seems unclear
Never moving never near
But You hold me as I scream
Wake me from my wicked dream
Something out there waits for me
Hand in hand we wait for it
But I'm still nothing next to You
I'm still nothing without You

[Chorus]
And the wonder of it all is I'm still standing
And the wonder of it all is we're still standing
Never planned it
And I wonder where I'll be next year

Will You stand right next to me
Will You hold me faithfully
Should I question all these things
What makes me so deserving
Of something that I've thrown away
Coming back for me today
When I'm still nothing next to You
I'm still nothing next to You
Hearts are broken just to mend
When will my brokenness end
Lending my mind to dreams it seems
Some things are never meant to be
But faith it lingers as I die
Inside surrendering I cry
I'm still nothing next to You
I'm still nothing without You

[Chorus]

Time is a broken dream
Time is an endless change
Time is an offering
Time has the endless sting
Time has a world to bring
Time, it's a broken dream
Mended while lovers sing

Monday Morning,"The restless wander never staying
To weather through it all, they're lost to question
Their soul direction, the stones they run to fall

Never looking over a fading shoulder
To see just what's become, the time's [unverified]
Joy lost escaping if only we would

Stand when the lines are breaking
Stand when my heart is aching
Stand where you want me, I'll be here

Stand when the storms could rumble
Stand until the walls crumble
Stand where you want me, I'll be here

We fight a never-ending battle
I fear a cataclysmic ending to it all
But faith it holds me, your word would mold me
And tell me just to

Here though the Earth is moving
Here fighting win or losing
And I'll be here, I'll be here

Will I cry, will I fold
Underneath all the fears
That my mind has foretold
And the light is so near
But I cannot be seen

Do I run
Do I fall in between

the clouds are breaking with another day
My darkness breaks beneath the dawn
Can you feel the sunshine

feel my heart when it breaks
See my hands as they shake
Feel the dark of the night in the midst of the day
What's the deal
What's the cure
There's an aswer I'm sure
Do I change
Do I fight
Do I run for the door

And everything I've known
Watch it go, let it go... no

Il mio rap è il progresso
Il tuo rap è una truffa
Pensi di conoscere il gioco, frà sono Fede Buffa
Se avessi qua quella giusta
Potrei anche sposarla
Ma vedo solo troie e mi danno più testa che Harvard
Ti uccidiamo e poi ogni mio frà calpesta la salma
Qua si detesta la calma
Dici che fumi, frate questa è una canna
Marcio fa i numeri in FIMI
Top ten, solitudine dei numeri primi
I tuoi pezzi li sai solo tu che li scrivi
I miei sono classici ormai piovo oro, Klondike

Mondo Marcio,"Ricordati che non tutte le parole finiscono nel vento
E alcune rose crescono davveero dal cemento
Marcio

A volte mi chiedo come faccio
A un marcio serve un cuore di ghiaccio 
Ho il futuro sulle spalle e tutto il mondo sul cazzo 
Dicono l'amore muove il pianeta, già
La vita non è un gioco ma ti serve la moneta

Cresciuti in quartiere, fratelli acquisiti 
Correndo in giro come cani impazziti 
I figli della city, zero città degli angeli 
Qua solo marci, a fare business a tutti gli angoli

Mi segui, la strada è l'ufficio, i miei colleghi 
Non hanno colletti bianchi ma alzano i contanti 
Non hanno spettrogrammi hanno cento grammi 
Vestono kilo perché non stendono solo i panni

Se c'è una cosa che ho imparato la vita è una ruota 
Un solo credo frà non rimarremo a pancia vuota 
Questi rapper da clichet non lo sanno 
Qua ogni weekend è capodanno

Ho messo da parte il sogno di un mondo migliore 
Faccio quello che devo, tu fattene una ragione
Ma frà se avessi una moneta ci farei un impero, per darlo al 
Figlio che non ho ancora avuto, e dirgli è tutto vero 

Se avessi acqua la darei al deserto 
Frà la mia erba cresce dal cemento e la risposta è nel vento 
Quando muoio ascolta questo fino al mio ritorno 
Alza la testa, domani è un altro giorno

Rappo per ogni madre sola che ha cresciuto un figlio 
L'unico maggiordomo che abbia mai avuto è E.M.I.L.I.O. 
Cresciuti a pane e inventiva, sputo sangue e saliva 
La vita è una maga ogni tanto qualcuno spariva

Addosso i pantaloni larghi per la refurtiva 
Tratto l'auto blu come fosse radiottiva 
Ogni sera nel club, tra le birre e le risse 
Terrorizzato dalle sirene, l'opposto di Ulisse

Cerco risposte come Dylan, soffio nel vento 
Cacciatore in una giungla di cemento 
Zero foresta di bambù ma mille canne i figli 
Chiudono affari, per pagare Sky alle mamme

Questa è per chi non si è arreso
Sulla  strada per il paradiso guarda quante multe ho preso 
E se non ci aprono le porte del cielo
Ho un amico che mi fa entrare dal retro, mi spiego? 

Ho messo da parte il sogno di un mondo migliore 
Faccio quello che devo, tu fattene una ragione
Ma fra', se avessi una moneta ci farei un impero 
Per darlo al figlio che non ho ancora avuto, e dirgli è tutto vero

Se avessi acqua la darei al deserto 
Frà, la mia erba cresce dal cemento e la risposta è nel vento 
Quando muoio ascolta questo fino al mio ritorno 
Alza la testa, domani è un altro giorno

Esatto è un altro giorno tengo duro tipo cialis 
Dio ha la segreteria, riproverò domani 
A volte sembra che, mi capiscono solo i marziani 
Non so volare ma frà quanto costa un paio di ali 

Perché mamma non sa più a chi accendere i suoi ceri 
E onestamente Pa', un po' mi spiace che non c'eri 
Non hai visto un ragazzino diventare un uomo 
Quindici anni fa mi hai salutato e guarda dove sono

Ma non si torna nel passato, zero macchina del tempo 
Salto in macchina frà non ho tempo 
Ho questi soldi da fare, un destino da cambiare 
Non conta come, io vendo l'acqua al mare

Ho messo da parte il sogno di un mondo migliore 
Faccio quello che devo, tu fattene una ragione 
Ma frà se avessi una moneta ci farei un impero
Per darlo al figlio che non ho ancora avuto, e dirgli è tutto vero

Se avessi acqua la darei al deserto 
Frà la mia erba cresce dal cemento e la risposta è nel vento

Governiamo a quattro mani, siamo un sire e un re
Non è un paese per giovani lo stivale
Come dargli torto, dopo che vi hanno sentito cantare
Ridammi il mic, non cambi mai, non ce la fai
Branco di fighette minorenni (Non è la Rai)
Per svoltare ci vuole più tradizione
Non basta una super canzone alla televisione
Sei nato nell’anno del super cafone

Tu lo leggi sul post, fai selfie su shots
Io lo vivo dal vivo frà tu ascolti i blog
Questo gioco del rap, punto tutto sul black
Più che nuove leve sembra il ritorno dei Take That
Frà questo è più che rap
Su le mani, rapina
Questo inchiostro mi scorre nel sangue, emoglockina
Questi rapper puttane, frate lasciali battere
MC da carnevale, vedo solo le chiacchiere
E se dovessi ardere tra le fiamme dell’inferno hey
Metti su questo e vivrò in eterno

When you say it’s on fire
When you said it’s on fire
When you said it’s on fire, oh
When you said it’s on fire
You said it’s on fire
But the flames just keep on getting higher

Baby mi metti a fuoco, perdo la ragione
Faccio lo stesso con te, come l’inquisizione
Mai cercato la fama, la fama mi ha trovato
In mezzo a una strada che rappavo tutto fumato
Faccio questo da sempre, ho la vittoria in mente
Ho detto al diavolo hey, parla col mio agente
Conosco brutta gente, ma sono i miei frà
Alcuni sono lassù, bro ci vediamo là
Fino all’ultimo giorno, fino alla fine del mondo
Finché gli angeli del paradiso non vanno contro
Alle armate delle tenebre man, io sono pronto
Ho ordinato il Santo Graal, pagherò il conto
Dall’alba al tramonto, da Niguarda a Compton
Da Milano alla Luna baby, non c’è ritorno
E se dovessi andare tra le fiamme dell’inferno hey
Metti su questo, vivrò in eterno

When you said it’s on fire

Più puttane che a Bangkok
Fumo un etto, fumetto, Capitan Harlock

Non so dove sei adesso
Mi guardavo allo specchio e non ero io nel riflesso
Dicevi non cambiare
Come potevo?
Tu iniziavi ogni frase dicendo stavolta sarà diverso
È il sapore del sesso
Poi un sapore più spesso
Quella sensazione tipo ti voglio qua e adesso
E ti ho tagliata dentro
Ora conti le ore
Dici ti ho fatto male?
No, ti ho fatto un favore
Ti ho strappato le ali
E senza ali non voli
Ci siamo rotti in due
Ci aggiustiamo da soli
E ora vorresti darmele, bambola, Annabelle
Non sono un granchè a dire addio ma sono il numero uno a andarmene
Non voglio queste cagne, assetate di scarpe
Borse e cene
Tu e io come Venere e Marte

Fumando cioccolata
Scusa se rido ma mi amavi di più da ubriaca
Mi immagini con Sara
O Giulia se impara
Mi hai dato tutto e io ti ho fatto colare il mascara
Impara la lezione
Al mondo non c’è amore
Solo interesse e noi avevamo un’ottima ragione
Per perdere la direzione, eri strana
Chi è quella puttana? era diventato il mio secondo nome
Litigate per ore
Dovevo starci attento
La quarta dimensione
Nel nostro spazio-tempo
A occhi chiusi mi vedi
Dicono impara a amare ciò che hai o la vita ti insegna a amare ciò che avevi

Mi hai visto splendere
Mi hai visto sanguinare

Non c’è giustizia come chi caccia l’avorio
Anche un angelo darebbe le ali per il tuo purgatorio
E io ti ho trascinata insieme a me all’inferno
E uscirne è come dire a un tossico di stare fermo
È come vivere al mare ma è sempre inverno
Un esperimento di un dio maldestro ci ha fatto questo e ora è fuoco eterno
Vorrei riavvolgere il tempo perso, riaverti adesso

Sono nato in cattività, così malato serve una visita
Grandi Dil, musica minima, la mia vita è un film, Cinecittà
Ora brillo come un neon prima era tutto nero
La mia vita è come il National Geo, frate, è tutto vero
Ho fatto ritornare i soldi a riva come la marea
E mi sono ricostruito da solo, già, mister Ikea
Mai avuto i soldi di famiglia, è stata dura
Ma per avere quelli, fra devi averne una (ah)
Mi volevano sparito, sono qua più forte di prima

Ogni euro guadagnato, è uno schiaffo in faccia al destino
E per ogni euro che mi hai rubato, sarai marchiato Caino 
Ero un bambino, solo un bambino, e già mi oscuravano il sole
Il disco con Mina ti ha confermato che le loro sono solo parole
Non sono qua a fare promozione, sono qua a raccontare una storia
Magari non vado su Vanity Fair, ma per chi c’è passato è qualcosa
Meglio che fare la guerra di click o di cercare la provocazione
E i talent sono uno show baby non sono la soluzione
Quanti Moreno devono ancora morire per farti vedere la luce
Le ho viste tutte a palpebre chiuse, niente scuse (losers)

Chiunque pagherebbe per andare in TV, quasi come se la tele fosse un punto d’arrivo
Ma nessuno pagherebbe per spaccare di più, fra il mio Rap è fumo denso, il tuo è fumo passivo
Non è un singolo di merda a farvi essere un re, sono qua per restare
Questa scena è il mio trono, tu fai musica da frocio come il gruppo dei Tokyo

Fra', mi sento solo anche in mezzo alla gente
Voglio prendere il volo ma non serve a niente
Qua mi tengono al suolo per usarmi da salvagente
Non lo sapevi, qua non si salva niente
Il mio diavolo guida la strada e non ha la patente
Ho la prigione in testa
Se cercavi una storia dove tutto era okay, beh non è questa

Non devo essere in un carcere per stare in gabbia
Sto costruendo i miei castelli con sogni di sabbia
Fra', quest'Italia lo so che non cambia
Vedo bambini prodigio diventare uomini standard
Sono nato solo e me ne andrò uguale
Mi hanno buttato in questo mondo senza un manuale
Mi renderà più forte, se prima non mi ammazza
Ho raccolto i piatti rotti e ci ho fatto una corazza

Questo cuore ha pianto finché è diventato asciutto
Queste nocche sanguinano, hanno dato tutto
Queste gambe hanno corso fino alla luna
Per mostrare a questi occhi solo quanto è dura
E questo mondo gira solo per inerzia
Ma se stanotte resti qui forse sarà diversa
Queste stelle dicono: guarda ma non toccare
Questo cielo non ci parla ma ci fa gridare

Questa casa è così fredda ora che non ci sei
Se ce li avessi avuti ti avrei presentato i miei
Ma poco male dicono, non ti guardare indietro
Rispetto a me è più empatico Terminator
Così non ci sono nato mi hanno fatto
Stanco di girare per la strada fatto
Dicono che tutto torna è una ruota
Ma la foto che avevo con te adesso è una cornice vuota
Come puoi criticarmi per come sono
Ci ho fatto un disco tutti contro ero solo un uomo
Sono il frutto di un ambiente gelido
È normale che mi trovi freddo e ancora sta scendendo
La temperatura, più salgo in alto
Fra', quando arrivi in cima non ci trovi nessun'altro
Ma preferivo una capanna a un castello
Almeno in quella capanna non era sempre inverno

Questo cuore ha pianto finché è diventato asciutto
Queste nocche sanguinano, hanno dato tutto
Queste gambe hanno corso fino alla luna

Questo cielo non ci parla ma ci fa gridare

Questo mondo non perdona e il cielo non ci guarda
Figli illegittimi, la vita è puttana e bastarda
Ho visto i veri, ho visto i falsi
Avessi un euro per ogni rimpianto sarei Arist' Onassis
Ho lasciato tutte le classi
Preso così tanti voli che ormai non ho più bagagli
Mi vuoi mordere per la rabbia, ci sentiamo unici
Ma siamo polvere nella sabbia
Ordine in questa gabbia

Non vedo come ma potrei sentire la mia voce per sempre dentro a una canzone
Sta diventando freddo anche questo sole
E vive solo il tuo ricordo, il resto muore
Questo cuore

Here's another one

Uh, yeah
I remember being on that nigga's chair, hard
Back in the day in the projects
Chasing after him, a lil' young chick
Seeing him made me go back in my lab
And write this lil' shit like this
Check it out

Here's how it goes
Used to see you when I went to the store
Always watch you play ball from my bedroom window
The places you frequent, the chicks you freaked with
The spot in the grass where you kept your stash

I used to wonder to myself if you felt my eyes
If you ever noticed me and knew I was alive
I tried to draw your attention, wore dresses to my thighs
With hopes to get close to you

Used to dream about you right before I went to sleep
Used to wake up on the morning hugging the sheets
Used to practice what I'd say for the day that we meet
Used to pray every day for the day that we meet

Used to hang with your sis if she only knew
I only hung with that bitch to get closer to you
Wasn't no limit to the things I would do
To give all my love to you, my God

Can't feel myself
Don't want nobody else to ever love you 
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night
I don't love you

I just don't want to stop
Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much
(Yeah, uh huh, yeah, Queen Pen take it to the Brooklyn Bridge)

Stop being by yourself, now you hung with the crew
I took the bangs out my hair over the summer, I grew
Me and my friends, all virgins, all learning, 
How to tow that shit, how to throw that shit

Talked about that sex like I was used to it
Lying about how many you used to kiss
In the hallways, all day, 'till it was real
In the staircase, lights out, giving out feels

Put your name in my notebook, we all did that
Lined our names up with numbers to see if they matched
Scared to death 'bout the first time, I knew it would hurt
In your house, on your mother's couch, she was at work

Dead wrong, but head strong, ya had in this broad
The only one I ever loved ever since I was young
Once in a while I even cut school to give all my love to you 
My God

Can't feel myself
Don't want nobody else to ever love you 
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night
I don't love you 
You're at the top of my list

And the wine is yet to be
I don’t care about nothing
When it’s you and me

Then I hear you say
Tomorrow will be like today

Threw a wire out
Through the love of a sudden kind
Never used to have to question all of the little starts
That go on in my mind

And the world is spinning,
Round and round
I heard it used to be a new idea
I don’t care about nothing
When you’re here

And I hear you say
Tomorrow will be like today",Tomorrow Will Be Like Today

You say you have to touch the sun and then you'll return to me

Some things never start, ours is turning into memories
And guess there's no way to avoid a broken heart
What I can say is, I will never go very far

We'll be brand new by tomorrow

I used to love the games we played
But now I have to stay on my side of the street
I like the words we used to say to each other
But now our vocabulary's changed

Anytime you want me to pretend, I will
You'll always be my friend looking out the window sill

Money Mark,"Since you've been gone, I've lost my cleverness
And since you've walked away, I just can't deal with this
Loneliness and emptiness
I can't fake it, I feel naked

Wherever I go, people can see, it's in my face
And when I breathe, it's the story of faded glory
Life is made up of all that you lose
Can't even choose the color of your blues

Since you've been gone, I have no eagerness
I live in yesterday's old dusty promises
I believed in what you said
I can't fake it, I feel naked

I do the math and nothing adds up

When you take a step, you're so intact
No one can bring you down
I know I would never bring you down

And there's nothing that I got to prove

Money Mark,"It's always complicated whenever you're around
Simultaneously loving you, I wear the thorny crown
Hiding in all the corners, live in a room that's bright
Maybe there is a reason that you never make a sound

Silence is the loudest thing
When you look at me with eyes that ring

I want to look into the sun, I want to feel you beaming up
You make me feel so high, you make me feel so high
I want to feel so high
Never come down

It's always complicated whenever you're around
Walking on all those winding roads, it's me you're walking on
Hiding in all the corners, live in a room that's bright

And he became a familiar sound
Got so tired of the melody
Melodies were meant to be free

You got me pickin' up all my pieces
Put 'em back in my pocket in case I need them
Hoping it's not, if but when
Hoping it's not so much later but so soon, ooh

When we last talked, we didn't expect a thing
Couldn't believe but your love did sting
If I found myself walking backwards into you
Would you spill out all your memories too?

We're pickin' up all our pieces
Put 'em back in our pockets and just leave them
Hoping it's not, if but when
Hoping the same old melody will feel new, ooh

'cause you radiate nothing

You walk around with your dirty old crown
Your pride, you never swallow it
You think you own this town
Well, maybe you did but I just didn't follow it

It's written all over your face
This is not your place and you just won't admit it
The foot candles that you stood in,
They are now so dim and you just have to quit it
The spark is over and now you radiate nothing

One of these days I'm gonna find me someone to shine with
'cause you radiate nothing

The flashy friends you have
They never planned to stay up and clean the mess
Illumination's bad
If it makes you see the burning ends

And now you think you can get up
Can't even sit up to this day and day
No one gives you attention to the convention
Of the loosened things you say
The spark is over and now you radiate nothing

You're gonna wait, I heard the news
But you hurt people and I disapprove
Destiny is not for us to choose

I got a little money saved up in the bank
But right about now I'm sleeping in my car
Hot nights in the backseat
Playing my guitar

Summer dream, summer blue
I can't rendezvous with you
At your new place with a view
I'm stuck here in the coffee room

I would get away if I could
But I don't like to travel far
Tryin' to make it here in Hollywood
