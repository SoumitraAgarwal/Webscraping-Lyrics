The Nazz,"Ever since the last time I saw you,
You tried to qualify my life
You never knew the way I live
And Im sorry I was never for changing
The things I couldnt change anyhow
And Im sorry Im not a different sign
And I dont believe in hiding the people
And the things in my past
And I know you dont want to hear me say
I wish that we were together again
We just couldnt make it work on paper
Ill never know why but you never knew me
Except for my name
Maybe you think that I have changed
But nothing can change my mind
Those changes of your own that you held so dear,
To me were just a waste of time
Making believe we know it all without enough of
An understanding going on
All of the words wont change your mind
cause theyre lost when you put the
Letter back in the drawer
If I stood before you now,
You couldnt put me away anymore
Letters dont count
Letters dont, letters dont count
Letters, letters dont, letters don't count","Letters Don't Count [Different Mix, Todd's Vocals]"
The Nazz,"You are my window
You cast my shadow
All in the light is you
All I ever saw in the love light was you
All I knew
You are my marrow
You cast my sorrow
You feel the world for me
You are what the world isn't feeling for me
And the key
Here with me
And the world is black but I can't see my window
You are my prism
You are my reason
You're what I want to be
You are everything that I want you to be
You're my key
Set me free
Open up my mind
Make me be the soul you hope to find
Keep me in line
We know I'm not all I should be feeling
Don't make me fake it
I'm not all love sense
Not all,
Always,
Not all,
Free and,
Not all,
Me and,
Not all
You are,
You are,
You are,
You are,
You are my window
You're my everyday
My pathway,
You're my mind,
My hope,
My light,
My dream,
My sleep
You are my pillow
You are my willow
You shouldn't wait for me
No one need weep for me anymore
You're my door",You Are My Window [Todd and the Piano]
The Nazz,"On a train, I met a dame
She was so handsome, she was a knock out girl
She was pretty from New York City
Oh I loved her up and down that whole damn track
With a heave and a ho, well I just couldn't let her go
Get along, sweet little woman, get along
Come on now get along
Train kept a rollin' all night long
Well the train kept a rollin' all night long
Came a stop and I was jerky
She was a fowl and I was a real guy turkey
She got off the train
But she looked so good, well I just couldn't let her go",Train Kept a Rollin'
The Nazz,"Everyone's got to have a cause or two
No one's changing enough to help you
There's something basically wrong
Everywhere, we revolve out of our time
And we know that's there's
nobody listening to people like us
But for now, for awhile
We just forget all about it awhile
Forget all about it awhile
For awhile
Thoughts of life, lots of women, thoughts of love
These are things that we can't be sure of
And every minute you live takes you
a minute towards when you must die
And we know there are
times when I'm not even sure I'm alive
But for now, for awhile
We just forget all about it awhile
Forget all about it awhile
For awhile
No one's fit to run the world, as far as I can see
The only person fit to run my world is me
But that's just one of my own personal crusades
And for now I'm not complaining, not campaigning
If you haven't got time to rest, then take the record off now

The Nazz,"Think of something I can send her while I'm thinking
Can't remember when I had such fun
Maybe later it won't matter
No spent feelings looking at her
When she's out of sight, if she's out of mind

Something tells me though she's left me, it's not over
Still I thought we'd had a very nice time",Resolution [Todd Sings Version][#]
The Nazz,"There's a hand that reaches
Reaches from a heart
One that isn't able
One that doesn't know just where to start

So it starts to tremble
Gives itself away
Strains to find a gesture
Something that the heart can easily say

Take the hand
It would mean so much to the heart to touch you
Play the part
Would you hold the hand and warm the heart

And take the heart that's waiting
Open it and find
There's a heart that's reaching
There's a heart that's reaching from inside",Take the Hand [ [Todd Sings Version]
The Nazz,"I know you think I've done something wrong
I'm only trying to see myself through your eyes
And put myself where I belong
You think I'm hurting, I can't make you see
I can't love you when the person you love isn't me

I can't stop feeling, my heart still feels like before
How can I tell you to make you see what I mean
I couldn't mean it anymore
If I could see you I'd try to explain
You're my heart's life, it can't take the pain
I'm alive - keep me alive

I'm not the guy that you think I'll turn out to be
You knew somebody with love too easy to say
But girl you know that isn't me
It's not that easy to say I'm in love
'til it's something we both are sure of
If you want me to say I'm in love
make it something we both are sure of",It's Not That Easy [*]
The Nazz,"Innocent angel with your evil mind
But not around to see me plot the perfect crime
It makes me dizzy thinking just what you might do
And if you should find that I'm as evil as you

Magic Me, know just what you hide girl, Magic me
It isn't just talent 'cause it took me years
And girls like you only want to see my tears
I'd like to sit back now just to picture the fun
And see your reaction when the damage is done

Magic Me, know just where you hide girl, Magic me
The spell is very simple and it's worked so far
It's quick and very painful and it leaves a scar
Justice is all right with me
And I'll treat you just like you treated me",Magic Me [Alternative Version][Alternate Take][*]
The Nazz,"I'm a human being now but I used to be a pig
'Til they shortened up my nose
And they made me wear a wig
I'm afraid the things on piggy farm
Will never be the same
Since they picked me for this job
And they stuck me with a name
It's a name, it's name,
Who ever heard of a pig with a name like

Meridian Leeward - that's my name
I fly around the sky in a big jet plane
I'm a flash ace pilot, got my name on the wing
I hang around with people
And they don't suspect a thing
You look like a person but you know you're a pig

I'm not afraid of dying
From some mad man's gun or knife
When I was still a piggy, dying was a way of life
I'm not a piggy anymore and I don't share that dread
The other day for breakfast I ate half of Uncle Fred
I wonder who ate the other half of Fred?

I think I'd rather be a cop
I think that's what I'd like to be
I'd show you people a thing or two
If a man in blue starts beating on you
Look out 'cause it might be me
You look like a cop but you know you're a pig",Meridian Leeward [Alternate Version][*]
The Nazz,"There is only one winner
There is only one prize
Whoever gets your heart is the winner
There is only one winner
I'm at war with a man that I still haven't seen
It's a fight for life, if I lose you I'll die
Somebody's got to lose you and that's why
There is only one winner
There is no second place
I only know I must be the winner
There is nothing to lose but the sight of your face
I can't stay around if I know you're not mine
Somebody's gonna be lost in your mind
There's a line I don't want to have to follow behind
And I just can't see myself hugging you, loving you
There is only one winner
You're the one to decide
You've got to tell me who is the winner
Tell me who gets the broken heart, who gets the bride
Not a thing I can do - it depends upon you
But nobody wants to win more than I do
I can't lie, and I'll do anything to show you my side
I won't lie, no lie
I'll do anything to bring you over to my side
Take your time, take your time
If you want all my time is yours
Time is yours to make me the winner",Only One Winner [*]

The Nazz,"Hello it's me,
I've thought about us for a long, long time,
Maybe I think too much but something's wrong,
There's something here that doesn't last too long,
Maybe I shouldn't think of you as mine.
 
Seeing you, or seeing anything as much as I do you,
I take for granted that you're always there,
I take for granted that you just don't care,
Sometimes I can't help seeing all the way through.
 
It's important to me 
That you know you are free,
'Cause I never want to make you change for me.
Think of me,
You know that I'd be with you if I could
I'll come around to see you once in a while
or if I ever need a reason to smile
And spend the night if you think I should.

The Nebulas,"Bus stop, wet day
She's there, I say
Please share my umbrella 

Bus stops, bus goes
She stays, love grows
Under my umbrella 

All that summer we enjoyed it
Wind and rain and shine
That umbrella we employed it
By August she was mine 

Every morning I would see her
Waiting at the stop
Sometimes she'd shop
And she would show me what she'd bought 

Other people stared
As if we were both quite insane
Someday my name and hers
Are going to be the same 

That's the way the whole thing started
Silly but it's true
Thinking of our sweet romance
Beginning in a dew 

Came the sun
The ice was melting
No more sheltering now
Nice to think that that umbrella
Led me to avow

Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting

Of cigarettes and magazines. 
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories 
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be,

The New Lost City Ramblers,"Twas in the merry month of May
When green buds all were swelling,
Sweet William on his death bed lay
For love of Barbara Allen.

He sent his servant to the town
To the place where she was dwelling,
Saying you must come, to my master dear
If your name be Barbara Allen.

So slowly, slowly she got up
And slowly she drew nigh him,
And the only words to him did say
Young man I think you're dying.

He turned his face unto the wall
And death was in him welling,
Good-bye, good-bye, to my friends all
Be good to Barbara Allen.

When he was dead and laid in grave
She heard the death bells knelling
And every stroke to her did say
Hard hearted Barbara Allen.

Oh mother, oh mother go dig my grave
Make it both long and narrow,
Sweet William died of love for me
And I will die of sorrow.

And father, oh father, go dig my grave
Make it both long and narrow,
Sweet William died on yesterday
And I will die tomorrow.

Barbara Allen was buried in the old churchyard
Sweet William was buried beside her,
Out of sweet William's heart, there grew a rose
Out of Barbara Allen's a briar.

They grew and grew in the old churchyard
Till they could grow no higher
At the end they formed, a true lover's knot
And the rose grew round the briar.",Barbara Allen

Still hears my broken song of love

Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.

Send you back

Looking for searchlights leading the charge

Now the grenade
And it's seconds before the bang
Wanted to keep

Born at the hearts
Of brilliant bruisers where we find them
And 'til we do

I guess you've done the same

Nobody you meet could ever see
The loneliness there
Inside you

Why do all the boys just pass you by?
Could it be you just don't try
Or is it the clothes you wear?

You're always window-shopping
But never stopping to buy
So, shed those dowdy feathers and fly
A little bit

Bring out all the love you hide

The New Seekers,"I think I'm goin' back
To the things I learned so well in my youth,
I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth

Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time,
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality,
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left
So catch me if you can

I gotta say I'm still alright
But when I'm here without you by the soft fire glow
I hear the golden oldies on the radio
Well I can't hide the moment when
The mood inside me changes 

Then I get a little sentimental when they play
That old love song we sang back then
I hold back the tears until the music's through
Then I get a little sentimental over you

Like a fool I find those old love letters
And I read every line (I read every line)
Oh I know you would laugh
But I was born the sentimental k-i-ind

Honey, there's a hundred crazy things I do
To keep myself from missing you
But when I sit alone and watch the late night show
And someone in the movie says I love you so
Well I can't hide the feeling when
The mood inside me changes

Then I get a little sentimental when they say
The same old words we said back then
So I hold back the tears until the movie's through
Then I get a little sentimental over you

La-la-la-la-la-la, La-la-la-lah-lah-lah...

I got a funny feelin' that there'll come a day
That you will change your mind and come home to say
Then you and I will close the door
And by the fireside like before

We'll get a little sentimental when they play
The same old songs we sang back then
Oh when you hold me tight and say you want me too

Where the ancient armours of bronce
Are buried and corrored by time
Strong where those who won the war...

It's just this heart on my sleeve that's a bleeding

Was just selfish and sad

Is just making me mad

But lately I've been jaded life got so complicated

I'm still thinking about it almost forgot what it was like
Do you know what it feels like?

I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy

And just like that all my walls come down

I relate to you naturally
Everybody else just fades away

Just knowing you found me

Of the dreams that he brings from the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sleeps
While the river-bank weeps to the old willow tree

In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries, in a drunken down fight
But in the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who's born
On a muggy hot morn, by the dawn's early light

In the port of Amsterdam, where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats only fish-heads and -tails
And he'll show you his teeth that have rotted too soon
That can drink down the moon, that can haul up the sails

And he turns to the cook, with his arms open wide
""Bring me more fish, put it down by my side""
And he wants so to belch, but he's too full to try
So he gets up and he laughs, and he zips up his fly

In the port of Amsterdam, you can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants, grinding women to paunch
They've forgotten the tune that their whiskey-voice croaks
Splitting the night with the roar of their jokes

And they turn and they dance and they laugh and they lust
Til the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And it's into the night with their pride in their pants
And the slut that they tow underneath the streetlamps

In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks, and he drinks, and he drinks once again
He drinks to the health of the whores of Amsterdam
Who have promised their love to a thousand other men

They have bargained their bodies, their virtues all gone
For a few dirty coins, and when he can't go on
He puts his nose in the air, and he wipes it up above
And he pisses like I cry for an unfaithful love

And the bag across her shoulder 
Made her look a little like a military man.
 
Lovely Rita meter maid, 
May I inquire discreetly, 
When are you free to take some tea with me. 
Took her out and tried to win her, 
Had a laugh and over dinner, 
Told her I would really like to see her again

Got the bill and Rita paid it, 
Took her home I nearly made it, 
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two.

Where would I be without you, 
Give us a wink and make me think of you",Lovely Rita

The Nields," want to be beautiful, so I got a magazine
But it made me so sleepy, and now I'm in a dream

And don't come out of the water till your light shines clean""

How can I wash my sins away with the water from this poisoned stream?
And how can I get my light to shine when I don't know if I can be redeemed?

Her name was Mandy Moans-in-the-Morning
She was a curse and she was a blessing

Papa get your hands off my girl
Papa you best be careful
Or I'll take you out of this world""

But I ain't no angel too
Before you can walk on me

Breakfast and a bottle of wine
The dust in the air was like rain
But so were the tears in your eyes
The way we argued, the way we kissed
Under the light of the moon
Your slippery hips and the way that you slipped
Into the words of this tune

But now I
Wait for a train to take back home
Ticket in my pocket and my teeth around a rose
But remember you'll never be alone
Just look for me where all the loons have flown

It seems every glass that I drink
Is dragging me out to sea
And I don’t have the strength to swim back
And no air left to breath
Livin' on the edge with a gun in my mouth
And a cane in my other hand
It's getting harder to sleep every night 
And even harder to stand

So now I
Wait for a train to take back home
Ticket in my pocket and my teeth around a rose
But remember you'll never be alone
Just look for me where all the loons have flown

In alleys, bus stops and doorways
Well, she came out West, looking for a new life
And instead she found the needle & the glass pipe
She gets most of her meals from a Baptist Church
And sleeps under a bridge out by the race track
Well, she talks tough and thinks softly
""Make me pure like a pearl""

When the dam it breaks
Fight for your life 
When the street is cold

And when you grow old

In a Market Street bar on a Sunday
She'd been dancing in the streets for three years
And dancing in the sheets all of her life
She wanted to go North just to get clean
Where she'd praise God and count the rosary
But first she needed twenty bills for one last shot
Said, ""Can I make you feel like a man?""

And Kansas looks like somewhere in a magazine

She gonna get away from the night and its vanity

To a big white house where you're never alone?
And does the daylight shine down on your head
Or do you walk the night for your butter and bread?

So help me if you can, I've got to get 

Back to the house At Pooh Corner by one.

Count all the bees in the hive, 
Chase all the clouds from the sky, 

Back to the days of Christopher Robin, 
And Pooh.

Got a honey jar stuck on his nose. 

He came to me asking help and advice, 
And from here no one knows where he goes.

How to loosen a jar from the nose of a bear.

Boy at home you should of stayed

Than to follow me and learn the life of looking back
But he'd spit and slap his side
Just to see if he's alive
Then he'd sing his banjo song of Santa Rosa

He said whoa-oh, singing oh Santa Rosa
Whoa-oh, high and low-oh-oo
Then one day, sang ol' Craig,
I'll be free to go my way

And be standing by the bay at Santa Rosa
Now one time late at night
Mickey lit no fire light
'Cause he feared the posse close behind might flush us out

He hocked the gold buckle that he worked so hard for
Landed a job as a stuntman for america's favorite cowboy
Until the stage had a wreck, he broke his neck

You just sit like a bump on the log and call that fish your pal

Well, I told him I was an orphan lived here all alone
But many people have often tried to catch and take me home
They never caught me

Thought that I was a hiding, call this log my home
But the fish and the moon and a sweet young gal
All want me for their own

So I met that gal at the harvest ball, she took me to her room
While I slept in children's dreams, the fish ran away with the moon

You help me find a way to fill
These empty hours say you will
You come again tomorrow.

She would stare across the water from the trees
The last time he was home, he held her on his knees
He said the next time they would sail away just where they please.

You help me find a way to fill
These lifeless sails and stay until
My ship can find the sea.

Hiding from this world together, the next thing I knew

In worn out shoes
Silver hair, a ragged shirt and baggy pants

He jumped so high

Then he'd lightly touch down
I met him in a cell in New Orleans, I was
Down and out
He looked to me to be the eyes of age
As he spoke right out
He talked of life
He talked of life
He laughed, clicked his heels and stepped
He said his name, Bojangles and he danced a lick
Across the cell
He grabbed his pants, a better stance
Oh, he jumped so high
Then he clicked his heels
He let go a laugh
He let go a laugh
Pushed back his clothes all around

Traveled about

He up and died
After twenty years he still grieves
He said I dance now at every chance in honky tonks
For drinks and tips
But most the time I spend behind these county bars
He said I drinks a bit
He shook his head
And as he shook his head
I heard someone ask him please
Please

Before falling in love again you'd rather be dead,
'Cause when someone breaks your heart, you cry your eyes red,
But there's nothing so hard about the life that you've led.

There's no reason for goodbyes,
You're just running scared,
And that's something I won't buy.

So you lose,
I won't let you go with nothing to show but more blues,
And all this talk about leaving is strictly bad news,
So you settle down and stay with the man that loves you.

There's things you learn to live with now that's all but I'll never get used to living without you 
Now I got used to tenderness, we would hold each other tight and I got used to happiness we'd make love day and night and I'll get used to mornings sitting in the evening when there's 
There's things you learn to live with now that's all I ever do but ill never get used to living without you 
Without you, the sun sill rises without you, the river run I thought by now that I'd be realizing what's done is done I accept the notion that there's things we can't control like the changin of the seasons or the fact we're growing old I know I'm the reason that you had to go away I will keep believing that s the price we had to pay chorus oh there's things you learn to live with repeat",Living Without You
The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band,"One in a million in a lonely town, 
Two hundred people trying to keep me down, 
I've taken all I can, I ain't lookin' back. 
Small town boy in a back yard lot, 
Can't make a living with the luck I've got 
I'm gonna leave it all, I ain't looking back. 
That's the way I remember, it seemed to me when I was young. 
But I can still see the leaves slowly fall to the ground, 
And the snow on the trees as the winter comes down. 
Still I go home again in my heart. 
My father worked hard on the railroad track; 
Thirty seven years cut across his back, 
He gave it all he had for what he believed. 
Like every other kid that came before, 
I grew up believing there was something more 
And I still believe, I still believe. 
That's the way I remember, it seemed to me when I was young. 
But I can still see the leaves slowly fall to the ground, 
And the snow on the trees as the winter comes down. 
Still I go home again in my heart. 
But I can still see the lightning on a warm summer night 
And the rain on the roof when I close my eyes; 
I can still hear us laughing on the front porch in the dark. 
There are days when I know that I've traveled so far 
That I'll never find the road leading back to the start, 
Still I go home again in my heart 
Still I go home again in my heart

Oh what a love, to cast away the pain

Oh what a love, to let me begin again

Oh what a life, that'll brighten up the corners of a lonely life
Oh what a life, to cast away the rain
Oh what a life to remove the gloom I face in the dark alone
Oh what a life, I believe I can see again

I remember the day
We walked on the beach till sunset, then we sang
And the songs we played were a promise of love that'll last beyond the grave

Oh what a song, learned from the sea taught slowly to the young
Oh what a song, to cast away the rain
Oh what a song, to break the bonds of fear and still the sound
Oh what a song, I believe I can sing again

I remember the day we met at a place of hope, I took what you gave
And the words we'd say were a promise of love that'll honor beyond the grave

And I wished that I could tell the bride and groom
Just what I thought of marriage
And what's in store after their honeymoon.

And I was grumblin' to the dancers
'Bout how men and women ought to live apart
And how a promise never made can not be broken
And can never break your heart

When suddenly from out of nowhere,
A little girl came dancing 'cross the floor,
And all her crinolines were billowing
Beneath the skirt of calico that she wore.
Oh what a joy fell on the honored guests
As each of them was drawn inside her dream,
And they laughed and clapped and stomped their feet
And hollered at her ""dance little jean""

Dance, little jean, this day is for you,
Two people you love, stood up and said ""I do""
Dance little jean, the prayer that you had
Was answered today
Your mama's marrying your dad

Well, my cynical heart just melted
'Cause I knew what this get together meant
How it ended year of tears and sad confusion
That the little girl had spent.
Well they told the band to pack it up
About the time the couple cut the cake,
But we played as long as they stayed
For love and laughs and little jeanie's sake.

No one would give her a star on the walk
She'd have a hundred if pillows could talk
Where have I seen her before?
She's the face on the cutting room floor

It's no mystery
Acting in school at the tenderest age
Lit up the room when she stepped on the stage
Came to la for some more
She's the face on the cutting room floor

She had visions of contracts
And thousands of people in line
To see her;
Knocking on door after door after all of this time,
Now she's not sure

Up in hollywood
Stayed with an agent she met in a bar
Laughed when he told her he'd make her a star
Where has she heard that before?
She's the face on the cutting room floor

One night he told her that she'd never get anywhere
In her clothes
That's what it takes to play movieland musical chairs
Now she knows

Goodbye hollywood
Leaving tonight on the 2:30 'hound
Sunrise or sunset she won't be around
But they'll replace her with so many more

The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band,"Way back in my memory there's a scene that I recall 
Of a little run-down cabin in the woods 
Where my dad never promised that our blue moon would turn gold 
But he laid awake nights wishin' that it would

When the world was on our radio, hard work was on our minds
We lived our day-to-day in plain dirt fashion
With ol' overalls and cotton balls all strapped across your back 
Man, it's hard to make believe there ain't nothing wrong

But mama kept the Bible read, and daddy kept our family fed
And somewhere in between I must have grown 
'Cause someday I was dreamin' that a song that I was singin' 
Takes me down the road to where I want to go

Now I know it's a long, hard road 
Sometimes, I remember when I stay up late at night
When the sun up came, we got up and went 
In the shadows of a working day, our moonlight hours spent 
Singin' songs along with grandma's radio

Now I'm beatin' down a ol' blacktop road, sleepin' in a sack
Livin' in my memories all in vain 
'Cause those city lights ain't all that bright, compared to what it's like 
To see lightning bugs go dancin' in the rain

Mama played the guitar then, and daddy made the saw blade bend
And raindrops played the tin roof like a drum
But I just kept on dreamin' that a song that I was singin'
Takes me down the road to where my name is known

And you make my world a warmer place
By the sparklin' of your diamond face.
On a frayed spot put a little lace.
And you make me feel fine.
Warm as the mountain sunshine
On the edge of the snow line
In a meadow of columibine.

Oh little Jennifer, I'd give a penny for
What you got on your mind.
Seems like most of the time you're lyin' there dreamin'.
Maybe in your visions you've seen how omniscient is
Slightly less than devine.

In the walls that are keepin' me warm.

My ears would be ringing like an old fire bell 
When I'd lay me down in some cheap hotel

And I pray before too long 
They will hear my song 

And I dreamed of seeing my name in lights 
Grand Ole Opry on a Saturday night 
Standing where my heroes stood
I dreamed grand old Opry on a Saturday night standing

Love works in mysterious ways
Well I could hardly afford a cup of coffee back then
Weren't exactly my salad days
She knew I was just pretending 
To be some kind of big shot
It took her two hours to tell a little something about herself
And that's when my heart stopped

She was just enough Ashland City
To want to watch the sun go down
She was just enough small town girl
To cook my supper in an evening gown
But Lord didn't she look pretty
Doin' that shake and bake
She was just enough Ashland City
And buddy that's about all it takes

A week later we got married
Yeah, I was gonna show her the world
'Cause I was Mr. Sophisticated and she was just a country girl
She wound up showing me everything
I'd ever been dreaming of
Well, I might've known the way to San Jose
But I didn't know a thing about love

She was just enough Ashland City
To want to put the t-top down
Take a skinny dip in that old gravel pit
About twenty miles out of town
But Lord didn't she look pretty
Swimming out of those bell bottom jeans
She was just enough Ashland City
And that's more than I'd ever seen

That was fifteen years ago
Nothing much has changed
Well I still try to play the big shot yeah and she's still dressing strange
She still has a hard time
Telling you about herself
So let me tell you a little about the woman I love
'Cause buddy she's something else

She's just enough Ashland City

And when they caught her all she said

I set out on the narrow way
Many years ago,
Hoping I would find true love
Along the broken road
I got lost a time or two,
Wiped my brow, kept pushing through
I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you

Every long lost dream led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart, they were just northern stars,
Pointing me on my way, into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That god blessed the broken road that led me straight to you

I think about the years I spent
I'd like to find the time I lost and give it back to you

I found the notes to hang them on
I fround a way to play with the meaning of things
And I came up with a couple good songs.
And so I oughta have an easy answer,
I oughta have some pretty things to say,
But I haven't found the combination
That'll make you change your mind and wanna stay.

So I wish I had one sure honest line to say over and over again
Sung in tune and time to a melody pure
One clear everpresent pulse in the pocket
And I'm on the radio so you'll know that I am yours

Listen to the laughter of the children
She scratched on the back of a bill
As we climbed past the road to the schoolhouse
On the burnt crust browning pan hill
To where they don't take sad for an answer,
A place at the corner of your heart,
Where music meets with memories,
So you can recognize the feeling from the start

How I wish I had one sure honest line to say over and over again
Sung in tune and time to a melody pure
One clear everpresent pulse in the pocket?

I've driven this road as a friend
I've driven this road as a slack-jawed tourist
And I'm drivin on it once again
It might be cold and long and lonely
But she's waiting on the other side
And I'm an hour closer to sarah in the summer
And joyfully I ride.

I climb through georgetown, silver plume
The tunnel at lovelands cove/cold?
The lake on the left is a little low
Route 9 is the breckenridge road? ?
There's a sign right below copper mountain
Telling wheter independence runs free/where the weather & independence run free
And I'm an hour closer to sarah in the summer
And that's where I wanna be

In the evening shadow of red butte
Up the lane from the slaughter house bridge
The first cabin the moonlight strikes as it crests the cleft in hunter crick ridge
Up frombetween old red and smuggler
Rising high on a piano bench there
And I'm an hour closer to sarah in the summer
And what lies between beware
What lies between, beware

And the red sandstone sentinels rising high on either side
As I follow the eagle valley
Through the canyon where the saints reside
In mt snowmasss majesty south
And east out of glennwood springs
And I'm an hour closer to sarah in the summer
Where the roaring river sings
Where the roaring river sings.

You'd never know that it was christmas eve.
The billboards and the neon took the place of silver bells,
And the temperature is 84 degrees.
I can hear the traffic on the crowded strip below
As the palm trees poke their heads above the scene
There's not a single reindeer and it hardly ever snows,
And santa drives a rolls royce limosine.

But all along the rockies you can feel it in the air
From telluride to boulder down below
The closest thing to heaven on this planet anywhere
Is a quiet christmas morning in the colorado snow

I remember christmases when I was just a boy
In the morning I would run to see the tree.
And the carolers on the hillside sang their songs of christmas joy
Well, I always thought they sang them just for me.
Now the sun is setting in the california sky
And I can't find the spirit anywhere
So I think it's time for me to tell los angeles goodbye
I'm going back home toook for christmas there

Her daddy played the fiddle and use to do the calling
When they had hoedowns
She said the neighbors would come
And they'd move all my grandma's furniture 'round
And there'd be twenty or more there on the old wooden floor
Dancing to a country sound

The Carters and Jimmy Rodgers played her favorite songs
And on Saturday nights there was a radio show
And she would sing along
And I'll never forget her face when she revealed to me
That she'd dreamed about singing at The Grand Ol' Opry

Her eyes, oh how they sparkled when she sang those songs
While she was hanging the clothes on the line
I was a kid just a humming along
Well, I'd be playing in the grass,
To her what might of seemed obliviously
But there ain't no doubt about it, she sure made her mark on me

She played old gospel records on the phonograph
She turned them up loud and we'd sing along
But those days have passed
Just now that I am older it occurs to me
That I was singing in the grandest opry

And we sang Sweet Rose of Sharon, Abide With Me
'til I ride The Gospel Ship to Heaven's Jubilee
And In That Great Triumphant Morning my soul will be free
And My Burdens Will Be Lifted when my savior's face I see
So I Don't Want to Get Adjusted to This World below

Where friends and family gathered for the Lord
Where an ol' fashioned preacher taught the straight and narrow way

And I remember how our voices filled the air
How Mama sounded like an angel on those high soprano notes
And ""When the Roll is Called Up Yonder I'll Be There""

Has become my life's cornerstone

The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band,"One parrot in a cage
At the home of a friend
Is reason to wonder and stare
Green wings and red face

And a sapphire belly
A racket so loud
As to out shout the tele

But this morning, my prayer
By the side of the sea
Took odds to turn back
To the moon in the trees

Where a green cloud of birds
In a flock of a thou'
Yelled from one to another
It's morning out loud

""It's morning, it's morning
It's morning"", they cried
From the edge of the treetops
To the edge of the skies

""It's morning, it's morning
It's morning"", they cried
So open your heart
When you open your eyes

And the sound of their voices
Together did blend
Forming chords of awakening
If I'm not here again

For they shouted
Never again would they fly
In such numbers across
Such a primitive sky

And they noticed my heart
As it sank to the sand
Do not hurry they called
It's all part of a plan

To the abandoned old prison down by Airdrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill

And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man

Although we are only mortal men
The choice to change is yours and mine
And it all seems cleaner in the rain
And it all begins to look the same

Now the laughter turns to tears
Now the seconds seem like years
Oh but I'm still holding on
Driving through the tears

Only one world we've been given
Earth - wind - sea - air
We're burning holes into the morning sky
And we have learned not to care
And it all seems cleaner in the rain
And it all begins to look the same

Now the laughter turns to tears
Now the minutes seem like years
But I'm still holding on
Driving through the tears

And it all seems cleaner in the rain
And it all begins to look the same
Now the laughter turns to tears
Now the days seem like years
I hear the gods begin to cheer
As we watch our sky disappear

This is my Exodus
This is my Wire
Send it to those who care
I'm still holding on ",Wire
The Nixons,"I would fly away
I would fly to heaven
Tip toe in the back 
If I knew where it was at

I could smile this way
I could smile forever
Vision in my mind
A place that has no time

Come take me there
While the world is laughing, it looks so sad
Come take us there
And I'll show you what its like
Make it rain

I could smell this way
Could go on forever
I'll never clean myself
You can all go straight to hell

[Chorus]
Come take me there
While the world is burning, it barely turns
Come take us there
And I'll show you what its like

Make it rain, make it rain forever
Make it rain, and I'll stay for dinner
What are we having tonight?

When I close my eyes, I can see forever
Never be myself, I could never be anybody else

[Chorus]

Make it rain, make it rain forever
Make it rain and I'll stay for dinner
Climb to heaven
Hang me on the wall she said 
They all go down, they all,

The Nixons,"You walk right through with blood on your hands
As if I couldn't see it dripping
You change with the breeze when you feel a chill
How far away are you slipping
I know you just a little bit, I know you 

And I couldn't see it coming, but I see that your gone
And I couldn't break the darkness
Even staring at the sun

You walk with angels until you need to sin
You only think about me never
You keep your promise maybe for a day
You swore it only would get better
I know you just a little bit, I know you 

And I couldn't see it coming, but I see that your gone
And I couldn't break the darkness
Even staring at the sun

You walk right through with blood upon your hands
As if I couldn't see it dripping
Keep your promise maybe for a day
You only think about me never...never
I know you just a little bit
I see you just a little, I know you

And I couldn't see it coming, but I see that your gone

I couldn't break the darkness
Even staring at the sun",...At the Sun

In a looking glass, who was looking back, I can't decide
Can we take this track
Going deep beneath the clouds of sin, get on, get on...

Can't read this page
It was written on long before you had eyes to see
Can't find my way
I'm somewhere between Baton Rouge and New Orleans

This is our world, this is our time
And I'll see you...

This need to plant deep inside bitter seed
Only if we escape
This city of sin built for you but its calling me in

This is our life, this is our time
You be yours and I'll be mine
This is our world, this is our time
And I'll see you...
Somewhere between then and now
We lost something, trying too hard
Somewhere between here and there

Feel your dizzy to the touch, never down, we're falling up
Breaking free from your cocoon, transformation coming soon

Do you know where we're going

I might sometimes lead
But for now for the fall can you promise that someone will catch me

Cause I'm falling in...into the real life
Falling in...into the real life

There was a time that I felt I had guide
But I'm needing a revelation
I've been spit out and spit on
Can't even keep together my disjointed frustration
Up until now it was a question of how and no deeper
It's the who and the why and the reasons I just can't remember

Cause I'm falling in...into the real life
Falling in... into the real life

Are you the one do you believe if I crumble
You can put me back together

What might be forever

The Nixons,"In spite of herself she continued the story
She continued the wanting, the needing, never quite receiving
Inside of her shell she kept her emotion
She could only imagine the feelings but never quite reach them
And she lies as she leads you away
And she smiles as she fades away

Despite all her burns she went straight to the fire
And the flame took the skin from the bone 
And the bone from the heart and the soul
If I could find a way to relieve all the hurting
I'd take all of the joy from the sky and put it back where it belongs
And she lies if she says she's okay
And she smiles as she fades away

In spite of herself she continued the story

He said Son, we're gonna make you a star
Like Tom Petty, Gene Simmons, and The Cars

Down a pathway through an open gate

There's something I should keep for my own
I couldn't tell you everything
Got secrets that you wouldn't want to know

It's only dark
I'm freezing

And the emptiness in her eyes was cruel to see
Then she turned away and said,
""Once I loved, but love is dead""
And I whispered, ""Sometimes love is only sleeping""

She said, ""I cannot cry
And I cannot give or feel or even try""
And her voice was hard and cold
Then her sweet young face looked old
And I whispered, ""Sometimes love is only sleeping""

Through the endless days and nights
Could not help but wrap herself in sorrow (sorrow)
Through the endless days and nights
She waited for a shiny new tomorrow
Love was sleeping, sleeping

She looked at me
And her smiling tears were warm and sweet and free
And the moonlight kissed her eyes
As it mingled with our sighs
And she whispered, ""Sometimes love is only sleeping""

The Noisettes,"Every now and then
I get a feeling
Like I've left something behind me
But I don't know what it is yet

Like I tied a piece of string
Round my finger
And I hope this will remind me
Of the places I have been through

When I'm down, down, down
When I'm down, down, down

Every now and then
When I'm feeling lonely
I turn on my radio
Because I'm hoping that you're out there

It seems so long ago 
I would see your writing
On a postcard or a note
And your stories would excite me

When I was down, down, down
When I'm down, down, down

Wherever you stop along the way
I hope the wind blows you
Back into my life
At the end of the road
And if I'm only dreaming
Then won't you tear the curtains down
And let the light back into this empty room?

Kissing in your room
Climbing out the window
Trying not to make a sound, but
With my first love on my mind

You see, we were never through
I never said I loved you
Even when we said goodbye
Never thought it was the last time

Down, down, down
And I'm down, down, down

Wherever you stop along the way
I hope the wind'll blow you
Back into my life
At the end of the road
And still, every now and then I hear a voice
Singing to me softly
Deep inside my head
And it sings till I fall asleep
If I'm only dreaming
Won't someone tear the curtains down?
Tear the curtains down

Every now and then
I get a feeling
It's like I've left something behind
But I don't know what it is yet

Every now and then
When you're feeling lonesome
Just sing this melody
And remember where your going

When you're down, down, down
When you're down, down, down
When you're down, down, down
When you're down, down, down
When you're down, down, down, down

I don't know why this is

And go solo
We're looking for
That summer home
Beside the sea
And for the future

Since I left you I'm a gold balloon that wanders high
I won't sing through rainbows and showers
Taking lovers just might keep my tears at bay
But the dam can break at any hour

By candle-light you seem
To deepen in your mysteries
Confusing forces move
At the tides of these seas

Sometimes we start over
And go solo
We're looking for

Just to forgive us

Left a thumpin' in my head
I would say sorry, what's the use

Cause, I'm not what I was last September
And I don't wear the same robes in May
We know we shouldn't do it, but we do it anyway
We know we might regret it but it seemed OK

To all, MC's you're on the air 

Now sit back, relax, put on your head gear
You're waiting, waiting and waiting but stop debating
And release the highs, just let them fly
While I say whassup to grandma, in the sky
Let the bass consume the place
I'm chillin' in the studio, listenin' to Ace
About platinum hits, and how high to climb
And how many MC's really can't rhyme
But I get a dime for the wax I press
It's all a mind state that leads to stress
Them evil spirits, but I can't hear it
Like my girl Giant told me said you got to clear it
So I release and find my peace
Through a beat or some shit, and dream about hits
I gotta keep my thing on straight
Get my head together and wait 'til I get my share
At least I'm on the air

I got a cut for your crates, beats and rhymes
On black plates to pass around
With my nine to five, plus studio time
I got a radio slot tryin' to get hot
Soonbe was the one that said that there was a flaw
When MC's blow up, and they get large
And forget, basin they styles on a hit
So I try to step around this twist
With acts like Green and my man Superb
Where rhymin' is first and the fame is third
So I walk around town with the full cassette
Thinkin' all the times of new ways to stay fresh
This is what I do daily

Do an interview and speak about the West

Allowed to glide right through the sun,
Released from circles guarded tight,

'Cause you're my unsung hero
And I know it's not easy to walk in your shoes

Now I sing this song of love for you

While others long to steal the spotlight
You work your magic quietly
'Cause your not in it for the glory
The love you give comes naturally
I may not have much, what I have I give it to you
This song that I sing is my gift
And I swear that I mean every word

Not if my love can't bind your heart
And there's no need to take a stand

Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Then slowly turn away

Maybe the sun's light will be dim
And it won't matter anyhow
If morning's echo says we've sinned
Well, it was what I wanted now
And if we're victims of the night
I won't be blinded by the light

Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby

that I've been happy since you decided to go,
I need you so, I'm hurt and I want you to know

Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide

Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart 
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping
You just say nothing's changed

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

I'm livin everyday like a hustle, another drug to juggle;

I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like youse the user
Selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray; so you can reminisce
and wish, you wasn't livin so devilish, ssshit
I remember I was just like you
Smokin blunts with my crew, flippin over 62's
Cause G-E-D, wasn't B-I-G
I got P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out licks went for twenty down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
for chumps tryin to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment and he wasn't tryin to hear it

for an assault, that I caught, in Bridgeport, New York

with my man Two-Tecs to take over this projects
They call him Two-Tecs, he tote two tecs
And when he start to bust he like to ask, ""Who's next?""
I got my honey on the Amtrak
with the crack in the crack of her ass
Two pounds of hash in the stash
I wait for hon to make some quick cash
I told her she could be Lieutenant, bitch got gassed
At last, I'm literally loungin black
Sittin back, countin double digit thousand stacks
Had to re-up; see what's up with my peeps
Toyota Deal-a-Thon had it cheap on the Jeeps
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead with six to the head
Then I got the phone call, it couldn't hit me harder
We got infiltrated, like Nino at the Carter
Heard Tec got murdered in a town I never heard of
by some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners
And my bitch swear to God she won't snitch
I told her when she hit the bricks I'll make the hooker rich
Conspiracy, she'll be home in three
Until then I looks out for the whole family

in the everyday struggle

I don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knockin at my front do'
I'm livin everyday like a hustle, another drug to juggle;
another day, another struggle
I don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knockin at my front do'
I'm livin everyday like a hustle, another drug to juggle;
another day, another struggle

I'm seeing body after body and our mayor Guiliani
ain't tryin to see no black man turn to John Gotti
My daughter use a potty so she's older now
Educated street knowledge I'ma mold 'er now
Trick a little dough buyin young girls fringes
Dealin with the dope fiend binges, seein syringes
in the veins; hard to explain, how I maintain
The crack smoke make my brain feel so strange
Breakin days on the set, no sweat
Drunk off Moet, can't bag yet because it's still wet
But when that dry, baggin five at a time
I can clock about nine on the check cashin line
I had the first and the third; rehearse that's my word
Thick in the game, D's knew my first name
Should I quit? Shit no! Even though they had me scared
Yo they got a eight, I gotta teck with air holes..
..and that's just how the shit go in the struggle motherfucker

Hah.. c'mon.. what you say?

I don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knockin at my front do'
I'm livin everyday like a hustle, another drug to juggle;
another day, another struggle
I don't wanna live no mo'

The Notorious B.I.G.,"Now when I'm fucking off gin I'm invincible
Don't love no ho, that's my principle
Cause uh, bitches come [and uh] bitches go
That's why I get my nut and I be out the fucking door
[You know] they might be the one to set me up
Want to get they little brother to wet me up
That's why I tote Tecs and stuff to get them off my case
Just in case the little fucker ends up misplaced
I don't give a bitch enough to catch the bus
And when I see the semen I'm leaving
Bitches be scheming, I kid you not
That's why I keep my windows locked and my Glock cocked
One ho said, ""Big, why you so hard on us?
Why you swear all bitches are so scandalous?""
Thug nigga until the end, tell a friend bitch
Cause when I like you, then you go and fuck my friend bitch
(And you know that ain't right)

You know that ain't right, with a friend of mine

You see, I don't sweat these hoes
I keep them in flavors like Timbos and Girbauds
Bitches just like to play the merry-go
It was me, Dee, the MPV
The blunts and brew thang, knocking some Wu-tang
M-E-T-H-Oh shit, look at them lips and them hips on that bitch
Dee hit the dip, so I can drop my mackadocious shit
Light the blunt clip, and recognize a pimp
Needless to speak, the G's obsolete
Don't sleep, banged the skins in a week
On the creep up the avenue
I seen her on the block, who she rapping to?
That's my nigga Dee, damn he got G
Now she fucking him and fucking me, see
You know that ain't right

You know that ain't right, with a friend of mine

Uh now I play her far like a moon play a star
She still sweat me hard cause I'm a rap star
I be cruising up the block, I be passing her
Pimping hard with the female passenger
And the only time I call her to hang
Is when me and Dee blunted up, pissy, scheming on a gang-bang
She should have used her intuition
Then she wouldn't be classified in that position, listen
She's saying I dissed her cause I'm fucking her sister
A message to the fellas, that really gets them pissed, uh
But she started that fucking family
She fucked my man Dee, so why she mad at me? (True)
Plus your sister look better than you
Give head better than you, pussy get wetter than you

A one-to-three, he be home the end of '93
I'm ready to get this paper, G, you with me?
Motherfucking right, my pocket's looking kind of tight
and I'm stressed, yo Biggie let me get the vest
No need for that, just grab the fucking gat
The first pocket that's fat the Tec is to his back
Word is bond, I'm a smoke him yo don't fake no moves (what?)
Treat it like boxing: stick and move, stick and move
Nigga, you ain't got to explain shit
I've been robbin motherfuckers since the slave ships
with the same clip and the same four-five
Two point-blank, a motherfucker's sure to die
That's my word, nigga even try to bogart
have his mother singing ""It's so hard...""
Yes Love, love your fucking attitude
because the nigga play pussy that's the nigga that's getting screwed
and bruised up from the pistol whipping
welts on the neck from the necklace stripping
Then I'm dipping up the block and I'm robbing bitches too
up the herring bones and bamboos
I wouldn't give fuck if you're pregnant
Give me the baby rings and a #1 MOM pendant
I'm slamming niggaz like Shaquille, shit is real
When it's time to eat a meal I rob and steal
cause Mom Duke ain't giving me shit
so for the bread and butter I leave niggaz in the gutter
Huh, word to mother, I'm dangerous
Crazier than a bag of fucking Angel Dust

I'm all that and a dime sack, where the paper at?

and I'm shooting niggaz quick if you hiccup
Don't let me fill my clip up in your back and head piece
The opposite of peace sending Mom Duke a wreath
You're talking to the robbery expert
Stepping to your wake with your blood on my shirt
Don't be a jerk and get smoked over being resistant
cause when I lick shots the shits is persistent
Huh, goodness gracious the papers
Where the cash at? Where the stash at?
Nigga, pass that before you get your grave dug
from the main thug, .357 slug
And my nigga Biggie got an itchy one grip
One in the chamber, 32 in the clip
Motherfuckers better strip, yeah nigga peel
before you find out how blue steel feel
from the Beretta, putting all the holes in your sweater
The money getter motherfuckers don't have better
Rolex watches and colourful Swatches
I'm digging in pockets, motherfuckers can't stop it
Man, niggaz come through I'm taking high school rings too
Bitches get strangled for they earrings and bangles
and when I rock her and drop her I'm taking her door knockers
And if she's resistant ""baka! baka! baka!""
So go get your man bitch he can get robbed too
Tell him Biggie took it, what the fuck he gonna do?
I hope apologetic or I'm a have to set it
and if I set it the cocksucker won't forget it

Hit her with the gat...
Yo chill, Shorty, let me do that
Just get the fucking car keys and cruise up the block
The bitch act shocked, gettin shot on the spot

The Notorious B.I.G.,"Yea, this album is dedicated to all the teachers that told me
I'd never amount to nothing, to all the people that lived above the
Buildings that I was hustling in front of that called the police on
Me when I was just trying to make some money to feed my daughter
And all the niggas in the struggle, you know what I'm saying?

It's all good baby baby

It was all a dream
I used to read Word Up magazine
Salt 'n' Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock til my tape popped
Smokin weed and Bambu, sippin on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin Duke? duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski (wassup)
I'm blowin up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number same hood (that's right)
It's all good (it's aaalll good)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

You know very well who you are
Don't let em hold you down, reach for the stars
You had a few, but not that many
Cause you're the only one I'll give you good and plenty

I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
The Moet and Alize keep me pissy
Girls used to diss me
Now they write letters cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rappin stuff
I was too used to packin GATs and stuff
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the east coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Livin life without fear
Puttin 5 karats in my baby girl's ears
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good
Uh, and if you don't know, now you know, nigga

You know very well who you are
Don't let em hold you down, reach for the stars
You had a few, but not that many
Cause you're the only one I'll give you good and plenty

Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man I couldn't picture this
Fifty inch screen, money green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is lounging
Celebrating every day, no more public housing
Thinking back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps a Ac with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off, of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip champagne when we thirst-ay
Uh, damn right I like the life I live
Cause I went from negative to positive
And it's all

The Notorious B.I.G.,"So you wanna be hardcore
With your hat to the back, talkin bout the gats in your raps
But I can't feel that hardcore appeal
That you're screamin, baby I'm dreamin
This ain't Christopher Williams, still some
MC's got to feel one, caps I got to peel some
To let niggaz know... that if you fuck with Big-and-Heavy
I get up in that ass like a wedgie
Says who? Says me, the lyrical
Niggaz sayin, ""Biggie off the street, it's a miracle""
Left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me
Just for niggaz actin shifty
Sticks and stones break bones, but the gat'll kill you quicker
Especially when I'm drunk off the liquor
Smokin funk by the boxes, packin glocks is
Natural to eat you niggaz like chocolates

All I want is bitches, big booty bitches
Used to sell crack, so I could stack my riches
Now I pack gats, to stop all the snitches
From stayin in my business, what is this?  Relentless
Approach, to know if I'm broke or not
Just cause I joke and smoke a lot
Don't mean I don't tote the glock
Sixteen shots for my niggaz in the pen
Until we motherfuckin meet again
Huh, I'm doin rhymes now, fuck the crimes now
Come on the ave, I'm real hard to find now
Cause I'm knee deep in the beats
In the Land Cruiser Jeep with the Mac-10 by the seats
For the jackers, the jealous ass crackers in the (car sirens)
I'll make you prove that it's bulletproof
Hold ya head, cause when you hit the bricks
I got gin, mad blunts, and bitches suckin dick

""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""

""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""
""I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk""

So I guess you know the story, the rap-side, crack-side
How I smoked funk, smacked bitches on the backside
Bed-Stuy, the place where my head rests
Fifty shot clip if a nigga wan' test
The rocket launcher, Biggie stomped ya
High as a motherfuckin helicopter
That's why I pack a nina, fuck a misdeameanor
Beatin motherfuckers like Ike beat Tina
When I'm rippin all through your whole crew
Strapped like bamboo, but I don't sling guns
I got bags of funk, and it's sellin by the tons
Niggaz wanna know, how I live the mack life
Making money smoking mics like crack pipes
It's type simple and plain to maintain
I add a little funk to the brain

Scarface, King of New York, I want to be it
Rap was secondary, money was necessary
Until I got incarcerated--kinda scary
C74-Mark 8 set me straight
Not able to move behind the great steel gate
Time to contemplate, damn, where did I fail?
All the money I stacked was all the money for bail

Ninety-four, now I explore new horizons
Mama smile when she see me, that's surprisin'
Honey's is tantalizin', they freak all night
Peep duckin' cops on the creep all night
As I open my eyes and realizin' I changed
Not the same deranged child stuck up in the game
And to my niggas livin' street life
Learn to treat life to the best, put stress to rest
Still tote your vest man, niggas be trippin'
In the streets without a gat? Nah, nigga you're slippin'

What the fuck time is it
Oh, goddamn, nigga do you know what time it is
Aw, shit, what the fuck is going on
You alright? Nigga what the fuck is wrong with you

When I die, fuck it I wanna go to hell
Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven with the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Tims and black hoodies
God'll prolly have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin' my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wished she got a fucking abortion
She don't even love me like she did when I was younger
Suckin' on her chest just to stop my fuckin' hunger
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies
My baby mother's eight months, her little sister's two
Who's to blame for both of them, (naw nigga, not you)
I swear to God I want to just slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit
And squeeze, until the bed's completely red
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fuckin' buddah head
The stress is building up, I can't
I can't believe suicide's on my fucking mind, I wanna leave
I swear to God I feel like death is fucking calling me
Naw you wouldn't understand
Nigga, talk to me please
You see it's kinda like the crack did to Pookie, in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back
Should I die on the train track, like Ramo in Beatstreet
People at the funeral fronting like they miss me
My baby momma kissed me but she glad I'm gone
She knew me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I reach my peak, I can't speak
Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak
I'm sick of niggas lying, I'm sick of bitches hawkin'
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin'

The Notorious B.I.G.,"Remember back in the days, when niggaz had waves
Gazelle shades, and corn braids
Pitchin pennies, honies had the high top jellies
Shootin skelly, motherfuckers was all friendly
Loungin at the barbeques, drinkin brews
With the neighborhood crews, hangin on the avenues
Turn your pagers, to nineteen ninety three
Niggaz is gettin smoked g, believe me
Talk slick, you get your neck slit quick
Cause real street niggaz ain't havin that shit
Totin techs for rep, smokin blunts in the project

No more cocoa leave-io, one two three

And I'm down with the shit too
For the stupid motherfuckers wanna try to use kung-fu
Instead of a mac-10 he tried scrappin
Slugs in his back and, that's what the fucks happenin
When you sleep on the street
Little motherfuckers with heat, want ta leave a nigga six feet deep
And we comin to the wake
To make sure the cryin and commotion ain't a motherfuckin fake
Back in the days, our parents used to take care of us
Look at em now, they even fuckin scared of us
Callin the city for help because they can't maintain
Damn, shit done changed

If I wasn't in the rap game
I'd probably have a key knee deep in the crack game
Because the streets is a short stop
Either you're slingin crack rock or you got a wicked jumpshot
Shit, it's hard being young from the slums
Eatin five cent gums not knowin where your meals comin from
And now the shit's gettin crazier and major
Kids younger than me, they got the sky grand pagers
Goin outta town, blowin up
Six months later all the dead bodies showin up
It make me wanna grab the nine and the shottie
But I gotta go identify the body
Damn, what happened to the summertime cookouts?
Everytime I turn around a nigga gettin took out
Shit, my momma got cancer in her breast

Chickenheads be clucking in my bathroom fucking

Damagin MC's, oxygen they can't breathe
Mad tricks up the sleeve, wear boxers so my dick can breathe
Breeze through in the Q-45 by my side, lyrical high

Rappers can't sleep need sleeping Big keep creeping
Bullets heat-seeking, casualties need treating
Dumb rappers need teaching
Lesson A - don't fuck with B-I, that's that
Oh I, thought he was wack. Oh come come now
Why y'all so dumb now - hunt me or be hunted
I got three hundred and fifty-seven ways
To simmer saute, I'm the winner all day
Lights get dimmer down Biggie's hallway
My forte causes Caucasians to say
He sounds demented, car weed scented
If I said it, I meant it
Bite my tongue for no-one
Call me evil, or unbelievable

Buck shots out the sun roof of Lexus Coupes
Leave no witnesses, what you think this is?
Ain't no amateurs here, I damage and tear
MC's fear me, they too near not to hear me
Clearly, I'm the triple beam dream
One thousand grams of uncut to the gut
It seems fucked up, the way I touched up the grill
Trying to play gorilla, when you ain't no killer

There's gonna be a lot of slow singin, and flower bringin

I'd never amount to nothing, to all the people that lived above the
Buildings that I was hustling in front of that called the police on
Me when I was just trying to make some money to feed my daughter
And all the niggas in the struggle, you know what I'm saying?

It's all good baby baby

It was all a dream
I used to read Word Up magazine
Salt 'n' Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock til my tape popped
Smokin weed and Bambu, sippin on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin Duke? duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri

Don't let em hold you down, reach for the stars
You had a few, but not that many
Cause you're the only one I'll give you good and plenty

To up close and personal with Robin Leach
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
The Moet and Alize keep me pissy
Girls used to diss me
Now they write letters cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rappin stuff
I was too used to packin GATs and stuff
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast

Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Livin life without fear
Puttin 5 karats in my baby girl's ears
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good
Uh, and if you don't know, now you know, nigga

When I was dead broke, man I couldn't picture this
Fifty inch screen, money green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is lounging
Celebrating every day, no more public housing
Thinking back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps a Ac with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off, of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip champagne when we thirst-ay

Now check it, I got more Mack than Craig and in the bed
Believe me sweety I got enough to feed the needy
No need to be greedy I got mad friends with Benz's

Things to make you smile, what numbers to dial
You gon' be here for a while, I'm gon' go call my crew
You go call your crew
We can rendezvous at the bar around two
Plans to leave, throw the keys to 'Lil Cease
Pull the truck up, front, and roll up the next blunt
So we can steam on the way to the telly go fill my belly
A t-bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch's grape
Conversate for a few, 'cause in a few, we gon' do
What we came to do, ain't that right boo (true)
Forget the telly we just go to the crib

Time to explain your game you see through
Sex is lethal, I ain't gon' lie
Means to get ya back, I ain't gon' try
Like this y'all, my girl sucked anotha nigga dick y'all
Light skinned with the chromed out six y'all
Thought they was creepin', two trips to V-A every third weekend
While you was sleepin', he hit you on the box
Sixty-nine code non-stop
Shoulda left ya then, but my heart said not
You knew too much, the relationship grew too much
You knew about the crack vials, means to be trialed
Way I hid dough under the bathroom tile
Waited for a while, thought you was my right thing
Then things got frightening
Peep the scene, sorta like Sam Rothstein
Guess you Ginger, huh, go figure
Never thought you could be a gold digger
Take my dough and spend with the next nigga
Asked my man Jigga, my ace boom coon
Told me cut the bitch off 'fore the shit balloon
Now I'm like Brandy, Sittin In My Room
Pissy drunk listenin' to Stylistic tunes
Or the O-Jays, thinkin' bout the old days

I seen ya Benz, parked outside my sister's garage
Said it was ya friend Rog, bullshit
I ain't gonna keep puttin up wit the bullshit

Who be hanged like plaques on the wall and ya pictures
Scalin' fishes, my love is concrete
Stashin' ya heat in the passenger seat
Of the Nautica Jeep, we've been down for so long
Still a bitch like me tryin' to hold on
Teary eyed, damn a bitch steamin'
Girls steady screamin', ""Kim you need to leave him!""

Told the bitch gimme your scarf, pillowcase and rope
Got dressed quick, tied the scarf around my face
Roped the bitch up, gagged her mouth with the pillowcase

The Notorious B.I.G.,"Today's agenda
Got the suitcase up in the Sentra
Go to room 112, tell 'em Blanco sent ya
Feel the strangest
If no money exchanges
I got these kids in Ranges
To leave them niggas brainless
All they tote is stainless
You just remain as
Calm as possible, make the deal go through
If not, here's 12 shots, we know how you do
Please make yo killin's clean
Slugs up in between
They eyes, like True Lies
Kill 'em and flee the scene
Just bring back the coke or the cream
Or else, yo' life is on the shelf
We mean this Frank
Them cats we fuckin' wit' put bombs in yo' moms gas tank
Let's get this money baby
They shady, we get shady
Dress up like ladies
And burn 'em with dirty 380's
Then they come to kill our babies
That all out
I got gats that blow the wall out
Clear the mall out
Fuck the fallout
Word is Stretch, I bet they pussy
The seven digits push me
Fuckin' real
Here's the deal
I got a hundred bricks, 14-5 a piece
Enough to cop six, by the house on the beach
Supply the peeps with Jeeps
Brick a piece
Capiche?
Everybody gettin' cream
No one considered a leech
Think about it now, that's damn near 1 point 5
I kill 'em all I'll be set for life
Frank pay attention
These muthafuckas is henchmen
Renegades, if you die they still get paid
Extra probably, fuck a robbery
I'm the boss
Promise you won't rob 'em, I promise
But of course you know I had my fingers crossed

Niggas bleed just like us
Picture me bein' scared of a nigga that breathe the same air as me
Niggas bleed just like us
Picture me bein' shook
We can both pull burners, make the muthafuckin' beef cook
Niggas bleed just like us
Picture a nigga hidin'
My life in that man hands, while he jus' decidin'
Niggas bleed just like us
I'd rather go toe to toe with all of y'all
Runnin' ain't in my protocol

Since it's on, I call my nigga Arizona Ron
From Tucson, push the black Yukon
Usually had the slow grooves on
Mostly rock the Isley
Stupid as a youngin', chose not to move wisely
Sharper with game, him and his crooks, caught a jooks
Heard it was sweet, 'bout 350 a piece
Ron bought a truck, 2 bricks laid in the cut
His peeps got bucked, got locked the fuck up
That's the raw vantage, came back, speakin' spanish
Lavish habits, two rings, 20 carats
Here's a criminal
Nigga made America's Most
Killed his baby's mother's brother, slit his throat
The nigga got bagged with the toast, weeded
Took it to trial, beat it
Now he feel he undefeated
He mean it
Nothing To Lose, tattooed around his gun wounds
Everything, the game, embedded in his brain
And me I feel the same for this money and diamonds
'Specially if my daughter cryin', I ain't lyin'
Y'all know the signs

Niggas bleed just like us
Picture me bein' scared of a nigga that breathe the same air as me
Niggas bleed just like us
Picture me bein' shook
We can both pull burners, make the muthafuckin' beef cook
Niggas bleed just like us
Picture a nigga hidin'
My life in that man hands, while he jus' decidin'
Niggas bleed just like us
I'd rather go toe to toe with all of y'all
Runnin' ain't in my protocol

We agreed to go and shootin' silly
Because niggas could be hidin' in showers with Mac Billy's
So I freaked 'em
The telly manager was Puerto Rican
Gloria, from Astoria, I went to war with her
Peeps in '91, stole a gun from her workers
And they took drugs, they tried to jerk us
We blaze they place, long story
Glo' seen my face, got shook
Thought a nigga was comin' for the safe
Now she breakin', shut up, 112, what's shakin'
A Jamaican, some bitches I swear
They look gay
In a black Range Rover
Been outside all day
If it's trouble let me know, I'll be on my way
Please I got kids to feed, I done seen you make niggas bleed
Nightmare, this bitch don't leave
Ron, get the gasoline
This spot, we 'bout to blow
Let's get the cash before the cops and Range Rover cats know
It's room 112
Right by the staircase, perfect place
When they evacuate, they meet they fate
Ron pass the gasoline
The nigga pass me kerosene
Fuck it, it's flammable
My hunger is unexplainable
Strike the match, just what I expected
The dread kid ejected in seconds
And here come two
Opposite sexes
One black, one Malaysian
We in the hallway waitin' patient
As soon as she hit the door we start blastin'
I saw her brains hit the floor
Ron laughin'
I swear to God
I hit Maxi Priest at least 12 times in the chest
Spint around, shot the chick in the breast
She cryin', headshots put her to rest
Pop open the briefcases, nothin' but Franco faces
The spots hot, sprinklers, alarm systems
That's when other guests start to slip in
It's time for us to get to dippin'
I know them niggas in the Range is on they way up
Flippin', pistol grippin'
I know they clippin'
The hallway, got real loud and crowded
They walked right past us
I don't know how they allowed it
The funny thing about it
Through all the excitement
They Range got towed, they double parked by a hydrant

Open it let's see if we're real, we all suited
Beg my pardon to Martin

Can't tell me nothing about this crack, this weed, my hustlin' niggas
Niggas on the corner I ain't forget you niggas, my triple beam niggas

I've been in this game for years, it made me an animal
It's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual
A step-by-step booklet for you to get
Your game on track, not your wig pushed back
Rule Number Uno, never let no one know
How much dough you hold cause you know
The cheddar breed jealousy 'specially
If that man fucked up, get yo' ass stuck up
Number 2, never let 'em know your next move
Don't you know Bad Boys move in silence and violence?
Take it from your highness
I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for their bricks and chips
Number 3, never trust no-bo-dy
Your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up
Hoodied and masked up, shit, for that fast buck
She be laying in the bushes to light that ass up
Number 4, I know you heard this before
Never get high on your own supply
Number 5, never sell no crack where you rest at
I don't care if they want a ounce, tell 'em bounce!
Number 6, that goddamn credit? Dead it
You think a crackhead paying you back, shit forget it!
7, this rule is so underrated
Keep your family and business completely separated
Money and blood don't mix like 2 dicks and no bitch
Find yourself in serious shit
Number 8, never keep no weight on you!
Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jums too
Number 9 shoulda been Number 1 to me,
If you ain't gettin' bagged stay the fuck from police
If niggas think you snitchin' they ain't trying to listen
They be sittin' in your kitchen, waiting to start hittin'
Number 10, a strong word called consignment
Strictly for live men, not for freshmen
If you ain't got the clientele, say ""hell no!""
'Cause they gon' want they money rain sleet hail snow
Follow these rules you'll have mad bread to break up
If not, 24 years on the wake up

Relax and take notes, while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke, gun smoke, gun smoke
Biggie Smalls for mayor, the rap slayer
The hooker layer, motherfucker say your prayers
Hail Mary full of grace, smack the bitch in the face,
Take her Gucci bag and the North Face
Off her back, jab her if she act
Funny with the money oh you got me mistaken honey
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper
The Visa, kapeesha?  I'm out like, ""The Vapors""
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho, the head honcho
Swift fist like Camacho, I got so
Much style I should be down wit the Stylistics
Make up to break up niggas need to wake up
Smell the Indonesia, beat you to a seizure
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins til amnesia
She don't remember shit!  Just the two hits!
Her hittin' the floor, and me hittin' the clits!
Suckin' on the tits!  Had the hooker beggin' for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly love, my dick got rock quick
I guess I was a combination of House of Pain and Bobby Brown
I was ""Humpin' Around"" and ""Jump-in Around""
Jacked her then I asked her who's the man, she said, ""B-I-G""
Then I bust in her E-Y-E (Yo Big, you're dead wrong)

When I get dusted, I like to spread the blood like mustard
Trust it, my hardcore rain leaves you rusted
Move over Lucifer, I'm more ruthless, huh
Leave your toothless, you'll kibbitz, I'll flip it
Tears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the tech G
Disrespect me, my potency is deadly
I'm shootin' babies, no ifs ands or maybes
Hit mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis
After she sucked the dick, I stabbed her brother with the icepick
Because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
But Smalls don't get down like that
Got your father hidin' in a room, fucked him with the broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
Who you think you're dealin' with?
Anybody step into my path is fuckin' feelin' it!
Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy
Stab ya til you're gushy, so please don't push me
I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen
The black demon, got the little hookers screamin'
Because you know I love it young, fresh and green
With no hair in between, know what I mean?

There's several different levels to Devil worshippin' horse's heads,
Human sacrifices, cannibalism, candles and exorcism
Animals havin' sex with 'em, camels mammals and rabbits
But I don't get into that, I kick the habit - I just,
Beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh
And I never eat you unless the fuckin', meat looks fresh

And baby I'm just, dyin' to cock him
He's ready for war, I'm ready for war
I got machetes and swords for any fagot that said he was raw
My uz' as, heavy as yours, yeah you met me before
I just didn't have as large an arsenal of weapons before
Marshall will step in the door, I lay your head on the floor
With your body spread on the bedspread, red on the wall
Red on the ceilin', red on the floor, get a new whore
Met on the second, wet on the third,
Then she's dead on the fourth - I'm dead wrong

Hoes I thought you know I'm smooth as a babies ass
Smooth as Teeddy Pendegrass, smoke the grass, get in your ass
The Brooklyn born Teflon don, wrecking shop
Getting props, proving nobody drops
Words as potent as the blunt smoking Bed-Stuy bandit
And niggas just can't understand it
I bust a cap for the brothers in Nap Nap, Comstock, and Clinton
You know my shit is hitting

Strap say in my hand, I gotta protect mine
Niggas trying to pull it off, pop goes the nine

Fresh off the streets on my way to the penitentiary
Everybody whisper in ears when they gone mention me

Real good relationship with guns and drugs
Because my whole neighborhood consist of crook and thugs
Everything is my own shit cause I don't fuck with scrubs
I don't need you harassing me when I'm up in the club
Trying to hustle a nigga, asking me for a dub
Quarter, ki's, and halfs is what I sling, cause that's what I love

I know you bitches know that I ain't to be played with
Dont have no picks and chooses who get they head split

I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like youse the user
Selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray; so you can reminisce
and wish, you wasn't livin so devilish, ssshit
I remember I was just like you
Smokin blunts with my crew, flippin over 62's
Cause G-E-D, wasn't B-I-G
I had to get P-A-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out licks went for twenty down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
for chumps tryin to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment, he wasn't tryin to hear it
Smoking mad Newports cause I'm due in court
for an assault, that I caught, in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand, cause man

I had the master plan
I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland
with my man Two-Tecs to take over this projects
They call him Two-Tecs, he tote two tecs
And when he start to bust he like to ask, ""Who's next?""
I got my honey on the Amtrak
with the crack in the crack of her ass
Two pounds of hash in the stash
I wait for hon to make some quick cash
I told her she could be Lieutenant, bitch got gassed
At last, I'm literally loungin black
Sittin back, countin double digit thousand stacks
Had to re-up; see what's up with my peeps
Toyota Deal-a-Thon had it cheap on the Jeeps
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead with six to the head
Then I got the phone call, it couldn't hit me harder
We got infiltrated, like Nino at the Carter
Heard Tec got murdered in a town I never heard of
by some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners
And my bitch swear to God she won't snitch
I told her when she hit the bricks I'll make the hooker rich
Conspiracy, she'll be home in three
Until then I looks out for the whole family
A true G, that's me, blowing like a bubble;
in the everyday struggle

Cooks it up til it's bright white, cut it tight right
Then he slings it to the fiends, lookin like Fright Night
Coppin the motorbikes, the scooters, countin dough on computers
High technology dealers, to the users and losers
Half-leg DiDi, try to swap drug for TV's
Stores run out of baking soda from BK to QB

The Notorious B.I.G.,"As a child Christopher was outspoken when it suited him at times he was quiet 
And of course he was mischievous as all little boys are as a young man he likes 
To do everything he liked to read he likes to be with his friends as young kids 
Are young boys he enjoyed life everything that would make him happy are comfortable 
He would do but mostly he enjoyed being with his friends and family his early 
Inspirations toward rap music were the LLs of the world the sugar hills the Mr. 
Magic's and the fat boys of the rap channel those were all the things I heard in 
The house even though I called it noise and banging I know now that it is a 
Accepted musical art form I was a single parent I raised my son on my own his 
Father had no influence on his decision towards the musical outlet are career he 
Chose my son had a mind of his own even if his father was around he would have 
Turned to rap he loved music he loved rap at a point in my sons life he 
Developed paranoia about death and about the dying we are living in a world of 
I'm
Perfect human beings we are greed jealousy and envy or manifested by what 
Others have accomplished in life my son was very very much aware of that he 
Appreciated his station in life on the directions in which he was going are 
Traveling on the other hand there were others who I should uhh use the hip hop 
Phrase player hating and I think that is what resulted in his paranoia if I had 
To change anything in my sons life that would have allowed him to be here 
Today I would have deterred him from a career in music I'm aware that millions 
Appreciated his music millions loved his music be that it may if he hadn't 
Chosen that life style that career my son would be alive today if I could sum 
Up Christopher in one word the word would be generous th thing that my son 
Loved most about life was the fact that he was in a position to help position 
To share position to give to others who needed to others who wanted to others 
Appreciated the gifts that he gave that's what he loved most",Ms. Wallace (Outro)

I'd rather make a buck, drive a fat-ass truck
Grab the 9, two clips, and run amuck

Smack ya cabbage, half-ass rappers, shouldn't have it
So I grab it, never run, the outcome
is usually, a beatdown brutally, fuck who you be
or where you're from, West or East coast, squeeze toast
Leave most in the blood they layin in, what, what?
The rings and things you sing about, bring 'em out
It's hard to yell when the barrel's in your mouth
It's more than I expected, I thought your jewels was rented
but they wasn't, so run it, cousin

I stopped trustin niggaz since Gotti got caught
It's Bricks keep your wrist covered, or piss colored
By the waist got a gun as dark as Kris brother

The Notorious B.I.G.,"It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

When I die, fuck it I wanna go to (hell)
'Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven wit' the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Tims and black hoodies
God will probably have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
All my life I been considered as the worst

Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit
And squeeze, until the bed's, completely red
I'm glad I'm (dead), a worthless fuckin' buddah head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't,
I can't believe (suicide's) on my fuckin' mind
I want to leave, I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
Naw you wouldn't understand
You see its kinda like the crack did to Pookie, in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back
Should I die on the train track, like Remo in Beatstreet
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me
My baby momma kissed me but she glad I'm gone
She knew me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies

Ih.. ih, ih (it has been)

It has been said, that there has been known to be bloodshed
Over bread, men who have bled to death, dead {what?}
Strapped to beds, pipe bombs, dynamite, lead
Money power respect, street cred, yeah
It's scary ain't it? Picture yourself goin out as a hero {uhh}
Picture mural pictures of us painted all over street corners
Fans meet to mourn us, while we meet the coroners
Notorious tried to warn us
We watched, so many Biggie backed off of {ha ha ha}
Biggie's back and 'Pac's, landmarks, history in rap
Statistically in fact; it's so sad to see us re-enact
these tragic events, which lead us back
To where we left off on March 9th
To come from such hard knock lifes
And make it up out of 'em, hit the spotlights
And, once they're on us this is our lives
Thrust out for all eyes to cast upon us
to see who can last the longest
And he who lasts the longest, must be the strongest {uh-huh}
In this concrete jungle, where this dog eat dog mentality comes from
It's origin, which is usually originated from cats who starvin
Or it could just be somebody's horror, that just horri-fies
And applies to his persona or the sizes
in his entou-rage, that intimidates the people
To the point that you know that he's gangster
He ain't just say shit, you just believe it

Since B.I.B. taught us niggaz to think big
I'm been about my business since then, so anxious {what?}
It ain't how we live, it's what he said, he did it for Brooklyn
This I took in, sent chills through my skin
Vicious, I'm experiencin the same sights as him
It's what excited Obie to write these poems
Rollin, goin through the same shit he spoken
Open up my eyes so there's no limit in them skies
When _Ready to Die_ was a sick part of my life {yeah}
Palmin that forty-five, plottin to pop my mind
Then that crooked eye Jamaican I'd so many times rewind
Got me to walk a straight line and get up on my grind
Get up out the system, who could give him better signs
No pop of mine could top Big Poppa rhymes
So possibly I'd be popular huh? {uh-huh}
That's the inspiration I got from my nigga B.I.

I took him from coal to diamond, I molded his mind
Enter the most phenomenal artist of any and all time
I made a Frankenstein, my design impressed
Backpackers and press who said my house was a mess
Critics lashed, said I made a fortune off of his passin {what?}
All I did was build a dynasty, off of his passion
And I'm addressin the adolesencents absent to who he is
The original king of New York, Christopher Wallace...
This is a promise on Diddy's honor, I'm a father T'Yanna
And teach her that with all the drama don't even bother...
On repeat, all of your albums play back to back {yeah}
And I visit your grave cause our friendship's intact
An immaculate concept, extravagant progress
Bullet wounds left in my heart, I'm yellin ""God bless""
Regardless to critics yellin that East/West
I seen the game losin, I'm just pressin the reset {uhh}

Run up in your crib, wrap you up in your Polo sheets
Six up in your wig piece, nigga decease
Muah!, may you rest in peace
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours
Four-four, and fifty-four draw
As my pilot, steers my Leer
Yes my dear shit's official, only the Feds I fear
Here's a tissue, stop your blood clot crying
The kids, the dog, everybody dyin, no lying
So don't you get suspicious

As I leave my competition, respirator style
Climb the ladder to success, escalator style
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all, death controls y'all

My back don't bend, see papi is my kinfolk
Spin out the work, as if its on a ten spoke
Soul benefactor the Benz, he made the rims poke
Trust me they can't touch P, in one touchie
Turn drop-head coupe to dune-buggy
Admire the verses, their inspired by the hearses
That carried my niggas, and had the church mothers cursing
Imagine the glamor that comes out the flow
Of a nigga who still play in the snow like Santa
The wrist is rushing, my ears is blushing
And the diamonds in my chain, big as grandma's buttons, (yes!)
On the flip side, the steel I'm gripping
You thought all the floss had me slipping?
Think again, blink again let me know that your bluffing
Lead give permanent concussion, your nothing

Ha ha ha ha ha check out the fisad
On the face of rap, so we gon raise the bar
A mil on the crib, mean a quarter on the car
Bentley coupe another short of the arnage
Even as a youth I was laundering the stoop
Underneath the nose, and the Feds had no clue
I was pushing keys in a V with no roof
Rich, black, two big guns and no coof
Things at the label, well they tend to get unstable
And that pretty much leave Malice at the table
Or over the stove with the flame to the ladle
Because I'm a provider as long as I am able
This here hughe the most foolish of blues
When I tell my mom the price
She damn near sent me to my room

Gonja, sensamelia, can I feel ya?
All I wannah do, is touch ya
The ultimate rush, the drugs, baby

Don't you know, I'm the ultimate?
To get this milk, you be fortunate
Just like tasting pussy with pork in it
People stop, when I'm walking in
I'm twisting, twisting, I'm back on ten
And I'm talking 'bout like Mase, come back again

My steez is immaculate
My paper stacking, keep tracking
I'm macing, y'all slacking, reaction
Make y'all dicks scream
I'm more gutter then golddiggers with figures
More bigger then Jiggas, and even Paris Hiltons

Damn sir, sniff me like a Coke
Thrillons, me won't give you none
Cintamelia, all you wannah do is sniff me
The ultimate rush, get high, baby

Damn sir, sniff me like a Coke
Three lines, me won't give you none
Cintamelia, all you wannah do is sniff me
The ultimate rush, the drugs, baby

Damn Ma, I love you like a lot

Now, Biggie Smalls is not the type to fall in love
When I just hit em' and forget em' and go handle my business
I like the kind who wine and dine, who grinding all the time
Your X girl was a 5, but you not let up on a dime

What is this with you? All you wannah do is lay around
And stay around and get mad when I play around
I like to lay, never work, put your money in my purse
To the mall, I'll go search matching shoes for my skirt

Tuesday, I saw you in a Z, but you still wannah get with me
Wednesday is the Benz day, that's what your friends say
Me and my friends, got your Benz
Attracting mens, and spending dividence, blowing like the wind

Damn Ma, I love you like a lot
Gonja, sensamelia, can I feel ya?
All I wannah do, is touch ya
The ultimate rush, the drugs, baby

Damn Ma, I love you like a lot

So I guess, you think I'm slipping, 'cause I ain't flipping
Baby, I'm Big Poppa, ain't no need to be tripping
I ain't tripping or flipping, I'm just niggah sipping
At the bar tipping, with your money, can you pay the difference?

It seems like it's a waste of time, that's why I wrote the rhyme
I hear you jumping in every car except for mine
Niggah, I don't jump in cars, I'm a superstar
Face way too flaw, You should hang me on your wall

All I do all day is drink Tanguray
Thinking of a way to put a smile on your face
Make me smile, see them teeth, Milo, cut down to them feets
Chubby waste, my physique, me don't want a freak a leek

Should I wine and dine and put rings on your fingers?
While sex from the next man in the bedroom lingers?
Sex will never linger, hold up, put on your blinkers
I flow just like sprinklers, give your ass the middle finger

You'd better slow your role, baby
You ain't got enough dough to pay me
You know the pen number, just page me
When you're real, baby

Damn Ma, I love you like a lot
Gonja, sensamelia, can I feel ya?
All I wannah do, is touch ya
The ultimate rush, the drugs, baby

Damn Ma, I love you like a lot

With all my niggaz, all my guns, all my women
Next two years, I should see about a billion
All for the love of drug dealin'
Got no love for the other side, fuck them tricks (fuck them)
Any repercussion, junior m.a.f.i.a. spit clips (that's right)
All the time, big poppa kick the war rhymes
Raw flows, and that's how it goes

Notorious!
C'mon, we are, we are
No, no, no, notorious!
He is, he is
No, no, no, notorious!

This for my niggaz slingin' thangs, had my ring encaged
Truck, necklace, igloo ring and things
For the bitches, who see them rims spin and grin
That shit with the v-trim that win
And the enormous fields disperse of rap
On the road to the riches more furs to drag
More niggaz to kill, than birds to bag
Hit the jeweler and splurge the tab, uh
Hops, out the truck like, ""trick, what up?""
Call me Sean if you suck, call me gone when I nut
That's the end of us, get your friend to fuck
Untwist and bend her up, you know the deal
Niggas talkin' real greasy on some ballin' shit (that's right)
Funny how quick these pricks forget
Actin' like I ain't the reason they traded they shit
Switched that 5, copped that 6 (that's right)
It's all good, you know who the clone is
Fuck the Joneses, niggaz tryin' to keep up with the Combses

C'mon y'all

Who that queen bitch, keep her glass filled to the rim?
The notorious K-I to the M
That's me, on Mtv, no doubt
Titty out like what, I don't give a fuck!
Y'all know my attitude, can't stand my cologne
Then stay your ass home, you and your chaperone
Things done changed, but we continue to reign
As the king and the queen of hip-hop, me and B.I.
Frank White still listen to all the attention
I'm by his side, with the chrome fifth, playin' my position
Sexy, young thing, from the ghetto
That bitch rockin' mics in high heel stilletos
We takin' over like Francis
Switchin' our styles like the hottest new dancers
See, I let y'all live to stack a little paper
Be glad I pushed my album back, I did y'all hoes a favor!

When I get busy throw your hands in the sky nigga
I got the illest of the ill mentality, niggas be grabbing me
Knowing that they'd rather be stabbing me
All up in my back trying to take my track
When I used to sell crack I ain't had problems like that
Street rules, watch your pockets and your jewels
A nigga front, throw the gat to the fool
Necks wanna move but's getting blasted
Streets to a flows from the ill ghetto bastard
As I release masterpieces like adhesive
Stuck to your ass, like tissue when your wiping fast
MC's have a hard time believing
I mark with death, hard to kill like Steven
When Jake come I'm leaving, the black man's motto
You got a better chance playing lotto

You know who been the kings of the block, the kings of the drops
The kings of the crap music and the kings of the cross
Niggas fire then drop shit like the purest of powder
That's why most of these niggas little song be sounding like ours
Couple years ago, niggas probably thought I was dying
Now same niggas are idolizing put our face in the shrine
Yeah I took a little time to cook and show you what's really hot
How the fuck any of you niggas think you feeling my spot
Why you niggas getting mad at us, we shit on your floors

From cuttin' solid Purico to stack Fritos
went from grams to kilos
Mac in one hand, in the other hand grands and see-notes
game got my eyes wider than a 430 Buggy
no tellin' what the fuck I'll do for this money
stay posted up close with killers and cut throats
the thoroughest bitches who in they pussy stuff coke
as I cook and cut coke with the bakin' soda Arm and Hammer
palmin' hammers
think you crazy? nigga, my clique's bananas
takin' over with the Mafia
hittin' niggas for they bricks like Gracias
the cockiest, it's obvious, it's me, he, who?
confront frontin' niggas like ""You want it? well nigga, me too""
what the fuck, I'm callin' your bluff, niggas act like they stopped
makin' guns after they made yours
I'm sponsored by the NRA, DOA rules
grin and stand over your coffin like ""Hey you!""
tell the Devil I'm comin', keep it hot
for now I got my eyes on a billboard spot
don't stop.

take the stand, lie for it

let me warn ya, trip against my team you's a goner
infact it's drastic
a couple Million in the mattress
with a safe dick I say fuck taxes
rather endulge in duct tape pig tie tactics
crime pays 
nigga, Nine-Hundred and Ninety-Nine ways
my destiny's vague, will I survive or blow trial?
lay shot up, Puff cryin' in denial
while my enemies smile, buried in style
Gucci suits and cufflings
sneakin' drugs through Heavens customs.

The Notorious Cherry Bombs,"Well the works whistle blew at a half past five o'clock.
I saw the red light at the corner, man I never tried to stop.
I got pulled over by a man in blue, he said what you thinking you're tryin'a do?
I told him 'bout my baby and he let me go, thanks a lot.
I got invited to a party at a high class Hollywood pool.
There were women all around me, man I began to drool.
I weighed the evidence in hand, I said girls you got to understand.
Since I met my baby I've been living by the golden rule.

Ain't nobody gonna put me out.
Ain't nobody gonna make me do like my sweet little Lisa does.
Ain't nobody gonna make me sing.

I was pulling out of Dallas, got pulled over by a debutante.

I've got a sweet sugar mama give me everything I want.

We must never lay our weapons down

To be of service over there
While the boys so bravely stand with the weapons made by hand
Let us trust and use the weapon of prayer
Many thousands miles away someone shed there blood today
With a heart so true and brave they're gone
To a war that's yours and mine let us join the battle line
With a weapon that will save our home
We don't have to be a soldier in a uniform
To be of service over there
While the boys so bravely stand with the weapons made by hand
Let us trust and use the weapon of prayer
And when the planes and tanks and guns have done all that they can do
And the mighty bombs have rained and failed
Still the helpful hand above, on the weapon made of love
And against him none on earth prevail

One more time, boy

When this whole world starts getting me down
And people are just too much for me to face
I climb right up to the top of the stairs
And all my cares just drift right into space

On the roof's the only place I know
Where you just have to wish to make it so
Up on the roof

When I get home feeling tired and beat
I go up where the air is fresh and sweet
I get away from that hustling crowd
And all that rat-race noise down in the street

At night, the stars put on a show for free
And only you can share it all with me

I keep telling you that right smack dab in the middle of town
I found a paradise that's trouble-proof
And if this whole world starts getting you down
There's room enough for two up on the roof
Up on the roof

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, babe, come on, baby, up on the roof
Come on, baby, come on, baby, up on the roof

Come on, baby, come on, baby, up on the roof
Come on, babe, come on, babe, up on the roof

I count my blessings

I say a prayer

I put my hands to my ears
Think of those

And thank the Lord I am here

Guess I should have closed my eyes
When you drove me to the place
Where your horses run free
'Cause I felt a little ill when I saw all those pictures
Of the jockeys that were there before me
Believe it or not I started to worry
I wondered if I had enough class
But it was Saturday night
I guess that makes it alright
And you say baby have you got enough gas

[Chorus]

A body like yours ought to be in jail
'Cause it's just on the verge of being obscene
Hey, move over baby, come on, give me the keys
I'm gonna tame your little red love machine

Life can be so hard
And we could always help each other

My love is an open book
If you take a look you can read between the lines
I smile and say 'I'm doing fine'
Please don't go
Don't you know, baby if you go
A part of me will never be the same no more
Turn around, let's try it
Just one more time

Not heard but perceived from within
A feeling inside that just can't be denied
Says the countdown is soon to begin

But in the darkest hour the human spirit
Sings ancient songs to me
The tyrants will gather to worship their master
But he will be brought to his knees

This war that you make is not ours
You sit at the left hand of those who are lying
Seducing with hypnotic powers

But now your stone cold heart has started rumbling
A song has risen free
And we shall not stop with the laughter and singing
'Til you have been swept to the sea

We run with the spirit that moves through the city
The heart of the jungle is whole
The seekers of truth with the hot blood of youth
Together we're never alone

To love with all its might
The chains will be broken, the doors will burst open
And we shall know the power of the night

So many people loving so many lovers
Takin' everybody to some strangers place

I've had some hot nights singin' one night stands
But right up front I think it's only fair
To tell you I've got different plans

That's not the way I am
I'm not that kind of man
It's not that I am shy
I'm just not that kind of guy
So if you feel the same
You're tired of playing games
Then try to understand
That I'm not that kind of man

A lot of people take their loving too lightly
They change emotions like they're changing their clothes
They come alive and thrive on new lovers nightly
How they do it I don't know, 'cause

If you see him standing on the edge of the action
You think he's only playing it cool
He's only looking for a little sweet satisfaction

Holding up the walls with hot and hungry eyes

Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

And got so far

Acting like I was part of your property

The Nylons,"You leave in the morning
With everything you own
In a little black case
Alone on a platform
The wind and the rain
On a sad and lonely face

Mother will never understand
Why you had to leave
For the love that you need
Will never be found at home
And the answer you seek
Will never be found at home

Pushed around and kicked around
Always a lonely boy
You were the one
That they'd talk about around town
As they put you down
And as hard as they would try
They'd hurt to make you cry
But you'd never cry to them
Just to your soul
No you'd never cry to them
Just to your soul

The Nylons,"I crashed in the jungle while trying to keep a date
With my little girl who was back in the States
I was stranded in the jungle, afraid, alone
Trying to figure a way to get a message back home
But how was I to know that the wreckage of my plane
Had been picked up and spotted and my girl in Lover's Lane

Meanwhile, back in the States
Baby, baby, let's make romance
You know your old-time lover hasn't got a chance
He's stranded in the jungle, sad as he can be
So come on pretty baby, just you and me

Meanwhile, back in the jungle
The boys in the jungle had me on the run
When something heavy hit me like an atomic bomb
When I woke up and my head started to clear
I had a strange feeling I was cooking gear
I smelled something cooking and I looked to see
That's when I found out they was cookin' me
Ooga booga, lemme outta here!

Meanwhile, back in the States
Baby, baby, let's make romance
You know your old-time lover hasn't got a chance
He's stranded in the jungle sad as he can be
So come on pretty baby just you and me

Meanwhile, back in the jungle
I jumped out of the pot, I finally got away
I was frantic, worried about what my baby would say
So I jumped in the ocean and started to swim
My chance of surviving was gettin' slim
So I thumbed down a whale that was headed my way
And I reached the States in about half a day
When I got to Lover's Lane I was almost dead
Heard him talkin' to my baby, and this is what he said

Baby, baby, the man's no good
Baby, baby, should have understood
You can trust me just as long as you please
So come back pretty baby where you used to be
'Cause I love you (I love you, I love you, you're fine baby)
'Cause I love you (So damn fine)

The O Zone,"Ma trezesc cu tine-n gand
Despre tine vreau sa cant
Melodia mea de dor
Care place tuturor

Nu raspunzi la SMS
Eu iti scriu atat de des
Poate m-am purtat urat
Dar sa stii ca te-am iubit

Ma inec in ochii tai, lal-la-lei
Plange lumea dupa ei, lal-la-lei
Esti un inger pe Pamant
Despre tine cant si zi si noapte, lal-la-lei

Daca mergi cu mine-n vis
Am sa te invat sa razi
Si-am sa-ti cant pana in zori

That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, 
The chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning' sun

Take me in a way I wanna go
But when the night is over
You just may not see me no more

All I want is a one night affair
That won't hurt nobody
A night affair

Hit and run, gonna be a son of a gun
Hit and run, but it could be fun

I don't wanna love nobody
Don't want us get anything
I just may not be ready
To fly down with a wedding ring

All I want is a one night affair, you're right
A one night affair and that's started one

Hit and run
Hit and run, could be fun

I have been a lonely woman
Oh, try understand

All I want is a one night affair
Sounds in a hurry
A one night affair
But you don't have to worry

I'll hit and run
And I know you been lonely too
That's why you understand
A broken heart's so hard on a woman

One of these days I'll be alright
If you just let me love you tonight
It may sound a little temporary
Sometimes I feel it's so necessary

I said a one night affair, well, I do declare
A one night affair, won't hurt nobody

Hit and run, gonna be a son of a gun
Hit and run, could be fun
Hit and run, son of a gun
Could be fun

A one night affair
Sounds in a hurry
A one night affair
But don't you worry

Hit and run, gonna be a son of a gun
Hit and run, it maybe fun

A one night affair
A one night affair this time tonight

Hit and run, gonna be a son of a gun

The O'Jays,"Let me just sit down
And relax a minute
Let me tell you about it

Aha, it's Friday
Oh ho, thank God, it's Friday
And I just got paid

Going across town
Gonna pick up my lady
Have a little bit of fun
Just ain't no telling
Where I might end up

You might see me on the east side
Ha, the west side
I'm even going cross the bridge
'Cause I, 'cause I, 'cause I hear
They really get down over there

Owe it to myself

Gonna party hard, hard

Come on, y'all
Let's go downtown
Come on, y'all
Let's groove, hey, hey

Monday to Thursday
I'm dead on my feet
Most of the time too tired to eat
When I try to read the paper
I fall fast asleep

But as soon as Friday rolls around
I lay all my weekly burdens down
I put on my glad rags
And paint the town

(Living for the weekend)
Friday night alive
(Living for the weekend)
Said, I'm living for the weekend
(Living for the weekend)
Don't stop when I party down

Party hard, party down
Party hard, party down

Soon as on Monday
Rolls around again
I got to put all that
Partying to an end

Got to solve that same old grind
With those five day week
Sometimes, I get frustrated
Through the day, take off early
And a cut in pay

At the time, I don't really care
Because I done took
All that I can bear

(Living for the weekend)
(Living for the weekend)
(Living for the weekend)
That's when I party down
Party hard, party down

And I’m singin’ my song, yeah, yeah, yeah

She faced the hardest times you would imagine
And many times her eyes fought back the tears, yeah, yeah
And when her youthful world was about to fall in

Each time her slender shoulders
Bore the weight of all her fears and a sorrow no one hear
Still rings in midnight silence in her ear

Let her cry for she’s a lady
Let her dream, she’s a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She’s a free and gentle flower growin’ wild

And if by chance I should hold her, hold her
Let me, let me hold her for a little while
And if I had but one possession, possession
I would take her from the garden to be mine, oh, yeah, yeah

Be careful how you touch her for she night awaken
And sleep is the only freedom that the little girl knows
And when you walk into your eyes, you won’t believe

The way she’s always payin’
For a debt she never, never owed
And the silent wind still blows
But only she can hear, and so she goes

Let her cry, oh, for she’s a lady
Let her dream, she is a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She’s a free and gentle flower growin’ wild

Let her cry, cry for she’s a lady
Let her dream and dream and dream and dream, she’s a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She’s a free and gentle flower growin’ wild

She faced the hardest time you would imagine
And many times her eyes fought back the tears, yeah, yeah
And when her youthful world was about to fall in

Each time her slender shoulders bore the weight of all her fears
And a sorrow, no one hears, still rings in midnight silence in her ear

Let her cry for she’s a lady, let her dream, she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her, she’s a free and gentle flower growin’ wild

And if by chance I should hold her, hold her
Let me, let me hold her for a little while
And if I had but one possession
I would take her from the garden to be mine, oh, oh, yeah, yeah

Be careful how you touch her for she might awaken
And sleep is the only freedom that the little girl know
And when you walk into her eyes, she won’t believe

The way she’s always payin’ for a debt she never, never owed
And the silent wind still blows but only she can hear
And though she goes

Let her cry, ah, for she’s a lady, let her dream, she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her, she’s a free and gentle flower growin’ wild

Let her cry, cry for she’s a lady
Let her dream and dream and dream and dream, she’s a child
Let the rain fall down upon her, she’s a free and gentle flower growin’ wild

Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy
The O'Neill Brothers,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

I tried to be like God, but when I tried I failed
And every time I fail, and fail

Got a whole army on my case, got the devil in my face

The sight will blind the blind of this our modern time

Oh yeah, I got a beef with the fence sitters
Tiers among the wheat, the cop outs, the quitters
Cut from the branch fruitless, no good
Only one use and that's firewood

Pay no mind to the generation line
Forsake your sect and be color blind
The problem's not Hollywood, the problem's not Washington
The problem's a weak divided church of schizoids Christians

Never going back the the darkness I was damned in
Now I turn my back on the place that I was found in
Flick a match on Babylon, burn baby burn
Raised my mind for all this time and now it's your turn

Where we got spring and summer,
But we skip the winter.
Feel free to enter
The zone of the Supertones,
Where late into the night we just
Rock the microphone.
We lived inside the fault lines
Beneath the earth's surface.
Spendin' all our time
Readin' books and writin' verses.
The earth stated shakin'
From the noise we were makin'.
We emerged from the rubble,
OC was taken.
With the music came the message,
So we rock the verbs.
Still neutral as a nazi
So you forget what you heard.
We never leave the cross behind,
We use it as a banner,
Scripture the vernacular,
Jesus in the grammar.
Throw your hands up,
Throw your hands up high!
Tear the roof off and pull down the sky!
Chase the sun back to California,
Tears in my eyes.
Tell me where you're from,
The mighty west side!
Let me continue
To lighten up the mood a little.
Never number one,
But never playin' second fiddle.
My thoughts are like a circle,
With Jesus in the middle.
Rhyme for a reason,
I don't rhyme to riddle.
High emotions are like I'm yellin',
No need to be alarmed.
SUPERTONES is what your smellin'.
If lovin' you's a crime,
Then baby I'm a felon.
Where we go from here,
My people, there's no tellin'...
Are you ready to go
When it's time to get
Back on the road just to see you?
On this narrow path
We got no time to dally.
Follow my lead
And chase the sun back to Cali.

You're feeling just the same
And don't take even
A moment for granted

And can't say that I regret it
When every day
God's promises testify themselves
Sometimes it's hard
And the road keeps stretching longer
Tonight my wife's a longing voice
On a holiday inn phone

How many miles ahead?
I can't count the ones behind

when they lay a hand on?

from words on a paper.
learn from the shoguns,
Bahnsen and Schaeffer.

Holy Spirit our general.
Weapons are formed
from most precious of minerals.

drowning in an ocean
of apostate philosophy.
We need apologetic instruction...

to halt the mass abduction.

I know that I'm unclean
And I'm afraid to come into your presence.
I know that I'm unworthy,
To call upon your name
From all the way down here.

So I say
Lift me up
From my lowly estate
Lift me up
Where I can see you clothed in majesty and light

Surely this is undeserved
But the saints by your mercy
Stand with you uncountable
Is this not amazing
Isn't your name grace
Aren't you the sovereign God of justice

Guess that we can only wonder why

To say the least it's hard enough to keep it from increase
That's the box you can never close it once it's open
You can't contain what's inside once the seal is broken.

Chorus:
Who knocked the locks off of pandora's box
Praise apostate while they mock the orthodox

The box was opened first by adam and eve
Forbidden fruit tasted and planted the seed
Grew up into hatred, lust and greed
The pain of cain and his devious deed
It permeates society circling like a vulture
The lid's flung wide and we call it our culture

You can't comtain what's inside once the seal is broken




",Pandora's Box

I first met him, oh, I'd say about nine years ago
But he knew me before the day that I was born
He planned my life when the world was void of form
He chose to save my soul before earth's foundations
Reigns from heaven as we speak and rules over the nations
The one and only god-man at the father's right hand
The height the length the depth tell me if you understand
The one and only undefeated champion
The only one who did what can't be done
The only one who can insure saint's persistence
Who swallowed up death in his infinite existence
Omnipotent infinite blood sufficient for what ails ya
Makes scores of saints sing praises like mahalia
Vital signs were flat lined in the earth three days time then
He rose again and ascended like sunshine

(chorus)
Who could it be who could it be the person of the trinity
Between one and three j-e-s-you-s see-h-are-I-s-t

Feared on every continent banned by many governments
Raise your voice against him and reveal your own
Incompetence
Many people hate him many people love him
Many far below him but you know there's none above him
Now there is an issue where I must turn my attention
It seems that people wish to serve a christ of their invention
True God true man otherwise you're anathema
Unsaved hell bound with a hellhound after ya

Deity one in three existing from eternity
Humiliated lacerated now reigning in glory
The comeback king of all time
No matter how dark it gets the truth shines
'cause in the heart of every man lies the knowledge of him
Displayed in creation but suppressed in sin
Don't believe me check out romans one to three
Still disagree you best check your theology




",Who Could It Be
The O.C. Supertones,"The rain falls on the righteous and the wicked
Mine is not to reason why this is
In this I rest in this I find my refuge
That my thoughts and ways are not His
I spend my life on looking up the answers
It's rare that I can't find a reason why
But reasons fail at children without mothers
His plan is more than I can know

Have you ever held in doubt
What this life is all about
Have you questioned all these things that seem important to us
Do you really wanna know
Or are you a little scared
You're afraid that God is not really exactly what you'd have Him be
What should I hold to and what should I do
How do I know if anything's true
I'm somewhere in-between Canaan and Egypt
A place called the wilderness

I'm not one who always trusts their feelings
I don't believe in what you'd call blind faith
But faith that you can do all that you promised
And you said it all works for good
It's safe to say I don't see the big picture
I can't see the forest for the trees
And if five hundred lives
Were mine to get to know
You all could be spent on just this

God do you really understand what it's like to be a man
Have You ever felt the weight of loving all the things you Hate
Have You struggled have you worried
How can You sympathize

I have spoken too soon put my hand over my mouth
I can't contend with You
Your ways are so much higher
And we pass through the fire that Christ endured before us
When You were in the wilderness

I've been learning the difference,
Between attitude and identity.

I'm not who I'm trying to be.
For some reason my bad attitude comes so easily.

And I hope that I'm gettin' hooked.

It's not ok for me to be rude.

Your breaking down my defenses,
And I'm findin' I'm not so hard,
Love is knockin' me senseless,

I'm not a Jew
I'm not a goy
Or an American
Can't even call myself my own
No I'm not a Supertone
That's not what I am (2 x's)

(chorus)
I'm just a man
God's own reflection
I'm just a man
That's what I am
I'm just a man
His son by adoption
I'm just a man
That's what I am

I'm not a Jew
I'm not a goy
Or an American
Can't even call myself my own
No I'm not a Supertone
That's not what I am (2 x's)

(chorus)

That's what I am (2 x's)

That's who I am

I'm just a man
God's own reflection
I'm just a man
That's what I am
I'm just a man
God's own reflection
I'm just a man
That's what I am
His son by adoption
I'm just a man
That's what I am

Alright!




",Just a Man
The O.C. Supertones,"I, I, I, I've noticed how you've been withdrawn
Everybody's asking where you've been
The only time you call me back
Is to tell me you'll be staying in
I don't know what is in your heart
But trust me God knows what is there
But how can I be here for you
If you won't tell me why you're scared

talk to me,
What is wrong,
Tell me what's been goi'n on,
Have you fallen back again?
Where sin is fat but faith is thin

(chorus)
Let it go,
Let it go,
It's not worth the pain and the shame so just let it go

I, I, I, I'm sorry but I think you're dumb
To let your soul have grown so numb
I understand I've been there too
But God is still in love with you

it's so hard to swallow pride
When you're stuffed with sin inside
Pride puffs up but never fills
And satisfy it never will

(chorus)
Talk to me,
What is wrong,
Tell me what's been goi'n on
Have you fallen back again?
Where sin is fat but faith is thin

(chorus)




",Let It Go
The O.C. Supertones,"Do you need someone?
Are you like me?
Do you fall apart?
You're just like me.

Have there been times?
You felt so low?
Don't you forget
You're not alone

Angels are standing by your bed
Jesus is watching over you
He'll never leave that's what he said
Is that what you want 'cause I know I do

(chorus)
I want love love love
I want perfect love. (X3)

Well I pretend
I just need me
I seem so strong
But it's make believe

'cause I've seen love fail
I've been betrayed
I've seen love pass
I've seen love fade

But I know that God is not that way
He doesn't change from day to day
He doesn't fail he doesn't leave
And I want that so desperately

(chorus)

He loves broken hearts
Faith like a child
And now here I come
With just a broken heart
And faith like a child

I want love love love
I want perfect love.
I want love love love
I want perfect love.
Will someone tell me where to find
Some place to ease my troubled mind (X2)

I want love love love
I want perfect love.




",Perfect Love
The O.C. Supertones,"Well, It's time like these
And it's days like this that remind me I'm living in the wilderness,
And you dont know when trouble's gonna come you way
Or when God's gonna give or take it away.

This life,
This life is fleeting everything,
Everything's dyin',
But one day I'll awake,
All my problems and my sin,
The won't mattter to me then,
""Son, welcome home.""

The day doesn't guarantee to come again,
And life only promises that it will end,
And we all gotta stand before the Lord one day,
And I don't wanna die but I don't wanna stay down here
I feel like a stranger,
I know, I don't belong here,
I wanna run and I'll fall down at Jesus' feet and Lay.
I can't way to here him say,
""Son, welcome home.""

(chorus)
But I'm still here,
And I'm tired,
tired of sin and struggling,
tired of almost everthing
and sometimes,
small and cleam
I could swear that I could hear
angels voices in my ear sayin' welcome home.

",Welcome Home
The O.C. Supertones,"Back in junior high, well, I was a bit wild
Pretty safe to say that I was a troubled child
Didn't go to Juvie but they had me on file
Drinking like a man, but thinking like a child

You wouldn't want to know me, man I was a hooligan
It was the only crowd who would ever take me in
Cared about nothing- that's the loser's way to win
I hit the ninth grade and something happened then

And it was a sacrifice
(Whoa-oa-oa)
There are those who give their lives

Lord I'll follow if I have to leave all that I know
You go, I'll go and I know that I don't go alone
Even if it's only me that goes
Even if it's only me that goes
Even if it's only me that goes
I will follow.

I came to know my God first year of high school
Not a smart move if you're trying to be cool
They knew me as a druggie who wouldn't follow rules
My friends didn't get it and they thought I was a fool

They called me self-righteous 'cause I wouldn't smoke pot
And now I didn't wanna split a bottle of Schnapps
Plus I didn't wanna go running from the cops
And that's how I lost all the friends I got.

And it was a sacrifice
(Whoa-oa-oa)
There are those who give their lives

Lord I'll follow if I have to leave all that I know
You go, I'll go and I know that I don't go alone
Even if it's only me that goes
Even if it's only me that goes
Even if it's only me that goes
I will follow.

So everyone I knew just thought I was a freak
I wasn't hard to tell that they didn't want to speak
I used to be cool, but now I was a geek
Like drugs are for the strong and God is for the weak

Everything I have, well, I gave it to the cross
I count it as trash, I don't hesitate to toss
What I held dear was a burden to be lost
To get to the gold you've got to burn up the dross

And it was a sacrifice
(Whoa-oa-oa)
There are those who give their lives

Lord I'll follow if I have to leave all that I know
You go, I'll go and I know that I don't go alone
Even if it's only me that goes
Even if it's only me that goes
Even if it's only me that goes
I will follow.",I Will Follow
