Los Traileros del Norte,"De otra forma no se puede comprender
De ti estoy profundamente enamorado
Necesario ya era hacértelo saber
Hacerte ver, que yo te amo

Que en mis sueños tu no dejas de existir
Que me tienes totalmente cautivado
Con tu forma de mirar, de sonreír
La voluntad sencillamente me has robado

Necesito decírtelo, que tu sepas que te amo
Es preciso que entiendas que te estoy necesitando
Que ya nada me importa, solo estar a tu lado
Que mi vida ya es tuya y tu ni cuenta te habías dado

Dímelo con tus ojos, que es mas que suficiente
Que para ti ya no te soy indiferente

Y si hay un capricho que no has realizado
Y si hay un espacio perdido en tus días
Para que llenarlo con tonterías
Quiero una respuesta y la quiero pronto 
Dime si en tu vida haz amado a otro tonto
Di que no mi amor di que no por favor 
Di que al menos en eso el primero yo soy

El primer tonto de tu vida quiero ser

Los Traileros del Norte,"Que daría yo por que fueras tu la que me espera
Cuando vuelvo a casa cada día envés de esta total melancolía
Envés de esta maldita soledad

Que daría yo por que fueras tu quien me 
quisiera quien conmigo amaneciera en mis brazos
Quien camine con su vida tras mis pasos
La que ordena y manda en mi corazon

Daria mi vida por que fueras tu mi amada 
y al despertar rayos de luz sobre mi cama
Nunca he deseado a mi lado  a nadie tanto
Como te quiero a ti tanto,tanto

Daria mi vida pero hoy ni me has mirado
Y estoy apunto de morir enamorado
Pero voy a confiar en tu corazon hasta que escuches mi llamado

La que me calmara cuando estoy ardiente
La que fuera para siempre mi mujer

Los Traileros del Norte,"Divinos ojos, labios hermosos, la mujer
Que conocí su lindo pelo, su piel tan tersa
Sólo con verla me estremecí, me vi en sus ojos
Color de cielo y sin quererlo me le acerqué
No pude hablarle quizás por miedo, sólo con verla
Me conformé

Como quisiera robar sus ojos, y de sus labios
Robarle un beso, como quisiera decirle un día
Que sus encantos me tienen preso
Si ella supiera la emoción que siento
Que me da gusto cuando la encuentro y si
En silencio la estoy queriendo, se me ha metido
Aquí muy dentro

Los Traileros del Norte,"Cuanto te debo, cuanto te debo
Porque quiero liquidarte
Hasta el último suspiro
De cariño y de desprecio

Yo ya sabia, yo ya sabia
Que los besos que me dabas
Las caricias que me hacías
Tenían su signo de pesos

Haz bien la cuenta, haz bien la cuenta
No rebajes ni un suspiro
Que suspiro por suspiro
Todo te voy a pagar

Ahora robo, o ahora mato
Hoy me pongo mano a mano
Todo te voy a pagar

Haz bien la cuenta, haz bien la cuenta
No rebajes ni un suspiro
Que suspiro por suspiro
Todo te voy a pagar

Ahora robo, o ahora mato
Yo voy a ver como le hago
Todo te voy a pagar

Los Tremendos Gavilanes,"Me cai de la nube que andaba
Como a veinte mil metros de altura
Por poquito que pierdo la vida
Esa fue mi mejor aventura
Por la suerte cai entre los brazos
De una linda y hermosa creatura.
Me tapo con su lindo vestido
Y corriendo esconder me llevo
Me colmo todo el cuerpo de besos
Y abrazada, conmigo lloro
Preguntaba que yo le dijiera
Que persona de alla me avento
 
No le pude decir nada, nada
Solamente pense en la maldad
Me subi hasta la nube mas alta
Y tirarme a matar de verdad
Y olvidar a una ingrata perfura
En mi cara me supo enganar

Era nadar en el río
Le contó de esto a su tío
Que era un cigarro de miel

Su tío que era muy viejo
No le puso reparos
Y cuendo llegó el habano
Forrado entero de café
Dónde se metió Gabriel
Preguntó inquieto el habano
Se fue con otros cigarros
A ver el río correr
No lo puedo creer
Eres muy mal ciudadano
Pues tu sobrino y hermano
Tal vez nunca pueda volver

Cuando llegó el habano
A la orilla del río
Vió un pequeño cigarro
Muerto, abierto y tendido
Estaba todo mojado

no quedo mi un federal

entreguenos el dinero
por que ya nos retiramos

Todita la temporada 
Se que me rifo la vida 
Regando la hierva mala

Sembrando maíz y frijol
Nunca junte ningún centavo 
De sol a sol me miraban 
Agarrado del arado 
Me di cuenta que ser pobre 
Era trabajar a honrado

Varios plantíos de hierva 
Tengo por toda la sierra 
Unos fumiga el boludo 
Pero los grandes me quedan 
Y cuando miro las colas 
Dólares se me revelan

Varias veces me han topado 
Los guachos en el camino 
Pero me miran bordón 
Y dicen pobre viejillo

No entiende ni entenderá

Y ellos vuelven a sembrar 
No dejan ir temporadas

Ni se le acercan siquiera 
Será que va bien clavada 
O será que alguien coopera

Soy de puro Sinaloa

Para ponerme a tomar

Yo no puedo adivinar

Me amanezco días enteros
Y los nuevo santa rosa
Me tocan donde yo quiero

Alegre y enamorado siempre
Me ah gustado ser

Es el vino y la mujer

La norteña también

Pa' divertirme lo quiero
Tal vez mañana o pasado
De un de repente me muero

Y tronaba su cuerno de chivo
Cada ráfaga llevaba un nombre
No fallaba era muy efectivo
Lo apreciaban mucho sus patrones
Ni se diga su gente y amigos

Son tres cosas muy afrodisíacas

La hice añicos a punta de balas

Les decían a los federales
De inmediato les abrían el paso
Era mas que se activa la clave
Saben bien que si no hacían caso
Sus cabezas volarían al aire

En la mafia también hay escuela
Fue maestro y ejemplo de varios
Le atoraba de frente a cualquiera
Fueran leyes o fueran contrarios
Los dejaba como coladeras
Enojado era el mismito diablo

Lo valiente se hereda no hay duda
Lo que somos lo aprenden los hijos

Pero ya no hay vuelta de hoja

Que seamos los mas buscados

Eso es traición compañeros

Los Tucanes de Tijuana,"Si eres pobre te humilla la gente 
Si eres rico te tratan muy bien 
Un amigo se metió a la mafia 
Porque pobre ya no quiso ser 

Ahora tiene dinero de sobra 
Por costales le pagan al mes 
Todos le dicen el centenario 
Por la joya que brilla en su pecho 

Ahora todos lo ven diferente 
Se acabaron sus desprecios 
Nomas porque trae carro de año 
Ya lo ven con el signo de peso 

Lo persigue el gobierno gabacho 
Pero el no deja de trabajar 
A los ángeles va cada rato 
Y regresa con un dineral 

El recibió ordenes desde arriba 
Y los cumple a como de lugar 
Al peligro se acostumbro 
Y por eso no le teme a nada 

En un hummer se pasea tranquilo 
Por Tijuana y por Guadalajara 
Por los ángeles y san francisco 
Y también por las vegas nevadas

El día en que mis ojos se fijaron en ti
No me perdono nunca el haberte mirado 
el mal que me ha causado solo culpable fui

Quien sabe en que pensaba al darte corazón
Yo puedo asegurarlo que su intención fue sana 
Si tu naciste mala la culpa no es de Dios.


Engaña tu figura por ser tan diminuta 
Tu cara es la trampera donde tu corazón
Oculta sus maldades con toda simpatía
Pero tu alma es fría 
No tienes corazón

Tiene con tu estatura una similitud
Pero también recuerda que un frasco en miniatura
Trae mortal veneno así como eres tu.

Of all the other books you'll find, there's none salvation holds
Get that dust off the bible and redeem your poor soul

Not one word of bible verse, not a scripture do you know
But it is the very truth and its contents good for you
But if dust is covered over it is sure to doom your soul

Just tell him that the good book shows a mortal how to pray
The best advice to give him that will make his burden light
Is to dust the family bible, trade the wrong for the right

Sit down, my soul, I told you that my time is up
And I'm falling down,
Got it all worked out,
Now I say to you that you would

But if it ever came down to one day,
One day left in a thousand,
The last good times of summer,
Are the last few minutes of warmth,

Remember what it was like to enjoy our time,
Before we all go back to school and learn,
Before our eyes turn grey again,
And we forget what it was ever like to feel awake, to feel awake,

So is this why I feel so cold?
There's to much panic I've been told,
And every time I show, I see the way it used to go,
I need to see that every year, not to hear it just so clear,
So clear

The nights were so much hotter then ,we all hung out and made a menz,
It's like you can't go back but hearing that just makes me want to,
Call my friends, tell them that I'm coming HOME!!

So down, inside

So why don't I face it, why can't I face it?
So why don't I face it?
So why don't I face it?
So why don't I face it?
So why don't I face it?

The nights were so much hotter then ,we all hung out and made a menz,
It's like you can't go back but hearing that just makes me want to,
Call my friends, tell them that I'm coming HOME!!

So why don't I face it, why can't I face it?

She told me that it's all a part of the choices that your making
Even when you think you're right

No more time, today

Sing without a reason

Picking up on the signals

Time and time again it seems like everything is wrong in here

Lotek Hi-Fi,"A thousand years, they waited for
Someone who would be true,
And now the empty years have passed,
The sunlight shines anew.
Someone who knows no fear,
I feel him near.
The child was born to be a king, a king,
And the time has come.
He tamed the wild wind when he passed,
The birds and beasts he knew,
Until he came to rest, at last,
The tall gates he passed through.
Someone who knows no fear,
I feel him near.
The child was born to be a king, a king,
And the time has come.
And now the story's just begun.
A thousand years to stay.
We wake each morning with the sun
To live our dreams away.

When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you

I wish we could share everything
Just a little more attention
Feels so good but never mention why

Reaching as you turn away

Lou Bega on a trip won't you all come in

With a little bit of this

And a little bit of that

You can get what you see

You can see what you get

And I bet that you're all a little bit excited

If you need a autograph, honey I can write it

I got a girl the smart one on the planet

Some called Whitner, some called Jenny


Chorus

I got a girl in Paris

I got a girl in Rome

I even got a girl in the vatican dome

I got a girl right here, I got a girl right there

And I got a girlfriend everywhere.

I got a girl on the moon

I got a girl on mars

I even got a girl that likes to dance in the stars

I got a girl right here, and one right there

And I got a girlfriend everywhere


From Miami beach to Valuga Bay

From the Milky Way to East Soley

From San Chope to my home Cafe

That's my way and I do it like day by day

In Africa, America, Europe and Australia

Asia, Canada I take them on a meria

India, Arabia, to the girls in Germany

All around the planet you can be my fantasy

You and me

No matter where you from baby

No matter where you from baby

Baby it'll be only you and me

Slow and heavy from dreams with you
You've found a way back in
Once again my long lost friend
Funny to see that after all these years*I miss you the same

So I drag myself to the corner café
And for a second I see you there
Like in the good old days
And I wonder what you're doing ?
What are you up to these days ?
I sometimes wish you would call me
But then I wouldn't know what to say

And I see you, in every cab that goes by, in the strangers at every cross road, in every bar (bis)

It takes a glass or two
For it to settle down
For your shadows to stop following me
Around
I find myself walking back

Lou Doillon,"What's worth seeing? 
What's worth keeping? 
Should I speak my truth

On the look out
And you're waiting for my words
To wash you open

But what's the point in that?

What's to say?
That it ran free
That it couldn't be you

And it's wringing my neck
And you are looking for patterns
In all of this

Lou Donaldson,"I often wonder why he came to me
Brought such a flame to me

And let it die
And if another love should find my heart
It will remind my heart of your goodbye

Will come back to me

It'll still be you

Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head

Lou Donaldson,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams

And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.

At last face to face, and as we kiss through an embrace

Really mine in the rain, in the dark, in the sun
Like the tide at its ebb I'm at peace in the web of your arms

I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you

If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

And what insane and silly things we do
Here is what I see before me, vividly and clear
As I recall it, you were in it, too

I had the craziest dream last night, yes I did
I never dreamt it could be
Yet there you were, in love with me
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you
And you didn't mind it at all
When I'm awake such a break never happens

Say it and make my craziest dream come true",I Had the Craziest Dream

Lou Donaldson,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy

The story goes that once a cherry tree
Beside an apple tree did grow
And there a boy once met his bride to be
Long long ago

The boy looked into her eyes, it was a sight to enthrall
The breezes joined in their sighs, the blossoms started to fall
And as they gently carressed, the lovers looked up to find
The branches of the two trees were intertwined,

And that is why the poets always write

Lou Donaldson,"Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

Lou Donaldson,"Someone that I belong to
Doesn't belong to me
Someone who can't be faithful
Knows that I have to be
Wonder if I am wrong to give her my loyalty

Why should I be a lone soul
Why can't I be my own soul
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another
For I'm not free
She's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Up on my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping

Lou Donaldson,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust [#]

She turned and said my dreams are out of line
And stayed around to watch them die

What you've been getting isn't always what you see
Love has many faces now, but in your dreams of dreams
You do believe in holding on, you got to let it go

This heart of mine is a fragile thing
Once it's in pieces there's nothing to break

Don't turn away from true love.  Oo, oo, oo, oo, oo.

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song

Out yonder where the blue begins

Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?

And settle high on the crest of a thrill!

Lou Johnson,"From nowhere through the caravan
Round the campfire light
A lovely woman in motion
With hair as dark as night
Her eyes were like that of a cat in the dark
That hypnotized me with love

She was a gypsy woman
She was a gypsy woman

She danced around and round
To a guitar melody
From the fire her face was aglow
How she enchanted me
Oh how I'd like to hold her near
And kiss and forever whisper in her ear

I love you gypsy woman
I love you gypsy woman

All through the caravan
She was dancing with all the men
Waiting for the rising sun

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,

Sharing all the joys we used to know

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye

I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

Ooh, did I tell you I need you

You didn't run, you didn't lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone you knew in time we'd meet again
For I had told you

Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you hear me
Say we'll be together every day

Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be,
When I'm with you I want to stay there
If I'm true I'll never leave
And if I do I know the way there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you,
Ooh, did I tell you I need you

Got to get you into my life

Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song

I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus

You've just got to see me through another day

I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end

Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now

I've been so many places
In my life and time

I'm singing this song for you

Is what I hope to be

In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.

Born is the King of Israel!

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

And by the light of that same star
Three Wise men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

This star drew nigh to the northwest
O'er Bethlehem it took it's rest
And there it did both Pause and stay
Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.

Born is the King of Israel!

Full reverently upon their knee
And offered there in His presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

I found a dream that I can speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I've never known
You smiled and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven 
For you are mine at last
 
At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over and life is like a song

Lou Rawls,"Once I was a sentimental thing
Throw my heart away each Spring
Now a Spring romance
Hasn't got a chance
Promised my first dance to Winter
All I've got to show's a splinter
For my little fling

Spring, this year has got me feeling like a horse
That never left the post
I lay in my room
Starring up at the ceiling
Spring can really hang you up the most

Morning kiss wakes trees and flower
And to them my life
To drink a toast I walk in the park
Just to kill those lonely hours
Spring can really hang you up the most

All afternoon
Those birds tweet-a-tweet I know their tune
This is love this is it
Heard it before
And I know the score
And I decide that love is a bore
Love seem sure around the new year
Now it's April

Love is just a ghost
Spring arrived on time
But what became of you, dear
Spring can really hang you up the most
Spring can really hang you up the most

Spring is here
There's no mistaken
Robins build their nest from coast to coast
My heart tries the same
So they won't hear it breaking
Spring can really hang you up the most

College boys are riding somewhere
... tender passion there it grows
But I'm on the shelf with last years easter bonnet
Spring can really hang you up the most

Love came my way
I'm holding the last
We had our day
Now that's all in the past
Spring came along
A season of song
For love's sweet promise
But something went wrong
Doctor's once prescribed a tonic
Sulfur and molasses was the dose
Didn't help me a bit
My condition must be chronic
Spring can really hang you up the most

All alone, the party's over
Winter was a gracious host
But when you keep praying
For snow to hide the clover
Spring can really hang you up the most",Spring Can Really Hang You up the Most

Lou Rawls,"Why should I feel discouraged, why should the shadows come,
Why should my heart be lonely, and long for heaven and home,
When Jesus is my portion? My constant friend is He:
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.

I sing because I'm happy,
I sing because I'm free,
For His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me.

""Let not your heart be troubled,"" His tender word I hear,
And resting on His goodness, I lose my doubts and fears;
Though by the path He leadeth, but one step I may see;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.

I sing because I'm happy,
I sing because I'm free,
For His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me.

Whenever I am tempted, whenever clouds arise,
When songs give place to sighing, when hope within me dies,
I draw the closer to Him, from care He sets me free;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.

I sing because I'm free,

Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;
That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing, 
He bled and died to take away my sin.

And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart.

And guess who sighs his lullabies, through nights that never end

Lou Reed,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Intro/Sweet Jane

Lou Reed,"You know, man, when I was a young man in high school
You believe in or not, that I wanted to play football for the coach
And all those older guys
They said that he was mean and cruel but you know
I wanted to play football, for the coach
They said I was a  little too lightweight to play lineback and so I'm playing right-end
Wanted to play football for the coach
'Cause, you know some day, man you gotta stand up straight unless you're gonna fall
Then you're going to die
And the straightest dude I ever knew was standing right for me, all the time
So I had to play football for the coach
And I wanted to play football for the coach

When you're all alone and lonely 
In your midnight hour
And you find that your soul
It has been up for sale

And you're getting to think about
All the things that you done

And you're getting to hate 
Just about everything

But remember the princess who lived on the hill
Who loved you even though she knew you was wrong
And right now she just might come shining through
And the 

Glory of love
Glory of love
Glory of love, just might come through

And all your two-bit friends have gone and ripped you off
They're talking behind your back saying ""man, you are never going to be no human being""
And you start thinking again about all those things that you've done
And who it was and what it was
And all the different things that made every different scene

Ah, but remember that the city is a funny place
Something like a circus or a sewer

And just remember, different people have peculiar tastes
And the 

Glory of love
The glory of love
The glory of love, might see you through
Yeah, but now, now
Glory of love
The glory of love
The glory of love might see you through
Glory of love, uh, huh-huh

The absolute corrupting power, that makes great men insane
While some people find their refreshment in action
The manipulation, encroachment and destruction of their inferiors

Growing up in public, growing up in public
Growing up in public, growing up in public with your pants down

Some people are into sadistic pleasures
They whet their desires and drool in your ears
They're quasi-effeminate characters in love with oral gratification
They edify your integrities, so they can play on your fears

They're gonna do you in public, 'cause you're growing up in public
They're gonna do it to you in public,
'cause you're growing up in public with your pants down

Some people think being a man is unmanly
Some people think that the whole concept's a joke
But some people think being a man is the whole point
And then some people wish they'd never awoke

Up from a dream of nightmarish proportions
Down to a size neither regal nor calm
A prince hamlet caught the middle between reason and instinct
Caught in the middle with your pants down again

Caught in the middle, I'm really caught in the middle
I'm caught in the middle, caught in the middle deciding about you

Lou Reed,"When I was a young boy in brooklyn
Going to public school
During recess in the concrete playground
They lined us up by twos
In alphabetical order, reagan, reed and russo
I still remember the names
And stickball and stoopball were the only games
That we played

And I wanted to be like my old man
I, I wanted to grow up just like my old man
I wanted to be like my old man

I wanted to dress like, I wanted to be just like
I wanted to act like my old man
I wanted to be like, I wanted to act like
I wanted to be just like my old man

And then like everyone else I started to grow
And I didn't want to be like my father anymore
I was sick of his bullying
And having to hide under a desk on the floor
And when he beat my mother
It made me so mad I could choke

And I didn't want to be like my old man
I, I didn't even want to look like my old man
I didn't even want to seem like my old man

A son watches his father, being cruel to his mother
And makes a vow to return only when
He is so much richer, in every way so much bigger that -
- the old man will never hit anyone again

Like my old man (just like my old man)
Like my old man
Like my old man (just like my old man)
Like my old man
And can you believe what he said to me
He said, ""lou, act like a man"" (walk like a man)
Why don't you act just like a man
Act like your daddy, act like a man (just like my old man)
Oh, why don't you act just like a man
Like your old man (walk like a man)
(just like my old man)
(just like my old man)

Lou Reed,"Some like wine and some like hops
But what I really love is my scotch
It's the power, the power of positive drinking

Some people ruin their drinks with ice
And then they, they ask you for advice
They tell you, I've never told anyone else before

They say, candy is dandy but liquor makes quipsters
And I don't like mixers, or sippers or sob sisters
You know, you have to be real careful where you sit down
In a bar these days

And then some people drink to unleash their libidos
And other people drink to prop up their egos
It's my burdon, man, people say
I have the kind of face you can trust

The pow-pow-pow-pow-power of positive drinking
The pow-pow-pow-pow-power of positive
The pow-pow-pow-pow-power of positive
The pow-pow-pow-pow-power of positive
The pow-pow-pow-pow-power of positive drinking

Some people say, alcohol makes you less lucid
And think that's true if you're kind of stupid
I'm not that kind that get's himself burned twice

And some say liquor kills the cells in your head
And for that matter so does getting out of bed
When I exit, I'll go out gracefully, shot in my hand

Lou Reed,"Smiles, I was taught never to smile
I was told the stylish smiles of buffoonery
Chicanery and larceny abound

My mom said unless someone sticks you right in front of a camera
A smile is the last thing that you wanna do
Those smiles, those mirthless toothy smiles

Smiles, they all smile on tv
The quizmaster with his withered crones
The talkshow hosting movie stars, the politician licking feet

The mugger, the rapist, the arsonic lover
All smile out from the news, at one time or another
Those smiles, those garish sickly smiles

When I was young my mother said to me
Never, ever, let anyone see that you're happy

Smiles, never, ever let them see you smile
They'll always put you down
With those smiles, never, ever let them see you smile
They'll always put you down
With your smiles, never, ever let them see you smile
Don't you know they'll make you go

Will you please take your hat off

Listen to her cough

Can't you show some respect please
Although you didn't in real life
Your mother is dying
And I God damn well hope you're satisfied

We were always standing on ceremony

So please play another song on that juke box
Please play another pretty sad song for me
And if that phone rings, tell them that you haven't seen me
If that last phone rings
Tell them that you haven't seen me for weeks

Lou Reed,"You feel so lonely, when it's in the afternoon,
And you gotta face it, all through the night.
Don't it make you believe
That something's gonna have to happen soon?
Oh, baby, all through the night,
All through the night.
Oh, baby, all through the night,
All through the night.
All through the night.

Have you ever played with an all-night band,
And got through it, baby, all through the night,
With a daytime of sin and a night time of hell?
Everybody's gonna look for a bell to ring,
All through the night.
And they do it, all through the night, baby,
All through the night.

When the words pour down and the poetry comes,
And the novel's written, and the book is done.
You say: ""oh, Lord, lover, baby, give it to me,""
All through the night.
And she says it.

Best friend Sally, she got sick,
And I'm feeling mighty ill, myself.
It happens all the time, and all through the night.
I went to Saint Vincent's,
And I'm watching the ceiling fall down on her body,
As she's lying 'round on the ground.

Said: ""oh, babe got to celebrate,"" all through the night.
Made me feel so sad, I cried all through the night.
I said: ""oh, Jesus,"" all through the night.
If the sinner's in and the good man's gone,
Then a woman can't come and help him home.

Then what're gonna do about it,
When they go on all through the night?
All they sing: ""oh, baby, oh, baby, oh, baby,""
All through the night.

And he says: ""give it to me,"" all through the night.
It ain't so much when a man's gotta cry
To get a little loving, and some peace of mind.
Said: ""hey, baby give it to me,"" all through the night.
Some people wait for things that never come,
And some people dream of things, they've never been done.
They do it, oh, baby, all through the night.

The city's funny and the country's wide,
But I want to know why they don't have a right?
Don't they do it, oh, baby, all through the night?
Oh, mama, oh, mama, tell me 'bout it,
All through the night.
I want to have it all through the night.
Christmas comes only once a year.

Why can't anybody shed just one tear?
For things that don't happen all through the night.

You can arrest me if I'm not at home
And if I don't keep my word I swear

Here's Shakespeare's ""Measure For Measure""

And it caused his brain to holler

Wash the razor in the rain
Let me luxuriate in pain
Please don't set me free

He knew he was alive
He put a pin through the nipples on his chest
He thought he was a saint

It cannot be controlled

This is no play you're thinking you are in
What will you say

And look me in the eye
I get a thrill from punishment
I've always been that way

I loathe and despise repentance
You are permanently stained
Your weakness buys indifference
And indiscretion in the streets
Dirty's what you are and clean is what you're not
You deserve to be soundly beat

Cut the stallion at his mount
And stuff it in his mouth

My heart's nearly bursting, my chest's choking tight

Waves of fear, waves of fear

Waves of fear, squat on the floor
Looking for some pill, the liquor is gone
Blood trips from my nose, I can barely breathe
Waves of fear, I'm too scared to leave

Waves of fear, waves of fear
Waves of fear, waves of fear

I'm too afraid to use the phone
I'm too afraid to put the light on
I'm so afraid I've lost control
I'm suffocating without a word

Crazy with sweat, spittle on my jaw
What's that funny noise, what's that on the floor
Waves of fear, pulsing with death
I curse my tremors, I jump at my own step
I cringe at my terror, I hate my own smell
I know where I must be, I must be in hell

Lou Reed,"I love women, I think they are great
They're a solace to the world in a terrible state
They're a blessing to the eyes, a balm to soul
What a nightmare to have no women in the world

I love women ...
We all love women

I used to look at women in the magazines
I know that it was sexist, but I was on the sly
I couldn't keep my hands off women
And I won't till I die

I love women ...
We all love women

A woman's love can lift you up, and women can inspire
I feel like buying flowers and hiring a celestial choir
A choir of castratis to serenade my love
They'd sing a little Bach for us and then we'd make love

I love women
I love women
We all love women
We love women

Lou Reed,"I'm cruising fast on a motorcycle down this winding country road
And I pass the gravel on the foot of the hill
Where last week I fell off
There's still some oil by the old elm tree
And a dead squirrel that I hit
But if I hadn't left, I would've struck you dead
So I took a ride instead
Bottoming out, bottoming out
I'm bottoming out, bottoming out
My doctor says she hopes I know how lucky I can be
After all, it wasn't my blood mixed in the dirt that night
And we must really examine this
And I say I need another drink
Bottoming out
I'm tearing down Route Eighty East
The sun's on my right side
I'm drunk, but my vision's good, and I think of my child bride
I aim that bike at the fat pothole beyond that underpass

Lou Reed,"A perfect day to get out of bed
Shower, dress, shave, kiss you on the head
Then I hit the office, and my head starts to swim
A perfect day to just walk around

When I hear a phone ring, my heart starts to beat
When I get home, I don't want you to speak
Don't talk to me about work
Please don't talk to me about work

With work, with work

How many liars, how many tales
How many insults must you take in this one life?

So please excuse me if I get this way
But I have got obligations to keep
So be very careful when you speak

Lou Reed,"If I could be anything in the world that flew
I would be a bat and come swooping after you
And if the last time you were here, things were a bit askew
Well, you know what happens after dark
When rattlesnakes loose their skins and their hearts
And all the missionaries loose their bark
All the trees are calling after you
And all the venom snipers after you
Are all the mountains boulder after you

If I could be anything of the things in this world that bite
Instead of being a tethered ocelot on a leash
I'd rather be your kite
And be tied to the end of your string
And flying in the air, babe, at night
Because you know what they say about honey bears
When you shave off all their baby hair
You've got a hairy minded big bare bear
And all the bells are rolling out for you
And stones are all erupting out for you
And all the cheap bloodsuckers are flying after you

Yesterday, Daisy Mae and Biff were grooving down the street
And just like in a movie, her hands became her feet
Her belly button was her mouth
Which meant she tasted what she'd speak
But the funny thing is what happened to her nose
It grew until it reached all of her toes
Now, when people say her feet smell, they mean her nose
And curtains laced with diamonds, dear, for you
And kingdom's Christian sailors (soldiers), dear, for you
And melting ice cap mountains, dear, for you
And knights in flaming silver robes for you

And she had sex in the hall

Lou Reed,"Betrayed, by the one who says she loves you
By the one who says she needs you - above all other men
Betrayed, by her fragile, vicious beauty
Her father did his duty and I lie down betrayed

Justice taught her confidence, her mother was like steel
Her cousins, they're all convicts
She alone rose above that wheel
But a motorcyclist, no matter how good
Is slave to the oncoming truck
And the poison of her father was her most pitiless luck

Betrayed, by the one who says she loves you
By the one who says she needs you - above all other men
Betrayed, by her fragile, vicious beauty
Her father did his duty and I lay down betrayed

Three of us lie in his bed - night of infamy
One of us lies on our back - her father's in her head
And quick she turns and slaps my face
And with her eyes open wide she screams
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you
But she's looking right by me

There were some country folk and some hunters inside
somebody got themselves married and somebody died
I went to the juke box and played a hillbilly song

They was arguing about football as I waved and went outside
and I headed for the mountains feeling warm inside
I love that GPZ so much, you know that I could kiss her

Lou Reed,"If you gave up major vices
You're between a hard place and a wall
And your car breaks down in traffic on the street
Remember, I'm the one who loves you
You can always give me a call
Turn to me, turn to me, turn to me

If you father is freebasing and your mother turning tricks
That's still no reason that you should have a rip
Remember, I'm the one who loves you
You can always give me a call
Turn to me, turn to me, turn to me

When your teeth are ground down to the bone
And there's nothing between your legs
And some friend died of something that you can't pronounce
Remember, I'm the one who loves you
You can always give me a call
Turn to me, turn to me, turn to me

You can't pay your rent
Your boss is an idiot
Your apartment has no heat
Your wife says: Maybe it's time to have a child
Remember, I'm the one who loves you
You can always give me a call
Turn to me, turn to me, turn to me

What it's all too much
You turn the TV set on and light a cigarette
Then a public service announcement comes creeping on
You see a lung corroding or a fatal heart attack
Turn to me, turn to me, turn to me",Turn to Me

I'd teach 'em how to plant a bomb, start a fire, play guitar

talking crippled on the Cross
Was his mind reeling and heaving hallucinating
fleeing what a loss

The things he hadn't touched or kissed his senses
slowly stripped away
Not like Buddha not like Vishnu
life wouldn't rise through him again

I find it easy to believe
that he might question his beliefs
The beginning of the Last Temptation

The duality of nature, Godly nature,
human nature splits the soul
Fully human, fully divine and divided
the great immortal soul

Split into pieces, whirling pieces, opposites
attract
From the front, the side, the back
the mind itself attacks

I know the feeling, I know it from before
Descartes through Hegel belief is never sure

I was sitting drumming thinking thumping pondering
the Mysteries of Life
Outside the city shrieking screaming whispering

at St. Patrick's the bells will ring for you
Ah, what must you have been thinking
when you realized the time had come for you

on so much Human and so much less Divine

Lou Reed,"The bias of the father runs on through the son
And leaves him bothered and bewildered
The drugs in his veins only cause him to spit
At the face staring back in the mirror
How can he tell a good act from the bad
He can't even remember his name
How can he do what needs to be done
When he's a follower not a leader
The sickness of the mother runs on through the girl
Leaving her small and helpless
Liquor flies through her brain with the force of a gun
Leaving her running in circles
How she can tell a good act from the bad
When she's flat on her back in her room
How can she do what needs to be done
When she's a coward and a bleeder
The man if he marries his child
And have endless excuses
The woman sadly will do much the same
Thinking that it's right and it's proper
Better than their mommy or their daddy did
Better than the childhood they suffered
The truth is they're happier when they're in pain
In fact, that's why they got married",Endless Cycle

and Pontiff how are you?
You have so much in common
in the things you do

And here comes Jesse Jackson
he talks of Common Ground
does that Common Ground include me

A sound that shakes
oh Jesse, you must watch the sounds you make

A sound that quakes
there are fears that still reverberate

Jesse you say Common Ground
does that include the PLO?
what about people right here right now
who fought for you not so long ago?

The words that flow so freely
falling dancing from your lips
I hope that you don't cheapen them
with a racist slip

Oh Common Ground
is Common Ground a word or just a sound
Common Ground
remember those civil rights workers buried in the ground

If I ran for President
and once was a member of the Klan
wouldn't you call me on it
the way I call you on Farrakhan

And Pontiff, pretty Pontiff
can anyone shake your hand ?
or is it just that you like uniforms
and someone kissing your hand

Or is it true
the Common Ground for me includes you too

Oh, oh, is it true
the Common Ground for me includes you too

Good evening Mr.Waldheim
pontiff how are you
as you both stroll through the woods at night
I'm thinking thoughts of you

And Jesse you're inside my thoughts
as the rhythmic words subside

or do you prefer to wait outside

as she cruises Christopher Street
And some Southern Queen is acting loud and mean
where the docks and the Badlands meet

Especially to be here without you

There's a Greta Garbo and an Alfred Hitchcock
and some black Jamaican stud
There's five Cinderellas and some leather drags
I almost fell into my mug

There's a Crawford, Davis and a tacky Cary Grant
And some Homeboys lookin' for trouble down here from the Bronx

But there ain't no Hairy and no Virgin Mary
you won't hear those voices again
And Johnny Rio and Rotten Rita
you'll never see those faces again

This Halloween is something to be sure
Especially to be here without you

There's the Born Again Losers and the Lavender Boozers
and some crack team from Washington Heights
The boys from Avenue B and the girls from Avenue D
a Tinkerbell in tights

This celebration somehow get me down
Especially when I see you're not around

There's no Peter Pedantic saying things romantic
in Latin, Greek or Spic
There's no Three bananas or Brandy Alexander
dishing all their tricks

It's a different feeling that I have today
Especially when I know you've gone away

There's a girl from Soho with a teeshirt saying ""I Blow""
she's with the ""jive five 2 plus 3""
And the girls for pay dates are giving cut rates
or else doing it for free

The past keeps knock, knock, knocking on my door
And I don't want to hear it anymore

No consolations please for feelin' funky
I got to get my head above my knees
But it makes me mad and mad makes me sad
and then I start to freeze

In the back of my mind I was afraid it might be true
In the back of my mind I was afraid that they meant you

Central Park last week
The fathers are lined up by
the coffins by the Statue of Bigotry
You better hold on something's happening here
You better hold on---meet you in Tompkins Square
The dopers sent a message to the cops last weekend
They shot him in the car where he sat
And Eleanor Bumpres and Michael Stewart must have appreciated that
There's a rampaging rage rising up like a plague of bloody vials
washing up on the beach
It'll take more than the Angels or Iron Mike Tyson
to heal this bloody breach
A junkie ran down a lady a pregnant dancer
she'll never dance but the baby was saved
He shot up some China White and nodded out at the wheel
and he doesn't even remember a thing
They shot that old lady
'cause they thought she was a witness
to a crime she didn't even see
Whose home is the home of the brave by the Statue of Bigotry

Betwixt between the East and west he calls on her wearing a leather vest
the earth squeals and shudders to a halt

that he has left his soul in someone's rented car
Inside his pants he hides a mop to clean the mess that he has dropped
into the life of lithesome Juliette Bell
And Romeo wanted Juliette

Romeo Rodriguez squares his shoulders and curses Jesus
runs a comb through his black pony-tail
He's thinking of his lonely room
the sink that by his bed gives off a stink
Then smells her perfume in his eyes
and her voice was like a bell
Outside the streets were steaming the crack dealers were dreaming
of an Uzi someone had just scored
I betcha I could hit that light with my one good arm behind my back

Brother give me another tote those downtown hoods are no damn good

I'll take Manhattan in a garbage bag with Latin written on it that says
""It's hard to give a shit these days""

Suitcase in my hand.
Jack's in his car, says to Jane, who's in her vest,
Me, babe, I'm in a rock n' roll band.
Ridin' in a Stutz Bearcat, Jim,
Those were different times.
And the poets studied rows of verse, 
And all the ladies rolled their eyes

Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane

Now, Jack, he is a banker, 
And Jane, she is a clerk.
And the both of them are saving up their money...
Then they come home from work.
Sittin' by the fire...
Radio just played a little classical music for you kids,
The march of the wooden soldiers
And you can hear Jack say

Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane

Some people like to go out dancing
And other people, (like us) they gotta work
And there's always some evil mothers
They'll tell you life is full of dirt.
And the women never really faint, 
And the villans always blink their eyes.
And the children are the only ones who blush.
'Cause life is just to die.
But, anyone who has a heart
Wouldn't want to turn around and break it
And anyone who ever played the part
He wouldn't want to turn around and fake it

Lou Reed,"And the actresses relate
To the actor who comes home late
After the plays have gone down
And the crowds have scattered around
Though the city lights and the streets
No ticket could be beat
For the beautiful show of shows
Ah, broadway only knows
The great white milky way
It had something to say
When he fell down on his knees
After soaring through the air
With nothing to hold him there
It was really not so cute
To play without a parachute
As he stood upon the ledge
Looking out, he thought he saw a brook

And he hollered, look, there are the bells
And he sang out, here come the bells
Here come the bells, here come the bells
Here come the bells

You believe in or not, that I wanted to play football for the coach
And all those older guys
They said that he was mean and cruel but you know
I wanted to play football, for the coach
They said I was a  little too lightweight to play lineback and so I'm playing right-end
Wanted to play football for the coach
'Cause, you know some day, man you gotta stand up straight unless you're gonna fall
Then you're going to die
And the straightest dude I ever knew was standing right for me, all the time
So I had to play football for the coach

And you're getting to think about
All the things that you done

And you're getting to hate 
Just about everything

Who loved you even though she knew you was wrong
And right now she just might come shining through
And the

Glory of love

And all your two-bit friends have gone and ripped you off
They're talking behind your back saying ""man, you are never going to be no human being""
And you start thinking again about all those things that you've done
And who it was and what it was
And all the different things that made every different scene

Ah, but remember that the city is a funny place
Something like a circus or a sewer

My heart almost stopped hardly there at all

Gimme a short beer, one for you too
And a toast to everything that doesn't move

That you knew it was your last shot
When you quit, you quit, but you always wish
That you knew it was your last shot

Whiskey, bourbon, vodka and scotch
I don't care what it is you've got
I just want to know that it's my last shot
My last shot

I remember when I quit pretty good
See this here, this is where I chipped my tooth
Shot of vein in my neck and I coughed up a quaalude
On my last shot
My last shot

Here's a toast to all that's good
And here's a toast to hate
And here's a toast to toasting and I'm not boasting
When I say I'm getting straight

Lou Reed,"I was sittin' home on the west end
Watchin' cable tv with a female friend
We were watchin' the news, the world's in a mess
The poor and the hungry, a world in distress
Herpes, aids, the middle east at full throttle
Better check that sausage, before you put it in the waffle
And while you're at it, check what's in the batter
Make sure that candy's in the original wrapper

Hey, pitcher, better check that batter
Make sure that candy's in the original wrapper

Reagan says abortion's murder
While he's looking at cardinal o'connor
Look at jerry falwell louis farrakhan
Both talk religion and the brotherhood of man
They both sound like they belong in teheran
Watch out, they're goin' full throttle
Better check that sausage, before you stick it in the waffle
And while you're at it better check, what's in the batter
Make sure that candy's in the original wrapper

Hey, pitcher, better check that batter
Make sure that candy's in the original wrapper

White against white, black against jew
It seems like it's 1942
The baby sits in front of mtv
Watching violent fantasies
While dad guzzles beer with his favorite sport
Only to find his heroes are all coked up
Classic, original, the same old story
The politics of hate in a new surrounding
Hate if it's good and hate if it's bad
And if this all don't make you mad
I'll keep yours and I'll keep mine
Nothing sacred and nothing divine
Father, bless me, we're at full throttle
Better check that sausage, before you put it in the waffle
And while you're at it better check that batter

Hey, pitcher, better check that batter
Make sure that candy's in the original wrapper, hey, hey

I was born in the united states
And I grew up hard but I grew up straight
I saw a lack of morals and a lack of concern
A feeling that there's nowhere to turn
Yippies, hippies and upwardly mobile yuppies
Don't treat me like I'm some dumb lackey
'cause the murderer lives while the victims die
I'd much rather see it an eye for an eye
A heart for a heart, a brain for a brain
And if this all makes you feel a little insane
Kick up your heels, turn the music up loud
Pick up your guitar and look out at the crowd, and say, -
- ""don't mean to come on sanctimonious
But life's got me nervous and little pugnacious
Lugubrious so I give a salutation
And rock on out to beat really stupid
Ohh, poop, ah, doo and how do you do
Hip hop gonna bop till I drop.""
Watch out world, comin' at you full throttle
Better check that sausage, before you put it in the waffle
And while you're at it better check that batter
Make sure the candy's in the original wrapper

Lou Reed,"I was staring through a telescope at night
At a large light in the sky
Its spinning lights reminded me of you
A star spinning in orbit
Lighting up the sky
Or maybe it was not a star at all

I was standing by the hudson river's edge at night
Looking out across the Jersey shore
At a neon light spelling out some cola's name
And I thought your name should be dancing
Beamed from satellites
Larger than any billboard in Time's Square

Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid
I'm the one who loves you in each and every way
Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid
N.Y.C. lovers
Tell it to your heart
(Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid
Tell it to your heart)
(Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid
Tell it to your heart)

I'm on the roof, it's 5 a.m.
I guess I couldn't sleep
And I see this spinning light that I saw last week
Maybe I should wake you up
But by then it might be gone
You never know what you see when if you look up in the sky

I ran outside down a darkened street
Listening to my boot heels click
My leather jacket squeaked I needed a cigarette
When I turned the corner
My spinning light was in the street
They were filming a commercial on T.V.

Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid
We're no teenage movie that ends in tragedy
Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid

Then you better hit the door
But I know, it's just a temporary thing

On his lips, her smell, her taste
Black hair framing her perfect face
With her wonderful mind and her incredible grace

And so, he woke, he woke her with a start
To offer her his heart
For once and for all, forever to keep
And the words, that she first heard him speak
Were really very sweet
He was asking her to marry him, and to

Think it over
Baby, think it over
Think it over
Baby, why don't you think it over

She said, ""Somewhere, there's a faraway place
Where all is ordered and all is grace
No one there is ever disgraced
And everyone there is wise
And everyone has taste,""

And then she sighed, well La Dee Dah Dee Dah

Crying more, more, more
But the coal black sea waits forever

The tornados come up the coast; they run
Hurricanes rip the sky forever
Though the weathers change
The sea remains the same
The coal black sea waits forever

There are ashes split through collective guilt
People rest at sea forever
Since they burnt you up
Collect you in a cup
For you the coal black sea has no terror

Will your ashes float like some foreign boat
Or will they sink absorbed forever?
Will the Atlantic coast
Have its final boast?

If I close my eyes, I can smell your perfume; you look and say: ""hi, baby.""
If I close my eyes, pictures from China still hang from the wall
I hear the dog bark; I turned and say: ""what were you saying?""
I pictured you in the red chair inside the pale room

You sat in your chair with a tube in your arm; you were so skinny
You were still making jokes; I don't know what drugs they had you on
You said: ""I guess this is not the time for long term investments.""
You were always laughing, but you never laughed at me

They say in the end the pain was so bad that you were screaming
Now, you were no saint, but you deserved better than that
From the corner I watch them moving things from your apartment
But I can picture your red chair and pale room inside my head

If I close my eyes, I see your face, and I'm not without you
If I try hard and concentrate, I can hear your voice saying:

And now I can't see you
You had your ashes scattered at sea
There's no grave to visit, no tombstone to look at
You were in the New York Times obituary
There's no record, no tape, no book, no movie
Some photographs and some memories
Sometimes I dial your phone number by mistake
And this is what I hear:
This is no longer a working number, baby
Please redial your call
This is no longer a working number
Your party doesn't live here anymore
This is no longer a working number

Stay on the line, and an operator
Will try to bail you out

I knew I shouldn't have left
But you sounded so good, your spirits so up
I thought I'd see you next week
I say over and over if I had half a brain
If I had half a brain in my head
I wouldn't sit here, dialing a wrong number
And listening to what some recording said
I knew I should have written, written things down
I always say I'll never forget
Who can forget a one-eyed pilot?
Who's a concert pianist?
A painter, a poet, songwriter supreme
My friends are blending in my head
They're melting into one great spirit
And that spirit isn't dead
Now, I may not remember everything that you said
But I remember all the sings you've done
And not a day goes by, not an hour
When I don't try to be like you

Lou Reed,"Looking in the mirror, Harry didn't like what he saw
The cheeks of his mother, the eyes of his father
As each day crashed around him, the future stood revealed
He was turning into his parents
The final disappointment

Stepping out of the shower, Harry stared at himself
His hairline receding, the slight overbite
He picked up the razor to begin his shaving
And thought: ""oh, I wish I was different.""

I wish I was stronger; I wish I was thinner
I wish I didn't have this nose
These ears that stick out remind me of my father
And I don't want to be reminded at all

Harry looked into the mirror, thinking of Vincent Van Gogh
And with a quick swipe lopped off his nose
And happy with that he made a slice where his chin was
He's always wanted a dimple
The end of all illusion
Then peering down straight between his legs
Harry thought of the range of possibilities
A new face, a new life, no memories of the past
And slit his throat from ear to ear

Harry woke up with a cough; the stitches made his wince
A doctor smiled at him from somewhere across the room
Son, we saved your life, but you'll never look the same
And when he heard that, Harry had to laugh
Although it hurt, Harry had to laugh

You pass through humble
You pass through a maze of self doubt
When you pass through humble

You pass through arrogance, you pass through hurt
You pass through an ever-present past
And it's best not to wait for luck to save you

And as the smoke clears
There's an all-consuming fire
Lying straight ahead

But you want to in your head
But you can't be Joyce
So what is left instead?
You're stuck with yourself
And a rage that can hurt you
You have to start at the beginning again
And just this moment
This wonderful fire started up again
When you pass through humble
When you pass through sickly
When you pass through
I'm better than you all
When you pass through
Anger and self deprecation
And have the strength to acknowledge it all
When the past makes you laugh
And you can savor the magic
That let you survive your own war
You find that that fire is passion
And there's a door up ahead; not a wall
As you pass through fire, as you pass through fire
Trying to remember its name
When you pass through fire, licking at your lips
You cannot remain the same
And if the building's burning
Move towards that door
But don't put the flames out

And then some loss to even things out",Magic and Loss

with a bravery few men know

I saw isotopes introduced into his lungs
trying to stop the cancerous spread
And it made me think of ""Leda And The Swan""
and gold being made from lead

The same power that burned Hiroshima
causing three legged babies and death
Shrunk to the size of a nickel
to help him regain his breath

And though I could crush you like a bug
It will never cross my mind
It wouldn't cross my mind to your neck
Or rip out your vicious tongue
It wouldn't cross my mind to snap your leg like a twig
Or squash you like some slug

But she'd come down after some wine
Which is what happens most of the time
Then we sat and both spoke in rhymes
Till we spoke of Loraine, ah, always back to Lorraine

I was talking to Ed who'd been reported dead by mutual friends
He thought it was funny that I had no money to spend on him
So we both shared a piece of sweet cheese
And sang of our lives and our dreams
And how things can come apart at the seams
And we talk of Lorraine, always back to Lorraine

She's a wild child, oh, and nobody can get at her
She's a wild child, oh, and nobody can get to her

Sleepin' out on the street, oh, livin' all alone
Without a house or a home and then she asked you, please,
Oh, baby, can I have some spare change
Now can I break your heart?""

Me, honey, I'm in a rock n' roll band.
Ridin' in a Stutz Bearcat, Jim,
Those were different times.
They studied rows of verse,
And all the ladies rolled their eyes

Sweet Jane, sweet Jane, sweet Jane

Jack, he is a banker,
Jane, she is a clerk.
And the both of them are saving up their money
Then they come home from worka.
Sittin' by the fire
Radio just played a little classical music for you kids,
The march of the wooden soldiers
And you can hear Jack say

Sweet Jane, sweet Jane, sweet Jane

Some people like to go out dancing
And other people, (like us) they gotta work
And there's always some evil mothers
They'll tell you that life is just made out of dirt.
And the women never really faint,
Oh the villains always blink their eyes.
And the children are the only ones who blush.
And life is just to die.
But, anyone who has a heart
Wouldn't want to turn around and break it
And anyone who ever played the part
He wouldn't want to turn around and fake it

Lou Reed,"You're an adventurer
You sail across the oceans
You climb the Himalayas
Seeking truth and beauty as a natural state
You're a queen reborn
Worshiped from above, afar
Some see you as an elixir
An elemental natural, seeking perfect grace
In a catacomb
Or cave of endless drawings
Prehistoric or religious
Your accomplishments prodigious
Seeking out the perfect tone
Your language so clear
Your voice perfectly turning
As in the city, I sit yearning
Blowing rings of smoke from thin cigars
Or driving fast in foreign cars
To capture your remains
You're an adventurer
A turban wet, wrapped 'round your head
On the mountainside, they predict your death
Oh, how you fooled them all
But subjects are a poor excuse
When what you really want's a muse
An inspirating knowledge of what comes before
Speeds of light
The momentary flicker of a candle in its wicker basket
Smoking wax - facts!
Did you find that superior knowledge that eluded you in college?
Did you find that super vortex that could cause your cerebral cortex
To lose its grip?
You're an adventurer
You were out looking for meaning
While the rest of us were steaming in an inspirating urban pit
An adventurer
You enter as I'm dreaming
I wish I'd never wake up
Differentiating, scheming from my one true love
You're an adventurer
You love the angles and the cherries
The height and width of levies
The natural bridge and tunnels of the human race
You're an adventurer
Nothing seems to scare you, and if it does, it won't dissuade you
You just will not think about it
You dismiss it and defocus
You redefine the locus of your time in space - race!
As you move further from me, and though I understand the thinking
And have often done the sane thing, I find parts of me gone
You're an adventurer
And though I'll surely miss you
And of course I'll survive without you and maybe good will come of that
But at this point I anticipate some grieving
And although I know your leaving
Is a necessary adjunct to what we both do

Splitting up the once was
Splitting up the essence
Of our star-crossed fate

Lou Reed,"Wind blows snow outside my windows
Crowd below runs wild in the streets
Two rented brothers race down two separate alleys
Heading for the finish line

Down in the train yard out by the stockyard
Butchers with aprons hack meat in the snow
Blood has the brothers pulsing with envy
Heading for the finish line

Two rented brothers. Their faces keep changing
Just like these feelings I have for you
And nothing's forever not even five minutes
When you're headed for the finish line

Down in the depot out by the meat rack
Down by the tunnels surrounding the jail
Prisoners are marching in squares and in circles
They're heading for the finish line

They're lining up for Noah's Ark
They're stabbing each other in the dark
Saluting a flag made of some rich guy's socks
Heading for the finish line

Close to the line the ice is cracking
Two rented feelings sitting in the stands
Two mothers, two fathers and both of them are paid for
All of a sudden it comes back to me

Just up ahead is the finish line
Two rented referees and two checkered rags
Out of the corner of my eye comes a
Dark horse with black wings
Headed for the finish line

I'm five years old the room is fuzzy
I think there's also a very young girl
It's hard to remember what happened exactly
As I'm staring at the finish line
First came fire then came light
Then came feeling then cane sight

Lou Reed,"When your imagination has too much to say
When the chill of the night meets the sweat of the day
And you have trouble understanding what other people have to say
You'd better

When a demagogue inside your head has taken charge
And by default what you say or do is criticized
And this litany of failures is recited a thousand times
You'd better

Hang on to your emotions 

Could it be you've never felt like that
That your mind's a cage - inside the cage a cat
That spits and scratches all it can get at
And that's you
And your emotions
Could it be you've never felt like that

Rabidly trying to get it

And your emotions
You and your emotions

When your imagination has too much to say
When that facile voice inside your head says give your life away
You might think to ask - how it got that way
What books it has read - that make it that way
And where it got the right - to speak to anyone that way
You'd better

Hold on to your emotions

As I became someone else

He actually was murdered I had taken him apart
But when I put him back together
I couldn't find his heart
It was resting underneath a chair
In a bed of bright tin foil
If I pulled back the flaps
I could still see it beat
I could still hear his voice uncoil

As I said :

And I want to make her my wife

How could I think that it was true

And that idiot then becomes you
How could I believe in a movie
How could I believe in a book

Don't you think you might give me a chance
Get it on with me
Go down-town for some loving romance

I ain't worth but a thin dime

I'm sure that I could change your mind

Yeah, I want to boogie with you

There's something, baby, on which your parents
Both agree
And that is that they both have a
Deep distrust for me
And your best friend Frankie
Well, I know, your best friend Frankie, he wants to see me sink
And I don't much blame him for that
He gets so useless after so few drinks, you know, baby

I want to boogie with you

Well, I know your little baby sister
She thinks that I'm a flop
Well, I guess that you know that it's true
I spent more time at the bottom than the top
Tell your little sister
I know she wants to give me a whirl
But I don't have the time, baby
To wait till she's grown up, and she's a woman, not a girl

Lou Reed,"Take me for what I am  a star newly emerging
Long simmering explodes  inside the self is reeling
In the pocket of the heart, in the rushing of the blood
In the muscle of my sex, in the mindful mindless love
I accept the new found man and set the twilight reeling

At 5 am the moon and the sun  sit set before my window
Light glances off the blue glass we set  right before the window
And you who accept  in your soul and your head
What was misunderstood  what was thought of with dread
A new self is born  the other self dead
I accept the new found man and set the twilight reeling

A soul singer stands on the stage  the spotlight shows him sweating
He sinks to one knee  Seems to cry  the horn are unrelenting
But as the drums beats he finds himself growing hard
In the microphone's face he sees her face growing large
And the swelling crescendo no longer retards
I accept the new found man and set the twilight reeling

As the twilight sunburst gleams
As the chromium moon it sets
As I lose all my regrets and set the twilight reeling
I accept the new found man and set the twilight reeling
",Set the Twilight Reeling
Lou Reed,"When I think of you baton rouge
I think of a mariachi band
I think of sixteen and a crisp green football field
I think of a girl I never had

When I think of you baton rouge
I think of a back seat in a car
Windows are foggy and so are we
As the police asked for our i.d.

So helpless
So helpless

Ooohhh, ooohhh, so helpless
Ooohhh, so helpless
Ooohhh, so helpless
So helpless

Well I once had a car lost it in a divorce
The judge was a woman of course
She said give her the car and the house and your taste
Or else I set the trial date

So now when I think of you baton rouge
And the deep southern belles with their touch
I wonder where love ends and hate starts to blush
In the fields in the swamps in the rush

In the terra-cotta cobwebs of your mind
When did you start seeing me as a spider spinning web
Of malicious intent and you as poor, poor me
At the fire at the joint, this disinterred and broken mount
In the bedroom in the house where we were unmarried

So helpless, so helpless
So helpless
So helpless, so helpless
So helpless

When was I the villain in your heart
Putting the brake on your start
You slapped my face and cried and screamed
That's what marriage came to mean
The bitterest ending of a dream

You wanted children and I did not
Was that what it was all about
You might get a laugh when you hear me shout
You might get a laugh when you hear me shout
I wish I had


So helpless, so helpless
So helpless
So helpless, so helpless
So helpless

Sometimes when I think of baton rouge
I see us with two and a half strapping sons
One and a half flushed daughters preparing to marry
And two fat grandsons I can barely carry

Daddy, uncle, family gathered there for grace
A dog in a barbecue pit goes up in space
The dream recedes in the morning with a bad aftertaste
And I'm back in the big city worn from the race of the chase
What a waste

So thanks for the card the announcement of child
And I must say you and sam look great
Your daughter's gleaming in that -
- white wedding dress with pride
Sad to say I could never bring that to you that wide smile

So I try not to think of baton rouge
Or of a, of a, of a mariachi band
Or of sixteen and a crisp green football field
And the girl, and the girl I never had

So helpless, so helpless
So helpless
So helpless, so helpless
So helpless

A piece of duct tape down my back
Love pierced the arrow with the twelve
And I can't get you back

Across the streets an old ford, they took off it's wheels
The engine is gone
In it's seat sits a box
With a note that says, goodbye charlie, thanks a lot

I see a child through a window with a bib
And I think of us and what we almost did
The Hudson rocketing with light
The ships pass the statue of liberty at night

They call it ecstasy, ah
Ecstasy
Ecstasy, ah
Ecstasy

Some men call me st. ivory
Some call me St. Maurice
I'm smooth as alabaster
With white veins runnin' through my cheeks

A big stud through my eyebrow
A scar on my arm that says, domain
I put it over the tattoo
That contained your name

They called you ecstasy, ecstasy

They call you ecstasy, ecstasy

The moon passing through a cloud
A body facing up is floating towards a crowd
And I think of a time and what I couldn't do
I couldn't hold you close, I couldn't, I couldn't become you

They call you ecstasy, I can't hold you down
I can't hold you up
I feel like that car that I saw today, no radio
No engine, no hood

I'm going to the cafe, I hope they've got music
And I hope that they can play
But if we have to part
I'll have a new scar right over my heart
I'll call it ecstasy

Split like a cord of wood my family broke up
Sold like a piece of steer, a piece of meat, a cow
A breathing piece of shit

Called for I was tall, I was big, I could hold up
A tree or a piece of steel I could do
What my fat owner can't

I'm always watching the way his wife looks me over
I have a sex twice as big as her husband's
If I wasn't so large, so strong, so pale
I'd disappear under a bush
Colorless men and ladies of the world unite
Kill your master with one cut of your knife
Kill them during sex, kill them during talk
Kill them whenever you can

My father was dark, my mother was light
Look at me, I'm strong

look at me, look at this smile

Things are all right, don't worry about this
my mind's amiss, I've lost the kiss

My smile is leaden, my gait is rubber
and I say as one possum to another like a possum

is another possum in this tree
playing possum

And maybe I should be Edinburgh
In a kilt in Edinburgh
Doin' a modern dance

Or maybe I should get a farm in Southern France
Where the winds are wispy and the villagers dance
And you and I we'd sleep beneath a moon
Moon in June and sleep till noon
And maybe you and I could fall in love
Regain the spirit that we once had
You'd let me hold you and touch the night
That shines so bright, so bright with fright

With their place in the human race
Maybe I'm not cut out for city life
The smell of exhaust, the smell of strife
And maybe you don't want to be a wife
It's not a life being a wife

Doin' a modern dance
So maybe I should go to Tanganyika
Where the rivers run, down mountains tall and steep
Or go to India to study chants
And lose romance to a mantra's dance
I need a guru, I need some law
Explain to me the things we saw
Why it always comes to this
It's all downhill after the first kiss
Maybe I should move to Rotterdam
Maybe move to Amsterdam
I should move to Ireland, Italy, Spain
Afghanistan where there is no rain
Or maybe I should just learn a modern dance
Where roles are shifting the modern dance
You never touch you don't know who you're with
This week, this month, this time of year
This week, this month, this time of year
Doin' a modern dance
You don't know who you're with modern dance
I should move to Pakistan, go to Afghanistan

Lou Reed,"Paralyzed by hatred and a piss ugly soul
If he murdered his father, he thought he'd become whole
While listening at night to an old radio
Where they danced to the rock minuet

In the gay bars in the back of the bar
He consummated hatred on a cold sawdust floor
While the jukebox played backbeats, he sniffed coke off a jar
While they danced to a rock minuet

School was a waste, he was meant for the street
But school was the only way, the army could be beat
The two whores sucked his nipples 'til he came on their feet
As they danced to the rock minuet

He dreamt that his father was sunk to his knees
His leather belt tied so tight that it was hard to breathe
And the studs from his jacket were as cold as a breeze
As he danced to a rock minuet

He pictured the bedroom where he heard the first cry
His mother on all fours, ah, with his father behind
And her yell hurt so much, he had wished he'd gone blind
And rocked to a rock minuet

In the back of the warehouse were a couple of guys
They had tied someone up and sewn up their eyes
And he got so excited he came on his thighs
When they danced to the rock minuet

On avenue be, someone cruised him one night
He took him in an alley and then pulled a knife
And thought of his father, as he cut his windpipe
And finally danced to the rock minuet

In the curse of the alley, the thrill of the street
On the bitter cold docks where the outlaws all meet
In euphoria drug in euphoria heat
You could dance to the rock minuet

In the thrill of the needle and anonymous sex
You could dance to the rock minuet

So when you dance hard, slow dancing
When you dance hard, slow dancing
When you dance hard, slow dancing
When you dance to the rock minuet

That nothing of it matters

Forever in his place
I'm the indentured servant
Forever in his place

I wish I built a cabinet
Of shiny bolts and wood
Secret draws and hiding places
Sculpted out of wood
Secret places, secret lies
In a desk lying alone

A secret letter written to you
To be read when you're alone
A secret letter written to you
To be read when you're alone

It says I'm your indentured servant
I can no longer pretend
That I'm a lover or an equal
I'm not even a friend
I'm not good enough to serve you
I'm not good enough to stay

So it is that I beseech you
To please turn me away
So it is that I beseech you
To please turn me away

Turn me away
Turn me away
Turn me away

I'm asking you to let me go
It hurts me when you're sad
And I can not do better than this
Which must surely make you mad
I'd be better off in your cabinet
Or in a prison made of cloth

Crouched beneath your dress I come
Shooting little spurts
Crouched beneath your dress I come
Shooting little spurts

I'm your indentured servant
But even I have pride
In what I make or say or do
Although I've lots to hide
I hide from freedom and I hide from you
'cause you've found me out

I belong in prison beneath your legs
In a cabinet that I've built
Beneath a candle in a secret drawer
In a prison by a moat

I'm your indentured servant
And I'm asking you to leave
Me outside this prison cell
Where only you can breathe
I'm your indentured servant
But I'm asking you for this

Please release me from this love
And do it with a kiss
I'm your indentured servant
I'm the one you'll miss

Do it with a kiss
Do it with a kiss
Do it with a kiss
I'm the one you'll miss",White Prism
Lou Reed,"In Berlin, by the wall

Lou Reed,"When you pass through the fire, you pass through humble
you pass through a maze of self doubt
When you pass through humble, the lights can blind you
some people never figure that out

You pass through arrogance, you pass through hurt
you pass through an ever present past
And it's best not to wait for luck to save you
pass through the fire to the light

Pass through the fire to the light
pass through the fire to the light
It's best not to wait for luck to save you
pass through the fire to the light

As you pass through the fire, your right hand waving
there are things you have to throw out
That caustic dread inside your head
will never help you out

You have to be very strong, 'cause you'll start from zero
over and over again
And as the smoke clears there's an all consuming fire
lying straight ahead

Lying straight ahead
lying straight ahead
As the smoke clears there's an all consuming fire
lying straight ahead

They say no one person can do it all
but you want to in your head
But you can't be Shakespeare and you can't be Joyce
so what is left instead

You're stuck with yourself and a rage that can hurt you
you have to start at the beginning again
And just this moment this wonderful fire
started up again

When you pass through humble, when you pass through sickly
when you pass through I'm better than you all
When you pass through anger and self deprecation
and have the strength to acknowledge it all

When the past makes you laugh and you can savor the magic
that let you survive your own war
You find that that fire is passion
and there's a door up ahead not a wall

As you pass through fire as you pass through fire
trying to remember its name
When you pass through fire licking at your lips
you cannot remain the same

And if the building's burning move towards that door
but don't put the flames out
There's a bit of magic in everything
and then some loss to even things out

Some loss to even things out
some loss to even things out
There's a bit of magic in everything
and then some loss to even things out
",Magic and Loss - The Summation
Lou Reed,"Sometimes I wonder who am I
The world seeming to pass me by
A younger man now getting old
I have to wonder what the rest of life will hold

I hold a mirror to my face
There are some lines that I could trace
To memories of loving you
A passion that breaks reason in two

I, I, I have to think and I have to think and stop me now
If reminisces make you frown
One thinks of what one hoped to be
And then faces reality

I wonder who started all this
Was God in love and gave a kiss
To someone who later betrayed?
And God, less love, sent us away?

Sometimes I wonder who am I
Who made the trees, who made the sky?
Who made the storms, who made heartbreak?
I wonder how much life I can take

I see at last a future self
Were you alive, I'd ask your help
But thinking puts me in a daze
And thinking never helped me anyway

You always were so negative
You never saw the positive
You always stand upon the edge
And dream of what it must be to be dead

I know I like to dream a lot
And think of other worlds that are not
I hate that I need air to breathe
I'd like to leave this body and be free

You'd like to float like a mystic child
You'd like to kiss an angel on the brow
You'd love to solve the mystery of live
By cutting someone's throat or removing their heart

You'd like to see it beat
You'd like to hold your eyes
And though you know I'm dead
You'd like to hold my thighs

If it's wrong to think on this
To hold the dead past, to hold the dead past in your fist
Why were we, why were we given memories?
Let's lose our minds, be set free

Sometimes I wonder who am I
The world seeming to pass me by
A younger man now getting old
I have to wonder what the rest of life will hold

I wonder, I wonder who started all this, oh
Was God in love and, was God in love and gave a kiss
To someone who later betrayed?
And God less love sent us away

To someone who later betrayed
God less love sent us away
To someone who later betrayed
God less love sent us away

Lou Reed,"Once upon a midnight dreary
As I pondered, weak and weary
Over many a quaint and curious
Volume of forgotten lore
While I nodded, nearly napping
Suddenly there came a tapping
As of some one gently rapping
Rapping at my chamber door
""'Tis some visitor,"" I muttered
""Tapping at my chamber door
Only this and nothing more.""

Muttering I got up weakly
Always I've had trouble sleeping
Stumbling upright my mind racing
Furtive thoughts flowing once more
I, there hoping for some sunrise
Happiness would be a surprise
Loneliness no longer a prize
Rapping at my chamber door
Seeking out the clever bore
Lost in dreams forever more
Only this and nothing more

Hovering my pulse was racing
Stale tobacco my lips tasting
Scotch sitting upon my basin
Remnants of the night before
Came again
Infernal tapping on the door
In my mind jabbing
Is it in or outside rapping
Calling out to me once more
The fit and fury of Lenore
Nameless here forever more

And the silken sad uncertain
Rustling of the purple curtain
Thrilled me, filled me
With fantastic terrors never felt before
So that now, oh wind, stood breathing
Hoping yet to calm my breathing
""'Tis some visitor entreating
Entrance at my chamber door
Some lost visitor entreating
Entrance at my chamber door
This it is, and nothing more.""

Deep into the darkness peering
Long I stood there
Wondering fearing
Doubting dreaming fantasies
No mortal dared to dream before
But the silence was unbroken
And the stillness gave no token
And the only word there spoken
Was the whispered name, ""Lenore.""
This I thought
And out loud whispered from my lips
The foul name festered
Echoing itself
Merely this, and nothing more

Back into my chamber turning
Every nerve within me burning
When once again I heard a tapping
Somewhat louder than before
""surely,"" said I
Surely that is something at my iron staircase
Open the door to see what threat is
Open the window, free the shutters
Let us this mystery explore
Oh, bursting heart be still this once
And let this mystery explore
It is the wind and nothing more

Just one epithet I muttered as inside
I gagged and shuddered
When with manly flirt and flutter
In there flew a stately raven
Sleek and ravenous as any foe
Not the least obeisance made he
Not a minutes gesture towards me
Of recognition or politeness
But perched above my chamber door
This fowl and salivating visage
Insinuating with its knowledge
Perched above my chamber door
Silent sat and staring
Nothing more

Askance, askew
The self's sad fancy smiles at you I swear
At this savage viscous countenance it wears
Though you show here shorn and shaven
And I admit myself forlorn and craven
Ghastly grim and ancient raven
Wandering from the opiate shores
Tell me what thy lordly name is
That you are not nightmare sewage
Some dire powder drink or inhalation
Framed from flames of downtown lore
Quotes the raven, ""nevermore.""

And the raven sitting lonely
Staring sickly at my male sex only
That one word
As if his soul in that one word
He did outpour, ""pathetic.""
Nothing farther than he uttered
Not a feather then he fluttered
Till finally was I that muttered as I stared
Dully at the floor
""other friends have flown and left me
Flown as each and every hope has flown before
As you no doubt will fore the morrow.""
But the bird said, ""never, more.""

Then I felt the air grow denser
Perfumed from some unseen incense
As though accepting angelic intrusion
When in fact I felt collusion
Before the guise of false memories respite
Respite through the haze of cocaine's glory
I smoke and smoke the blue vial's glory
To forget
At once
The base Lenore
Quoth the raven, ""nevermore.""

""Prophet,"" said I, ""thing of evil
Prophet still, if bird or devil
By that heaven that bend above us
By that God we both ignore
Tell this soul with sorrow laden
Willful and destructive intent
How had lapsed a pure heart lady
To the greediest of needs
Sweaty arrogant dickless liar
Who ascribed to nothing higher
Than a jab from prick to needle
Straight to betrayal and disgrace
The conscience showing not a trace.""
Quoth the raven, ""nevermore.""

""Be that word our sign of parting
Bird or fiend,"" I yelled upstarting
""get thee back into the tempest
Into the smoke filled bottle's shore
Leave no black plume as a token
Of the slime thy soul hath spoken
Leave my loneliness unbroken
Quit as those have quit before
Take the talon from my heart
And see that I can care no more
Whatever mattered came before
I vanish with the dead Lenore.""
Quoth the raven, ""nevermore.""

But the raven, never flitting
Still is sitting silent sitting
Above a painting silent painting
Of the forever silenced whore
And his eyes have all the seeming
Of a demon's that is dreaming
And the lamplight over him
Streaming throws his shadow to the floor
I love she who hates me more
I love she who hates me more
And my soul shall not be lifted from that shadow
Nevermore",The Raven

Businessman king is of the lowest order
His advisors
Crumbling mockeries of education driven by avarice
My love
Dress them in the suits of mockery
And in their advanced state of stupidity
And senility
Burn and destroy them so their ashes might join the compost
Which they so much deserve
If justice on this earth be fleeting
Let us for once hear the weeping
And the braying of the businessman king
Let them be the the orangutans they are
And set them blazing from the chandelier for all to see
Hanging from the ceiling by their ridiculous chains
And petticoats which you will have them wear
Under the guise of costumic buffoonery
He who underestimates
In time is bound to find the truth sublime
And hollow lie upon the grates of systemic disorder

Lou Reed,"Far away far away
Are not all lovely things far away
As far at least lies that valley
As the bedridden sun in the luminous east
The paralyzed mountains, the sickly river
Are not all things lovely far away
Are not all things lovely far away

It is a valley where time is not interrupted
Where its history shall not be interpreted
Stories of Satan's dart of angel wings
Unhappy things
Within the valley of unrest

The sun ray dripped all red
The dell was silent
All the people having gone to war
Leaving no interrogator to mind
The willful looting the pale past knowledge
The sly mysterious stars
The unguarded flowers leaning
The tulips overhead paler
The terror stricken sky
Rolling like a waterfall
Over the horizon's fiery wall
A visage full of meaning

How the unhappy shall confess
As Roderick watches like a human eye
While violets and lilies wave
Like banners in the sky
Hovering over and above a grave
As dew drops on the freshly planted eternal dew
Coming down in gems
There's no use to pretend
Though gorgeous clouds fly
Roderick, like the human eye has closed forever
Far away far away

Roderick, whatever thy image may be
Roderick, no magic shall sever the music from thee
Thou hast bound many eyes in a dreamy sleep
Oh tortured day
The strains still arrive
I hear the bells
I have kept my vigilance
Rain dancing in the rhythm of a shower
Over what guilty spirit to not hear the beating
To not hear the beating heart
But only tears of perfect moan
Only tears of perfect moan",The Valley of Unrest
Lou Reed,"It must be nice to disappear 
To have a vanishing act
To always be looking forward
And never looking back 

How nice it is to disappear
Float into a mist
With a young lady on your arm
Looking for a kiss 

It might be nice to disappear
To have a vanishing act
To always be looking forward
Never look over your back 

It must be nice to disappear
Float into a mist
With a young lady on your arm
Looking for a kiss
I want to Know (Pit and Pendulum)
Young Poe 

Young Poe: 

Under the intense scrutiny of Ligeia's eyes I have felt the full knowledge and force of their expression and yet been unable to possess it and have felt it leave me as so many other things have left, the letter half read the bottle half drunk finding in the commonest objects of the universe a circle of analogies, of metaphors for that expression which has been willfully withheld from me, the access to the inner soul denied. 

Judges (Choir): I want to know 

Young Poe:

In consideration of the faculties and impulses of the human soul in consideration of our arrogance our radical, primitive irreducible arrogance of reason we have all overlooked the propensity. We saw no need for it, the paradoxical something which we may call perverseness. Through its promptings we act without comprehensible object.

We act for the reason we should not. For certain minds this is absolutely irresistible. The conviction of the wrong or impolicy of an action is often the unconquerable force. It is a primitive impulse. The overwhelming tendency to do wrong for the wrong's sake. We persist in acts because we feel that we should not persist in them.

Judges and the dead people (Choir): I want to know",Vanishing Act
Lou Reed,"Sometimes I wonder who am I
The world seeming to pass me by
A younger man now getting old
I have to wonder what the rest of life will hold
I hold a mirror to my face
There are some lines that I could trace
To memories of loving you
A passion that breaks reason in two
I, I, I have to think and, I have to think and stop me now
If reminisces make you frown
One thinks of what one hoped to be
And then faces reality
I wonder who started all this
Was God in love and gave a kiss
To someone who later betrayed
And God less love sent us away?
Sometimes I wonder who am I
Who made the trees,who made the sky
Who made the storms, who made heartbreak?
I wonder how much life I can take
I see at last a future self
Were you alive I'd ask your help
But thinking puts me in a daze
And thinking never helped me anyway
You always were so negative
You never saw the positive
You always stand upon the edge
And dream of what it must be to be dead
I know I like to dream a lot
And think of other worlds that are not
I hate that I need air to breathe
I'd like to leave this body - and be free
You'd like to float like a mystic child
You'd like to kiss an angel on the brow
You'd love to solve the mystery of live
By cutting someone's throat or removing their heart
You'd like to see it beat
You'd like to hold your eyes
And though you know I'm dead
You'd like to hold my thighs
If it's wrong to think on this
To hold the dead past, to hold the dead past in your fist
Why were we, why were we given memories?
Let's lose our minds
Be set free!
Sometimes I wonder who am I
The world seeming to pass me by
A younger man now getting old
I have to wonder what the rest of life will hold
I wonder
I wonder who started all this - ooh
Was God in love and gave a kiss
To someone who later betrayed
And God less love sent us away
To someone who later betrayed
God less love sent us away
To someone who later betrayed
God less love sent us away",Who Am I? (Tripitena's Song)
Lou Reed,"And what costume shall the poor girl wear
To all tomorrow's parties
A hand-me-down dress from who knows where
To all tomorrow's parties
And where will she go, and what shall she do
When midnight comes around
She'll turn once more to Sunday's clown and cry behind the door

And what costume shall the poor girl wear
To all tomorrow's parties
Why silks and linens of yesterday's gowns
To all tomorrow's parties
And what will she do with Thursday's rags
When Monday comes around
She'll turn once more to Sunday's clown and cry behind the door

And what costume shall the poor girl wear
To all tomorrow's parties
For Thursday's child is Sunday's clown
For whom none will go mourning

Of rags and silks, a costume

Lou Reed,"They tied his arms behind his back
To teach him how to swim
They put blood in his coffee
And milk in his gin
They stood over the soldier
In the midst of the squalor
There was war in his body
And it caused his brain to holler

Make the sacrifice
Mutilate my face
If you need someone to kill
I'm a man without a will
Wash the razor in the rain
Let me luxuriate in pain
Please don't set me free
Death means a lot to me

The pain was lean and it made him scream
He knew he was alive
He put a pin through the nipples on his chest
He thought he was a saint
I've made love to my mother, killed my father and brother
What am I to do
When a sin goes too far, it's like a runaway car
It cannot be controlled

Spit upon his face and scream
There's no oedipus today
This is no play you're thinking you are in
What will you say
Take the blue mask down from my face
And look me in the eye
I get a thrill from punishment
I've always been that way

I loathe and despise repentance
You are permanently stained
Your weakness buys indifference
And indiscretion in the streets
Dirty's what you are and clean is what you're not
You deserve to be soundly beat

Make the sacrifice
Take it all the way
There's no ""won't"" high enough
To stop this desperate day
Don't take death away
Cut the finger at the joint
Cut the stallion at his mount
And stuff it in his mouth",The Blue Mask [DVD]

Lou Reed,"Climbing up on Solsbury Hill
I could see the city light
Wind was blowing, time stood still
Eagle flew out of the night
He was something to observe
Came in close, I heard a voice
Standing, stretching every nerve
I had to listen had no choice
I did not believe the information
I just had to trust imagination
My heart going boom, boom, boom
Son, he said, grab your things I've come to take you home

To keep in silence I resigned
My friends would think I was a slut
Turning water into wine
Open doors would soon be shut
So I went from day to day
Though my life was in a rut
Till I thought of what I'd say
And which connection I should cut
I was feeling part of the scenery
I walked right out of the machinery
My heart going boom, boom, boom
Hey, he said, grab your things I've come to take you home 

Take back home, grab your things
When illusion spin her net
I'm never where I want to be
And liberty she pirouette?
When I think that I am free
Watched by empty silhouettes
Close their eyes but still can see
No one taught them etiquette
I will show another me
Today I don't need a replacement
I'll tell them what the smile on my face meant
My heart was going boom, boom, boom
Hey, I said, keep my things I've come to take me home
Hey, I said, keep my things I've come to take you home
I've come to take you home
Hey, I said, I've come to take you home
Come to take you home
My heart was going boom, boom, boom
My heart was going boom, boom, boom
Hey, I said, you can keep my things and come to take me home

Lou Reed,"I would cut my legs and tits off

Small town girl
Small town girl
Small town girl

I was thinking Peter Lorre
When things got pretty gory as I
Crossed to the Brandenburg Gate
I was feeling snappy perhaps I'd been napping
As I just ate
A following heart can tear you apart
On a midnight to eight shift
A graveyard romance can only give one chance
As the tombstones weave and breathe

Small town girl
Small town girl

Feeling happy when my heart got beating
On a Sunday afternoon
I dreamt of breezes going through the treeses
And stars were still illumed
I have three hearts that I keep apart
Trying to relate
To normal feelings and the nighttime reeling
And some absinthe drunk so late

Small town girl
My small town girl

The cook got drunk and all the whores they shrunk
Onto the size of dessert plates
But me I'm happy cause I got my little nappy
And some opium to set me straight
I'm just a small town girl who wants to give it a whirl
While my looks still hold me straight

Straight up to illusion and fantasy's fusion
Of reality mixed with drink
I'm just a small town girl who's gonna give life a whirl

You can't catch the moon, or the sun or the stars
It doesn't matter who you are

Now me I've tried a million tricks
To make life cold and make it stick
Not running heat that flames then out
But the proud piece of ice that always floats
Iced honey, iced honey

If I can't trap a butterfly or a bee
If I can't keep my heart where I want it to be
If no matter how much soul and heart
I put to the wood
If a flaming heart is not that good

If you can't put a butterfly in a jar
If violence mars your final hour
If you make others feel like jam
Poured on a piece of charbroiled lamb

If it's all mixed up and you cannot shout
And your oxygen starts to run out
If your final gasp has the recipe wrong
And instead of hello you say so long
If your energy starts to leak out
And people wonder what you're all about
A heartbreaker with an unattached heart
The story of love gives them all a start

And me, I've always been this way
Not by choice, just this way
I can't put my honey pot in a jar
Or a heart or a fist of some young boy

If you can't put a butterfly in a jar
No wonder no need to wonder where you are
It might seem like hell, the River Styx
Your affection never sticks

No matter what you say, no matter what you do

We were meant to be peons
We're meant to be peons
Mere mortals below
Meant to be servants
Meant to be dismissible objects one fucks with
Oh, oh, oh you're so special
No law meant for you
You come and go like the goddess you are

The fingertips run through your hair
A billowing heart beats

What a glorious feeling
To be so rejected
So rejected

An idiot's idiocy
My caring for you
You think I'm a book or a table
You can rest your fuckin' feet on
When you're able

The taste of your vulva, everything on it
The hair on your shoulders
The smell of your armpit
We do love you, to look upon your perfect body
We love you regal
We love you haughty

If I was half drowning
An arm above the last wave

Would you come to me
Would you pull me up
Would the effort really hurt you
Is it unfair to ask you
To help pull me up

The smoke effortlessly floating

Pull me up
Would you be my lord and savior
Pull me up by my hair
Now would you kiss me, on my lips

The brain that once was listening now
Shoots out its tiresome message

Won't you pull me up

Has the motor and he's driving towards
An island of lost souls

Would you pull me by the arm up

Lou Reed,"When you pass through the fire, you pass through humble
You pass through a maze of self doubt
When you pass through humble, the lights can blind you
Some people never figure that out

You pass through arrogance, you pass through hurt
You pass through an ever present past
And it's best not to wait for luck to save you
Pass through the fire to the light

Pass through the fire to the light
Pass through the fire to the light
It's best not to wait for luck to save you
Pass through the fire to the light

As you pass through the fire, your right hand waving
There are things you have to throw out
That caustic dread inside your head will never help you out
You have to be very strong 'cause you'll start from zero
over and over again
And as the smoke clears there's an all consuming fire
Lying straight ahead

Lying straight ahead
Lying straight ahead
As the smoke clears there's an all consuming fire

They say no one person can do it all
But you want to in your head
But you can't be Shakespeare and you can't be Joyce
So what is left instead

You're stuck with yourself and a rage that can hurt you
You have to start at the beginning again
And just this moment
This wonderful fire started up again

When you pass through humble, when you pass through sickly
When you pass through, I'm better than you all
When you pass through anger and self deprecation
And have the strength to acknowledge it all

When the past makes you laugh and you can savor the magic
That let you survive your own war
You find that that fire is passion
And there's a door up ahead, not a wall

As you pass through fire, as you pass through fire
Trying to remember its name
When you pass through fire licking at your lips
You cannot remain the same

And if the building's burning, move towards that door
But don't put the flames out

And then some loss to even things out

Sitting on a hard chair this moment won't wait
Listening to the speakers they're talking about you
Look at all the people all the people you knew

Sitting with my back straight it becomes hard to hear
Some people are crying it becomes hard to hear
I don't think you'd have liked it you would have made a joke
You would have made it easier you'd say ""tomorrow I'm smoke""

Trying hard to listen to your friends who have come
Some of them are famous and some are just like me

Lou Watson,"I can only give you love that lasts forever,
And the promise to be near each time you call,
And the only heart I own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all.
I can only give you country walks in springtime,
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.
If you're wond'ring what I'm asking in return, dear,
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small.
Say it's me that you'll adore for now and ever more, that's all, that's all.",That's All
Lou Watson,"I need love, love to ease my mind,
I need to find, find someone to call mine,
But mama said you can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy,
It's a game of give and take.
You can't hurry love,
No, you just have to wait,
You gotta trust, give it time,
No matter how long it takes;
But how many heartaches must I stand
Before I find a love to let me live again.
Right now the only thing that keeps me hanging on,
When I feel my strength, yeah, it's almost gone,
I remember mama said,

You can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy,
It's a game of give and take.
How long must I wait how much more can I take,
Before loneliness will 'cause my heart, heart to break?
No, I can't bear to live my life alone.
I grow impatient for a love to call my own,
But when I feel that I, I can't go on,
These precious words keeps me hanging on,
I remember mama said,

Can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy,
it's a game of give and take.

You can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy,
It's a game of give and take
No matter how long it takes.

No love, love don't come easy,
But I keep on waiting, anticipating for that
Soft voice to talk to me at night,
For some tender arms to hold me tight.
I keep waiting; I keep on waiting,
But it ain't easy, it ain't easy when mama said

You can't hurry love no,
You just have to wait,
She said trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes.

You can't hurry love
You just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take.",You Can't Hurry Love
Lou Watson,"""Romance is a game for fools""
I used to say
A game I thought I'd never play
""Romance is a game for fools""
I said and grinned
Then you passed by
And here am I
Throwing caution to the wind

Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head.
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

Mm-mm-mm-mm
Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Fools rush in where wise men never, never, never go
Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
Ah, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Just open up your heart and let this fool rush on in
Just open up your heart because I-I-I-I-I-I-I am coming in
Open up your heart and let this fool rush in!",Fools Rush In
Lou Watson,"Wash away all the lines on your face that show how you've aged it's a long way down
Your back's been broken you can't make the rounds the tables are turned as the litany goes...
You're a rotten old man who'll be covered in dirt on your knees
And pray to the maker that caused you to bleed

Turn back the hand on the clock
You're a bitter old man who's done nothing
But work your hands to the bone on the assembly lines
You've grown cold to the touch of the ones that you love
Ignorance is something you can't over come but you've passed it on down
And that's something much worse for a bitter young man...
Is now taking the torch

Silent scorn - you've taken it out on the ones you adore Inside rage
They've left you before but they'll come back again
They'll pray for you with all their love
But this time your indifference just can't be excused Forced amends
Well it's something you'll die with but it goes on for them...
For a bitter young man...has now taken the torch...",Time After Time
Lou Yeidel,"Like a bird on the wire,
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free.
Like a worm on a hook,
Like a knight from some old fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons for thee.
If I, if I have been unkind,
I hope that you can just let it go by.
If I, if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you.

Like a baby, stillborn,
Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me.
But I swear by this song
And by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee.
I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch,
He said to me, ""You must not ask for so much.""
And a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door,
She cried to me, ""Hey, why not ask for more?""

Oh like a bird on the wire,

I've become nothing but violence and passion
Between fire and ice

The love I lavish constitutes
An unthinkable experience
Made of sensual pleasure, suffering, delight
My suffering, your pleasure

I'm the haunting shadow of desire, between ecstasy and
Pain
My body's nothing but fire, madness and desire
I've become nothing but violence and passion
Between fire and ice

I'm the haunting shadow of desire, between ecstasy and
Pain
My body's nothing but fire, madness and desire
I've become nothing but violence and passion
Between fire and ice
I've become nothing but violence and passion
Between fire and ice
Between fire and ice
Between fire and ice",Fire and Ice
Loudermilk,"The sun wakes me on devil's morning 
His arms stretched over the town to make a red sky 
Month of Juliet and you are gorgeous, the dust you ingest you die 
Broke my link my ideal now their eyes 
Like their lies move on quick like a suicide 
Summer prays that she could be rain 
As the car crash left you for the blame 
And nightfall brought your daemons and evil arkaide 
She is the famine, I'm California 
He is Dakota, I'm California 
There can't be lying in California 
Left like the west, I am California 
The sunset was the devil's warning 
His siren was louder than love and it sounds so pretty relieved that you fell 
Like the leaves of a cherry tree 
Something born in my brain bleeding silver and rain lives a will that can't ever change 
And nightfall was a shock so you closed your eyes, a fever breaks out through the line 
And I'm gone 'cause I felt the curse of the sun 
You left your sweetheart in California... 
He is beautiful and a whore and he'll die with you on the floor 
Sounds like sugar into your ear and his spiderweb caught your tear 
I noticed he's writing his name in your hand 
What was your Christian name California",California
Loudness,"Crying face, cry more
Now you've bet your everything
Tired and wasted
Ah on the verge of craze

I'm on fire forever
I'm on fire forever
Oh! Oh! Oh! Come on!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Come on!

Never hard, too late to lie
Every one wishes to die once
Tired and wasted
Ah on the verge of craze",I'm on Fire
Loudness,"I can hear the footsteps
Of one who's begun to flutter his wings
Strong and heavy
Hear the scream

Dream as big as the universe
Grasp it in your palm now
Open your eyes!

This earth will one day
Become a land without life
Ugly people living on
Even my tears have dried up

We need love We need love
Woo Yeah!! Open your eyes!",Open Your Eyes
Loudness,"Woman, you are a butterfly
Dancing fire with savage grace
Man to man you freely ramble
Change your minde you change your face

Don't keep me waiting all night long
Don't keep me crying all night long
Don't take me down
Don't bring me down

Tellin' lies are what you're good for
What's this game you play?
I come close you keep your distance
I'm falling victim to your ways

Don't keep me waiting all night long
Don't keep me crying all night long
Don't take me down
Don't bring me down

Tell me if you still feel the same way for me
Tell me, if you don't love me any more
Oh no, anymore
Oh no, anymore",Butterfly

Mother! Always by your side
Your love is forever
You gave me everything

Father! Wishing I was you
Father! Good and strong as you
My love is forever
You taught me everything

They gave you everything
Your name, your place in time
Go and show the people the way to live

Go and show the people the way to live

Loudness,"Sometimes I scream, sometimes I cry
Sometimes I just lie in illusion
Some nights I shake, some nights I sweat
Some nights I'm just wet with confusion

Don't do this, don't do that
Don't look back, you might stumble
Don't say yes, don't say no
Don't let go, or your tumble down

Some days I kick, some days I bite
Some days I must fight the reaction
Sometimes I win, sometimes I lose
Sometimes I'm just bruised by the action
 
Now you have the power to destroy
Clockwork people just like clockwork toy
Don't try to tell me your fantasy
It's my life
You try to tell me what's right for me
Turn the knife, twist the key

Don't do this, don't do that
Don't look back, you might stumble
Don't say yes, don't say no
Don't let go, or your tumble down

Clockwork people just like clockwork toy
Don't try to tell me your fantasy

Get away, I'm telling you
Watch what you say
On the danger way
Get away, let's shake it
Get away, let's break it

Without hot wheels, you'd be lost
Without chain link, you'd be lost
Without cold steel, you'd be lost

Save yourself, save your lover

Get away, disaster

And Blinded By The Light
Caught Up In A Maze
Now I Feel Just Like A Wolf
Who Forgot How To Fight
And Frozen By The Haze

I Was A Hungry Mean Beast
I Would Never Be Satisfeid
Always Looking For The Next Feast
Waiting For The Next Ride

Like Hell, I'm Gonna Do It. Like Hell
Like Hell, I'm Gonna Rock You , Like Hell
Like Hell, I'm Comin' At You, Like Hell
Like Hell, I'm Gonna Shock You, Like Hell

Just One More Sip To Ease My Thirst
Another For The Fire
That's All That I Need
The Time Has Come To Break The Spell
Or Give In To Desire
There Ain't No In Between


No I Won't Stay And Take It
Get Caught Up Standing Still
Looking For A Way To Shake It
Looking For The Kill

[Chorus]

No More Hiding In The Shadows
Runnin' From The Fight
No More Cryin' When The Wind Blows

Howling At The Night
