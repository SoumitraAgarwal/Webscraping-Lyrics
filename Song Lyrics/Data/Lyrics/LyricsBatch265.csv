On the grind

No time, always runnin' here and there
Chasin' the money
So much jibber-jabber's cloggin' up our soul

Where are we runnin' now?

Lenny Kravitz,"When I was just a boy
My daddy sat me on his knee
He told me that he loved
Me and that we're a family
He spoke about the world
And all the possibilities
Then he held me in his arms
And said be what you want to be

He paved the way for me to follow
Uncharted terrain now had a name
It's how I got over

When I became a man
My daddy said come walk with me
He said beeing a man
Comes with responsibility
And all is keep your word
To the best of your ability
Then he looked me in my eyes
And said it's time to set you free

He paved the way for me to follow
Uncharted terrain now had a name
It's how I got over

He paved the way for me to follow
Uncharted terrain now had a name
It's how I got over

He paved the way for me to follow
Uncharted terrain now had a name
It's how I got over",Uncharted Terrain [Non-Album B-Side]
Lenny Kravitz,"We are like pirates and we are comin' with the biggest ego
We're gonna bring it down and give it to you, that's how we go
We're gonna drop from the sky like a killer tornado

[Chorus]
Here we are again my friends
We're back in Vietnam
Back in Vietnam
We're back in Vietnam
Back in Vietnam

We're gonna keep on riding `til the enemy's been severed
Well never turn around, we don't care if it takes forever
Men women children will die we're all in this together

[Chorus]

do do do do do
do do do do do
do do do do do
do do do do do

[Chorus]

We're gonna fly over the world inside a giant eagle
We do just what we want and don't care if it isn't legal
We're on a horse that is high, we think We're so damn regal

Here we are again my friend
We're back in Vietnam
Back in Vietnam...oh yeah
We're back in Vietnam (back in Vietnam)
Back in Vietnam (make no mistake about it)

Lenny Kravitz,"I'm gonna walk my faith
Gonna raise my song
I'm gonna fight my battle
Gonna praise my Lord

[Chorus]
It's getting heavy
But I'm ready
To take on this world and rock steady
So come on, bring it on

I'm gonna face my demons
Gonna turn them down
I'm gonna keep on moving
Gonna make my sound

[Chorus]

Bring it on [11x]",Bring It On
Lenny Kravitz,"The way she moves really talks to me
I'm going out of my mind
`Cause the way that she winds...is truly divine

She takes her time as she approaches me
Then she gives me the sign as she moves her behind
That only God would design

[Chorus]
Like a bullet from a gun the dj makes a run
When she feels a beat my baby
I can't get her off the floor
She keeps me dancin' 'til dawn

The lights are low
She likes to dance for me
It's making me high `cause the look in her eye
Is hot as July
Hey

The night is young, gold bar's the place to be
The music is right cause the dj is tight
Zappa into Barry White, yeah!

Lenny Kravitz,"Good morning
Nice to see you
How you've been
The beginning of another lovely day
Oh oh oh oh oh

Good morning

Get up put your feet on the ground
Wake up to an ice cold shower
The coffee's hot but the cream is sour

So get up

Top of the morning to you
Good morning to you
Hey
Oh oh oh oh oh
Good morning
Good morning
Can I walk you to the train
Would you like to get a bagel on the way
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Good morning
Get on and we go downtown
Get off and go in the tower
The boss is old but he has the power

So we're up
Top of the morning to you
Good morning to you
Hey
Oh oh oh oh oh
It's another day in the world in which we live

I've got to find a way
To get past what I can't forgive
And no matter what we've got to try to move along
So sing a song
You can't go wrong
Good morning
Nice to see you
How you been
The beginning of another, lovely day
Oh oh oh oh oh
Good morning",Good Morning
Lenny Kravitz,"[Verse 1]
The clouds are forming
She comes again
I'll go and walk with her
Along the Seine
Soon she'll be storming
Here comes the wind
But that don't bother me
'Cause she's my friend

I love the rain
I love the rain

[Verse 2]
I've held our memories
All of these years
So many good times
And many tears
I share my dreams with her
I share my fears
So I just walk with her until she veers
Off in the distance

I love the rain
I love the rain
I love
I love
I love the rain

[Verse 3]
Oh
Just as she always does
She has to leave
With her she takes my heart
Into her breeze
Sometimes I think that she
Just likes to tease
Still I'll be waiting
For her reprise

I love the rain
I love the rain
I love the rain
I love the rain
I love the rain

Lenny Kravitz,"Will I make it out of here alive
Will I ever get to see my unborn child
Will I ever get to live my own dreams
Cause this hell where I am now just ain't for me
If I could just kiss you goodnight... Oh

[Chorus]
I wanna... I wanna go home
I just wanna get along with my life
I wanna... I wanna go home
I just wanna get along with my life

Will I have to take a life does that make peace

I don't wanna stay out here another day... Oh
I'm just trying to get back home in any way
How I miss all the good times... Ya ya

Lenny Kravitz,"He broke your heart
He took your soul
You're hurt inside
Because there's a hole
You need some time
To be alone
Then you will find
What you always know

I'm the one who really loves you baby
I've been knocking at your door

As long as I'm living, I'll be waiting
As long as I'm breathing, I'll be there
Whenever you call me, I'll be waiting
Whenever you need me, I'll be there

I've seen you cry
Into the night
I feel your pain
Can I make it right
I realized there's no end inside

Yet still I'll wait
For you to see the light

I'm the one who really loves you baby
I can't take it anymore

As long as I'm living, I'll be waiting
As long as I'm breathing, I'll be there
Whenever you call me, I'll be waiting
Whenever you need me, I'll be there

You are my only I've ever known
That makes me feel this way
Couldn't on my own
I want to be with you until we're old

You have the love you need right in front of you
Please come home

As long as I'm living, I'll be waiting
As long as I'm breathing, I'll be there
Whenever you call me, I'll be waiting
Whenever you need me, I'll be there",I'll Be Waiting
Lenny Kravitz,"Don't you let it all pass you by
Looking through life's window pane
Don't you sit around wasting time
That would be a crying shame
There's a power that's deep inside
And it burns just like a flame
Just believe and you will see that God
Will shower you like pouring rain
If you want it
You can change your world today
If you want it
Just break free and walk away
There's a reason
For you to explore
Why you're here
What do you say
And the beauty is that you're the one
Who controls just how you play
There's a choice that you need to make
One is ore and one is clay
So drop your chains and take up your cross
And let Jesus make your way
If you want it
You can change
Your world today
If you want it
Just break free and walk away
If you want it
You can change your evil ways
If you want it
Just break free and walk away

If you want it
You can change your world today
If you want it
Just break free and walk away
If you want it
You can change your evil ways
If you want it

Just break free
And walk away",If You Want It
Lenny Kravitz,"Papa
Who's to blame
Why you never had your fortune and fame
Papa what did you gain
To leave the love you had for a two-bit dame

Papa
Why did you turn your back
Why didn't you stay on track
Why did you leave and make her cry

Papa
You meant the world to me
Why did you abandon me
Now it's a long and sad goodbye

Papa
What is this game
With all that cheating you did you're gonna go insane

Papa
I am in pain
'Cause on the day that you left
You said I'd do the same

Papa
Why did you turn your back
Why didn't you stay on track
Why did you leave and make her cry

Papa
You meant the world to me
Why did you abandon me
Now it's a long and sad goodbye

Lenny Kravitz,"Martin Luther King, he had a vision

He died so we could see, that was his mission

(A black woman)
And when they walked the streets, they were in danger

What lives inside of me
Will find its way to be
It all starts with a dream
The dawn of a new day
The God inside of you
Will always see you through
So hold on to your dream
No one can take the dream
From your heart
From your heart

You can try to shake my reason
But you'll never take me down
You can fill me full of bullets
But I'm built on solid ground

So all I have to say
Is I'm not going away
It's much bigger than me
God's will will always be

It all starts with a dream
The dawn of a new day
The God inside of you
Will always see you through
So hold on to your dream
No one can take the dream
From your heart
From your heart

Amen 
Amen
Amen
Amen

You will never take my passion
'Cause it always will remain
Even if I lose this battle, oh yeah
It's just blood inside my veins

That's all that I will say 
The dream won't go away
You can't steal from me
What God gave me for free

It all starts with a dream
The dawn of a new day
The God inside of you
Will always see you through
So hold on to your dream
No one can take the dream
From your heart
From your heart

Go shorty,

I've seen the world, I've seen it all

Lenny White,"As the silence of seasons on
We relive abridge sails afloat
As to call light the soul shall sing
Of the velvet sailors course on
Of the velvet sailors course on
Shine or moons send me memories trail
Oer days of forgotten tales
Course the compass to offer
Into a time that we've all seen on
Into a time that we've all seen on
High the memory carry on
While the moments start to linger
Sail away among your dreams
The strength regains us in between our time
The strength regains us in between our time
As we shall speak to differ also
The ends meet the river's son
So the ends meet the river's son
Ours the story shall we carry on
And search the forest of the sun
We dream as we dream, dream as one
And I do think very well that the son might take you silently
They move fast, they tell me
There's someone, rainbow
Alternate tune
In the days of summer so long
We danced as evening sang their song
We wander out the day so long
And I do feel very well that the evenings take you silently
They move round, sunlight
Seeing ground
Whispers of clay, alternate ways
Softer messages bringing light
To a truth long forgotten on
As we shall speak to differ also
The ends meet the river's son
So the ends meet the river's son
I reach over and the fruit of life stands still
Stand awhile we search our past anew
The music sings of love you knew
We walk around the story
Out in the city running free
Sands of companions sides that be
The strength of the meeting lies with you
Wait all the more regard your past
Schoolgates remind us of our class
Chase all confusion away with us
Stand on hills of long forgotten yesterdays
Pass amongst your memories told returnig ways
As certain as we walk today
We walk around the story
Out in the city running free
Days pass as seconds turn the key
The strength of the moment lies with you
Don the cap and close your eyes
Imagine all the glorious challenge
Iron metal cast to others
Distant drums
Force the bit betwenn the mouth of freedom
Didn't we learn to fly
Remember to sail the skies
Distant suns
Will we reach
Winds allow
Other skylines
Other skylines to hold you
Relayer, all the dying cried before you
Relayer, we've rejoiced in all their meaning
Relayer, we advance, we retrace our stories
Like a dreamer all our lives
Are only lost begotten changes
We relive in seagull's pages
Outward ways
Things are all in colours
And the size of others shall send you forward
Arranged to sail you toward
A peace of mind
Will we reach
Winds allow
Other skylines
Other skylines to hold you
Relayer, all the passion spent on one cross
Relayer, sail the futile wars they suffer
Relayer, we advance, we retrace our story
Fail safe now
Stand on hills of long forgotten yesterdays
Pass amongst your memories told returning ways
As certain as we walk today
Press over moments leaving you
Out in the city runnig free
Days pass as seconds turn the key
The strength of the moment lies with you
Out tender outward lights of you
Shine over mountains make the view
The strength of you seeing lies with you
Ours entrance we surely carry on
And change the passing as the sun
We don't even need to try, we are one
And I do think very well as the truth unfolds you silently
They move time, rainbows

Alternate tune, alternate tune
Rainbows, soft light
Alternate view

Lenny White,"It's not far down to paradise
At least it's not for me

And find tranquility
The canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see

No reason to pretend
And if the wind is right you can find the joy
Of innocence again
The canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see

Takes me away
To where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
And soon I will be free

When I'm sailing
All caught up in the reverie

And when the wind is right you can sail away
And find serenity

It was a very good year
It was a very good year for small town girls
And soft summer nights
Wed hide from the lights
On the village green
When I was seventeen

When I was twenty-one
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for city girls
Who lived up the stair
With all that perfumed hair
And it came undone
When I was twenty-one

When I was thirty-five
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for blue-blooded girls
Of independent means
Wed ride in limousines
Their chauffeurs would drive
When I was thirty-five

But now the days grow short
Im in the autumn of the year
And now I think of my life as vintage wine

All will be revealed

Talk an' song from tongues of lilting grace

Like thoughts inside a dream

We were young and we knew, and our eyes were alive
Deep inside we knew our love was true

Would invite us to begin the dance

And yesterday was all we had

Oh, after the love has gone
How could you lead me one
And not let me stay around?
Oh, after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?
 
For a while to love each other
With all we would ever need
Love was strong for so long
Never knew that what was wrong
Baby, wasn't right
We tried to find what we had 
Til sadness was all we shared
We were scared this affair 
Would lead our love into

Not to heed them is a bad reflection
They'll show you the way to what you have been seeking
To ignore them you're only cheating
 
So come, take me by the hand, we'll leave this troubled land
Why don't you get away? Get away
Lay awake at night till the sun comes up in the morning
Never excited; it all seems boring
Make up your mind which way to go about it
Choose your road, just don't doubt it

And then you danced into my life
A lovely girl from a story book
I fell in love with just one look
Midnight girl

Your eyes were filled with such mystery
We held each other tenderly
And just before you spoke your name
The clock struck twelve and you ran away

Kissing and holding you next to me

The way you touch me when you lay by my side.
And that look you get in your eyes when we love
Makes me hate myself for what I'm thinkin' of.

Had a childhood sweetheart
We were always hand in hand
I was hightop shoes and shirt tails
Suzy was in pig tails
I know I loved her even then
You know my papa disapproved it

But I told them time and time again
""Don't you know I was made to love her
Built a world all around her""

Lenore Raphael,"There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No greater love,
No heart so true

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me

Than what you sing to me

You're the sweetest thing

You are mine alone.

Lenore Raphael,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is
Lenore Troia,"They can come take it all away 
Break you heart by the light of day 
Drown your love in a distant bay so lonely

See the time melting over the clocks

The rocks that saves me 
It saves me 

That's why I wander and follow La Vie Dansante 
On the night wind that takes me 
Just where I want 
That's all I want

Every night wears a new disguise 
And I live when a new surprise surrenders

Every stop, there's a place to start 
If you know how to play the part with feeling 
I play with feeling 

Why don't you wander and follow La Vie Dansante

Lenore VonStein,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies

Talking perfectly loud

Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

Sees the sun going down

They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

Te he prometido que te he de olvidar 
Cuanto has querido y yo te supe dar
Solo y herido así me dejas
Sabiendo que mañana iras con otro al altar 

Lloraras, Lloraras por tu capricho 
Si yo se que es a mi a quien quieres
No podrás ser feliz con ningún otro
Pues conmigo conociste el amor

Cuando las rosas
Del rosal son como Celia

Ahora solo me pregunto
Quizás me quiera
Y no hago mas
Que repetir tu nombre Celia

A la iglesia por vez primera

Con los brazos cruzados se me fue la fortuna
Y la inmensa aventura de mi último

Entre cuatro paredes que me ocultan del sol
Con los brazos cruzados soy igual que esa ola
En espuma se rompe contra el duro espiral

Léo Ferré,"Mon frère était un assassin
Qui travaillait avec la lame
Et chaque soir après l' turbin
Il faisait travailler sa femme
Ma soeur écrivait de beaux vers
Dans un journal hebdomadaire
Et si son verbe était amer
C'est qu'on avait tué l' libraire

C'est c' qu'on appelle en vérité
Une famille respectable
Et l'assassin fut invité
A mettre les pieds sous la table

Mon père avait un bar-tabac
Que fréquentaient de drôl's de têtes
Ils vivaient tous dans l'aléa
Et papa plaçait leur galette
Ma soeur accordait au comptoir
D'incommensurables chopines
Bossant du matin jusqu'au soir
Cherchant une rime à rapine

C'est c' qu'on appelle en vérité
Une famille infatigable
Le travail c'est la liberté
C'est une chose formidable

Ma mère alors avait un tic
C'était le complexe d'Oedipe
Ce n'est peut-être pas très chic
Mais j'avais déjà des principes
Ma belle soeur je vous l'ai dit
Avait un métier unanime
Elle aimait beaucoup son mari
Trouvant cela plus légitime

C'est c' qu'on appell' en vérité
Une famille véritable
Où l'instinct de propriété
Se révelait inéluctable

Tonton tata soudain fauchés
Fatigués de l'Europe flasque
Devinrent tous deux attachés
A une ambassade fantasque
On chuchote sous le manteau
Que tous les soirs à Buenos Aires
Tonton tata dans leur huit-clos
Font dire maints et maints rosaires

C'est c' qu'on appell' en vérité
Une famille présentable
Et si tonton fut arrêté
Ça parait à peine croyable

D'autres frangins d'autres frangines
Y'en avait qui faisaient partout
Faut avouer que pour la ligne
Ma mère en avait pris un coup
Et malgré l'odeur d'ammoniac
Le père aimait à se repaître
Pour qu'on lui fout' le prix cognac
Y'avait plus tell'ment de kilomètres

C'est c' qu'on appell' en vérité

Et puis m'en ferais des nappes si belles
Que nous mangerions l'amour à genoux

Si tes yeux étaient de vieilles étoiles
De celles qu'on voit mais qui ne sont plus
J'y regarderais derrière la toile
De ce grand tableau de bleu suspendu

Si tes cheveux fous étaient la misaine
Et que de ton coeur je fisse un bateau
Tout en remontant le cours de la Seine
Tu serais Paris et moi matelot

Si ton astre noir où je m'illumine
Était le calice et si j'étais Dieu
J'y boirais la Mort jusqu'à la racine
Et puis m'en irais refaire les cieux

Si les soleils morts des plaines célestes
Descendaient un jour dans ton corps éteint
Il luirait encore à tes seins modestes
Un peu de leur flamme un peu de ma faim

Un peu de leur flamme un peu de ma faim...",Chanson Pour Elle

Alors quand saut'ra la planète
Si jamais sonnent les trompettes
On s'en foutra divinement
Nous deux...

Les gens vont me traiter d'artiste
De sans coeur et si j'en suis triste
Je n'en serai pas étonné...
Car ce coeur pitoyable et tendre
A toi seule qui sus le prendre
Depuis longtemps je l'ai donné...
Tout comme aujourd'hui je te donne
Cette chanson de fin d'automne
Qui se voulait chanson d'amour...
Je ne suis ni saint ni apôtre
Et pour penser encore aux autres
Le temps qui me reste est trop court...
En attendant ma tourterelle
Ma fille à moi ma toute belle
Ma frangin' d'amour ma maman
Puisque nos âmes vagabondent 
Embrassons-nous tout près des lames
De l'océan des mauvais jours
Nous deux...
Et puis à nos amours fidèles
Au coeur des neiges éternelles
Allons nous perdre pour toujours

Léo Ferré,"Nous aurons des lits pleins d'odeurs légères,
Des divans profonds comme des tombeaux,
Et d'étranges fleurs sur des étagères,
Ecloses pour nous sous des ciels plus beaux.

Usant à l'envie leurs chaleurs dernières,
Nos deux coeurs seront deux vastes flambeaux,
Qui réfléchiront leurs doubles lumières
Dans nos deux esprits, ces miroirs jumeaux
Un soir fait de rose et de bleu mystique,
Nous échangerons un éclair unique,
Comme un long sanglot, tout chargé d'adieux 
Et plus tard un Ange, entr' ouvrant les portes
Viendra ranimer, fidèle et joyeux,

Vous aviez vos portraits sur les murs de nos villes
Noirs de barbe et de nuits hirsutes menaçants

Parce qu'à prononcer vos noms sont difficiles
Y cherchait un effet de peur sur les passants

Nul ne semblait vous voir français de préférence

Avaient écrit sous vos photos MORTS POUR LA FRANCE

Tout avait la couleur uniforme du givre
A la fin février pour vos derniers moments
Et c'est alors que l'un de vous dit calmement
Bonheur à tous bonheur à ceux qui vont survivre
Je meurs sans haine en moi pour le peuple allemand

Adieu la peine et le plaisir adieu les roses
Adieu la vie adieu la lumière et le vent

Des fleurs du mal de dix-sept ans

Pour le péché que tu fais naître
Au sein des plus raides vertus
Et pour l'ennui qui va paraître
Au coin des lits où tu n'es plus
Pour les ballots que tu fais paître
Dans le pré comme des moutons
Pour ton honneur à ne paraître
Jamais à la télévision

Pour tout cela et plus encor
Pour la solitude des rois
Le rire des têtes de morts
Le moyen de tourner la loi
Et qu'on ne me fasse point taire
Et que je chante pour ton bien

Ne sont pas faites pour les chiens...

A te ramer à t'affoler
Voilà que tu cherches ton bien
Dans les vitrines de ma nuit
Achète-moi je ne vaux rien
Puisque l'amour n'a pas de prix
Comme une louve sous son loup	
Quand je vous ferai des petits
Vous banderez vos yeux jaloux
Avec un loup de satin gris
Tout comme est gris le jour qui va
Petite soeur écoutez-moi
Comme un bateau entre mes doigts
Vous coulerez je vous le dois
Vous coulerez je vous le dois

Je vous aime d'amour

Si la mort avait ton regard
Je meurs ce soir sans regarder
Et te demanderai ma part
Au bord du vide et des baisers
L'amour ça ne meurt que la nuit
Alors habille-toi en moi
Avec un peu de rouge aussi
J'aurai ta mort entre mes bras
Lorsque vous me mettrez en croix
Dans votre forêt bien apprise
Et que je boirai tout en bas
La sève tant et tant promise
Je vous engouffrerai de sang
Pendant que vous serez charmée
Et je vous donnerai l'enfant
Que vous n'avez jamais été
Que vous n'avez jamais été

Et pour cela, préfère l'Impair
Plus vagu' et plus soluble dans l'air
Sans rien en lui pèse ou qui pose,

Il faut aussi que tu n'ailles point
Choisir tes mots sans quelque méprise,
Rien de plus cher que la chanson grise
Où l'Indécis au Précis se joint.

C'est des beaux yeux derrière des voiles,
C'est le grand jour tremblant de midi,
C'est par un ciel d'automn' attiédi,
Le bleu fouillis des claires étoiles,

Car nous voulons la Nuanc' encor,
Pas la Couleur, rien que la nuance !
Oh ! la nuance seule fiance
Le rêv' au rêve et la flût' au cor !

Fuis du plus loin la Pointe assassine,
L'esprit cruel et le Rire impur,
Qui font pleurer les yeux de l'Azur,
Et tout cet aïl de basse cuisine !

Prends l'éloquence et tords-lui son cou !
Tu feras bien en train d'énergie,
De rendre un peu la Rime assagie.
Si l'on n'y veille, elle ira jusqu'où ?

Ô qui dira les torts de la Rime ?
Quel enfant sourd ou quel nègre fou
Nous a forgé ce bijou d'un sou
Qui sonne creux et faux sous la lime ?

De la musique encore et toujours !
Que ton vers soit la chose envolée
Qu'on sent qui fuit d'une âme en allée
Vers d'autres cieux à d'autres amours.

Et tout le reste est littérature.",Art Poetique

Un bas quartier de bohémiens
Dont la belle jeunesse s'use
A démêler le tien du mien

Ils disent la bonne aventure
Pour des piments et du vin doux

On passe la nuit claire à boire
On danse en frappant dans ses mains
On n'a pas le temps de le croire
Il fait grand jour et c'est demain
On revient d'une seule traite
Gais sans un sou vaguement gris
Avec des fleurs plein les charrettes
Son destin dans la paume écrit

J'ai pris la main d'une éphémère
Qui m'a suivi dans ma maison
Elle avait les yeux d'outre-mer
Elle en montrait la déraison
Elle avait la marche légère
Et de longues jambes de faon
J'aimais déjà les étrangères
Quand j'étais un petit enfant

Celle-ci par-là vite vite
De l'odeur des magnolias
Sa robe tomba tout de suite
Quand ma hâte la délia
En ces temps-là j'étais crédule
Un mot m'était promission
Et je prenais les campanules
Pour les fleurs de la passion

A chaque fois tout recommence
Toute musique me séduit
Et la plus banale romance
M'est l'éternelle poésie

De ma mandoline :
Pour toi, j'ai fait, pour toi, cette chanson
Cruelle et câline.

Je chanterai tes yeux d'or et d'onyx
Purs de toutes ombres,
Puis le Léthé de ton sein, puis le Styx
De tes cheveux sombres.

Comme la voix d'un mort qui chanterait
Du fond de sa fosse,
Maîtresse, entends monter vers ton retrait
Ma voix aigre et fausse,

Puis je louerai beaucoup, comme il convient,
Cette chair bénie
Dont le parfum opulent me revient
Les nuits d'insomnie.

Et pour finir, je dirai le baiser
De ta lèvre rouge,
Et ta douceur à me martyriser,
Mon ange ! ma Gouge !

Et puis, voici mon coeur qui ne bat que pour vous ;

L'humble présent soit doux

J'arrive tout couvert encore de rosée
Que le vent du matin vient glacer à mon front.
Souffrez que ma fatigue, à vos pieds reposée

Toute sonore encor de vos derniers baisers ;
Laissez-là s'apaiser de la bonne tempête,

Qu'il se la chante à White Chapel
Je suis allergique à la brume,
J'ai acheté avec les rentes
Que me rapportent mes chansons
A un taulier de Barbizon
Une guinguette pas marrante
Même au plus beau de la saison.
C'est pour mes bell's indifférentes
Que je voulais mettre en prison...

Ces filles-là sont toutes celles
Qui, jadis, quand j'avais du coeur
M'assassinaient d'un air moqueur
Ou bien se prétendaient pucelles...

L'important c'est qu'elles soient là
En frêles robes de gala
Et qu'elles soient restées charmantes

Elles ont maintenant peur de moi...

Ell's ne seront plus à personne
Elles garderont leur beauté
Pas plus qu'il n'y aura d'été
Pour elles ne viendra l'automne...
Dans ce jardin où se lamente
A tout jamais le vent d'hiver
Sur le pick-up c'est le même air
D'une musique sidérante
Et qui leur tape sur les nerfs.
Et mes belles indifférentes
Sont sensibles à ce truc pervers...

Il faut les voir quand je radine
Grandi par mes talons bottiers
Et que je prends un air altier
En faisant siffler ma badine...
Elles m'apportent déférentes
Mes cigarettes et mon whisky
Mais je ne dis jamais merci
Et garde une moue méprisante
A la manière de Mackie
Et mes belles indifférentes
De leurs mains glacées me supplient...

Elles supplient pendant des heures
Ce n'est pas du travail bâclé,
Et tout à coup je ferme à clé
Et je les laisse là qui pleurent...
N'écoutez pas les gens qui mentent
En disant qu'ils ont rencontré
L'une ou l'autre, ce n'est pas vrai
C'est des sosies ou des parentes

Viendrait traîner sa traîne
Dans le ciel mouillé
Et partout il flotterait
Des signes d'amitié
Comme des regrets.

Moi qui n'irai jamais
A Tahiti, Tahiti
Car il faut bien des sous
Pour faire Paris-Tahiti
J' mettrai la Tour Eiffel
Dans mon chapeau et d'en haut
Je confondrai les ciels
De Tahiti à Paris
Moi qui n'irai jamais
A Tahiti, Tahiti
Je reconnaîtrai bien
Monsieur Gauguin
Et ses pinceaux de majesté
Qui v'naient piquer
Un peu de mauve
Sur les quais de la Seine
Quand la Seine ressemble
A Tahiti
Comme une amie",Tahiti
Léo Ferré,"Dans un vieux phono
D'Aristo
Un phono d'avant
L' magnéto
J'ai passé ma têt' de loup
Ma peau d' pilou
Et pas pour des clous
Car au beau milieu du concert
A côté d'un' vals' à Schubert
Un saxo costaud
Le dièze à l'air
Montrait c' qu'il avait d' plus cher

La zizique à poil
C'est fatal
Ça colle à la peau
Mes agneaux

Et l'instrumento
Qui n'est pas manchot
Ça vous pass' la main
Sur le genre humain
En deux coups d' marteaux
V'là l' piano
Qui vous upercute
En clef d'Ut
La zizique
Ça t'agrippe
Et te pique
Tout's tes nippes

Dans un' vieille machine
A zinzin
Un' machine à couiner
L' refrain
J'ai laissé mon "" Tchaïkowsky ""
Et patati
Ma quinzaine aussi
Lorsqu' au beau milieu d' l'interview,
Derrière un' romance à deux sous,
Un batteur patent
Tambour battant
Battait dans mon palpitant

La zizique à poil,
C'est fatal,
Ça s' met dans la peau,
Mes agneaux

Qu' ça soye à Pékin
Ou à Saint Glinglin
Ou bien je n' sais où
D'ailleurs on s'en fout
En deux coups d' chorus
V'là Vénus
Qui vous met l' starter
A l'envers
La zizique,
Ça t'agrippe
Et te pique
Tout's tes nippes.

Dans un vieux bastringue
A tanguer
A tanguer des fringues
Et des pieds,
J'ai planqué "" La mer calmée ""
Et j'ai dansé
Sur cell' de Trénet
Lorsqu' au beau milieu d' la coda
Sans savoir comment ni pourquoi
Un fox trot trottant
trottait content
Perdant son ""la"" et son temps

La zizique à poil
Dans un bal,
On n'y voit qu' la peau,
Mes agneaux,

Qu' la peau et les os
Qui jouent du xylo,
Faut bien fair' du Tam Tam 
C'est dans l' programme
En deux coups d' gratti
V'là l' gratteur
Qui vous gratte ici
Ou ailleurs
La zizique,
Ça t'agrippe
Et te pique
Tout's tes nippes

Dans un' vieill' rengaine
A rumba
Un' rengaine à gaine
Et à bas
J'ai r'trouvé mes bell's années
Cell's qu'on comptait
Qu'on comptait jamais
Lorsqu' au beau mitan d' la chanson
Derrière un accord de dix ronds,
Tout s'est arrêté
J'ai tout paumé
J' peux plus finir mon couplet

La zizique à poil
C'est câlin
Mêm' si t'as qu' du poil
Dans la main,

Tarazim boum boum
Ça va faire un boum
Mêm' si les frangins
Trouv'nt que j' vais pas bien
Y'a qu' un' seul' façon,
Mon mignon

Mais ce qui me chagrine, oh pas des tas
C'est que tu te disais mon vrai p'tit pote

Comme un miteux, comme un pauvre mec

Tes embrassades et caetera
Avec une gueule comme celle que t'as
Bravo mon vieux, chapeau mon gars
T'as du talent, y faut que tu t'pousses

Tu devrais donner dans la rousse
On est pénard, on peut trahir
Seulement voilàm y faut choisir
Etre dégueulasse ou bien Seigneur
Toi t'as pas du mal, tu n'a pas d'cœur
Je t'en veux pas mon vieil Iscariote
C'est pas de ta faute, c'est dans la peau
C'est des trucs puissants les bank-notes!

Mais une autre fois vas-y franco
Viens donc me voir et je te ferai le prix
C'est pas que je râle, pour ce que je t'en dis 
T'as pas pensé à mon standing

Leur âme est en carafe sous les ponts de la Seine

Et qui lèchent leurs mains de plume et d'amitié
Avec dans le museau la fidèle lumière
Qui les conduit vers les pays d'absurdité

Ce sont de drôl's de typ's qui regardent les fleurs
Et qui voient dans leurs plis des sourires de femme
Ce sont de drôl's de typ's qui chantent le malheur
Sur les pianos du coeur et les violons de l'âme

Que la littérature accrochera plus tard
A leur spectre gelé au-dessus des poubelles
Où remourront leurs vers comme un effet de l'Art

Et savent s'arrêter pour bénir les chevaux
Ils marchent dans l'horreur la tête dans des îles
Où n'abordent jamais les âmes des bourreaux

Sur le visage de la terre
Et les clients les plus malins
Venaient y lire leurs misères

Dorée par des millions d'orfèvres

Et les aveugles de Paris

Léo Ferré,"O fins d'automne, hiver, printemps trempés de boue,
Endormeuses saisons ! je vous aime et vous loue
D'envelopper ainsi mon coeur et mon cerveau
D'un linceul vaporeux et d'un vague tombeau ;

Dans cette grande plaine où l'autan froid se joue,
Où par les longues nuits la girouette s'enroue,
Mon âme mieux qu'au temps du tiède renouveau
Ouvrira largement ses ailes de corbeau.

Rien n'est plus doux au coeur plein de choses funèbres,
Et sur qui dès longtemps descendent les frimas,
O blafardes saisons, reines de nos climats,

Que l'aspect permanent de vos pâles ténèbres,
Si ce n'est, par un soir sans lune, deux à deux,
D'endormir la douleur sur un lit hasardeux.",Brumes Et Pluies

Pour faire une litière au loup

Léo Ferré,"Viens sur mon coeur, âme cruelle et sourde,
Tigre adoré, monstre aux airs indolents ;
Je veux longtemps plonger mes doigts tremblants
Dans l'épaisseur de ta crinière lourde ;
Dans tes jupons remplis de ton parfum
Ensevelir ma tête endolorie,
Et respirer, comme une fleur flétrie,
Le doux relent de mon amour défunt.

Je veux dormir ! dormir plutôt que vivre !
Dans un sommeil douteux comme la mort,
J'étalerai mes baisers sans remords
Sur ton beau corps poli comme le cuivre.
Pour engloutir mes sanglots apaisés
Rien ne me vaut l'abîme de ta couche ;
L'oubli puissant habite sur ta bouche,
Et le Léthé coule dans tes baisers.

A mon destin, désormais mon délice,
J'obéirai comme un prédestiné ;
Martyr docile, innocent condamné,
Dont la ferveur attise le supplice,
Je sucerai, pour noyer ma rancoeur,

En se tordant ainsi qu'un serpent sur la braise,
Et pétrissant ses seins sur le fer de son busc,
Laissant couler ces mots tout imprégnés de musc :
- "" Moi, j'ai la lèvre humide, et je sais la science
De perdre au fond d'un lit l'antique conscience.
Je sèche tous les pleurs sur mes seins triomphants,
Et fait rire les vieux du rire des enfants,
Je remplace, pour qui me voit nue et sans voiles,
La lune, le soleil, le ciel et les étoiles !
Je suis, mon cher savant, si docte aux voluptés,
Lorsque j'étouffe un homme en mes bras redoutés,
Ou lorsque j'abandonne aux morsures mon buste,
Timide et libertine, et fragile et robuste,
Que sur ces matelas qui se pâment d'émoi,
Les anges impuissants se damneraient pour moi ! ""

Quand elle eut de mes os sucé toute la moelle,
Et que languissamment je me tournai vers elle
Pour lui rendre un baiser d'amour, je ne vis plus
Qu'une outre aux flancs gluants, toute pleine de pus !
Je fermai les deux yeux, dans ma froide épouvante,
Et quand je les rouvris à la clarté vivante,
A mes côtés, au lieu du mannequin puissant
Qui semblait avoir fait provision de sang,
Tremblait confusément des débris de squelette,
Qui d'eux-même rendaient le cri d'une girouette

De n'être pas favorisés.

Puisqu'on dit que je vous dois tout,
Vous me devez au moins mes peines,
Mais c'est un secret entre nous,
Nous n'avons plus rien à nous dire
Et que vos beaux yeux inhumains
Fassent à d'autres tous les sourires
Que vous étaliez sur mon pain.

O Notre-Dame de mes traites,
Que vous n'avez jamais payées,
Vous dont la robe bleue est faite,
De tous mes papiers bleus d'huissier,
De mes musiques sans commandes,
Je vous ai fort bien habillée,
A d'autres faites donc l'offrande
De votre riche pauvreté.

O Notre-Dame de misère
Mon coeur est au Mont de Piété,
Je l'ai laissé sur vos prières,
Mais ne peux plus l'y retirer
Pour moi que sauriez-vous donc faire,
Sinon faire un chemin de croix
Qui descendrait de mon calvaire
Où d'autres font leurs premiers pas.

O Notre-Dame de bohème

Si vous voulez que je vous aime,
Vous qui m'avez bien trop aimé
Il vous reste une chose à faire,
Vous ne pouvez la refuser,

Que les soleils marins teignaient de mille feux,
Et que leurs grands piliers, droits et majestueux,
Rendaient pareils, le soir, aux grottes basaltiques.

Les houles, en roulant les images des cieux,
Mêlaient d'une façon solennelle et mystique
Les tout-puissants accords de leur riche musique
Aux couleurs du couchant reflété par mes yeux

C'est là que j'ai vécu dans les voluptés calmes,
Au milieu de l'azur, des vagues, des splendeurs,
Et des esclaves nus, tout imprégnés d'odeurs,

Qui me rafraîchissaient le front avec des palmes,
Et dont l'unique soin était d'approfondir
Le secret douloureux qui me faisait languir.",La Vie Antérieure

And I don't want to pray for the love

Castle away

Over dreams, I have picked out
A perfect come true

Too far away
For you to say come back some
Other day

And though you don't believe
That they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you
Would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

Over hearts, I have painfully
Turned every stone
Just to find, I had found what
I've searched to discover
I've come much too far for me

The love that I sought can never
Be mine

That they do
They do come true

Come true when I looked at you

Would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

Say improbable
What do they know

Will find

I saw your child sleeping
Behind an open door

Shining up from the floor
And the fish swam like moonlight
Through your child's closing door
And morning is the long way home

The fisherman was drowning
By his broken heel
His screams were tiny bubbles
And his tongue made of steel
When he died his teeth made stones

And the grasses waved like hair

Leo Kottke,"Tilt Billings saw a guitar in a pawn shop window
Not much to look at but he knew that he'd found
That old student Prince that they made years ago
So easy to play, what unbeatable sound

Paid twenty bucks and grabbed his guitar
Still be a steal at ten times the dough
It was amazing how a mere beginner
Could play just a few notes and sound like a pro

He'd play his heart out when he was at parties
Guys would get jealous but girls were impressed
They'd ask how he did it? He'd say
""Nothin' to it, with this kind of guitar it brings out my best""

One night when he had the room captivated
He took five and set down his prince
When a drunk stumbled by and sat down where he laid it
And he's never sounded quite the same since

Leo Kottke,"She's sixty-one years old and hiding in a school bus
Kind of objectionable
With a heart like a fist

She stood on a street in Norfork in a pea-coat and a headache
watching the traffic splash by
When a four day clown in a pick-up truck drove her out to the woods
Down a gravel lane, down a dirt road, down some dust on the grass
To a shadow, with some bricks around it

Near a pecan tree, near a boulder, near a dog, near invisible
He dobbed his hat and scuffed his heel
And puffed real hard on his cheap cigar
And he spewed the smoke out in the air
And asked her if that was a wig on her head
Or if it was real hair

He laughed real loud and said she was cute
And then he leaned over and said ""excuse me""
And put the cigar out in the dog's face
""I live here"" he said
He went inside

She turned around and walked past the dog
Back up the dust on the grass, past the pecan tree
Back up the dirt road, back up the gravel lane
And back to Norfolk

Back there at his place late at night, when the owls congregate
And the snakes sleep, when the trucks hit the spacers in the overpass
And the storm drains cough up dust and cigarette filters
purge like frogs at the side of the road

Back there, down the gravel lane, down the dirt road
Down some dust on the grass, past the pecan tree to the shadow
With some bricks around it

Back there, late at night, back there in the dark
Back there in the dust, back there
The dog burst into flame

Anyhow, time went by, anyhow snap crackers and stone soup
Walking on cornflakes and stopping blocks
Anyhow, she went back to where the dog blew up
She tried her luck, she went back, maybe she could paint the porch
Maybe she could fix the roof, maybe she could build a roof

She told him ""you can't smoke cigars, though, I'm too damn frail""
And he said ""I won't""
Then he lit a cigarette and dropped his hat
He said, ""It's OK, I have a cat","""Husbandry"""

They've got guitars and trumpets and sweet senoritas who won't want to let you go 
You'd never believe such a happy town had a street called Sonora's death row

Inside Amanda's we were all dancing with six of Amanda's gals
I won some silver at 7-card stud so I was outdoing my pals
But the whiskey and mescal and peso cigars drove me outside for some air 
Somebody whispered ""Your life or your money,"" I reached but my gun wasn't there

I woke up face down in Amanda's back alley, aware of the fool I had been
Rushed to a saddle and grabbed someone's rifle and entered Amanda's again
Where I saw my partners twirling my pistol and throwing my money around
Blinded by anger, I jacked the lever and one of them fell to the ground

Amanda's got silent like night in the desert, my friends stared in pure disbelief
Amanda was kneeling beside the dead cowboy plainly expressing her grief
And as I bowed my head a tremble shot through me, my pistol was still at my side
I felt my pockets and there was my money, I fell to my knees and I cried

A nightmare of mescal was all that it was, no one had robbed me at all
I wish I was dreaming the sound of the gallows they're testing just outside the wall

""They comb their hair with porcupines and loofah their feet
And they become indignant when you threaten them with meat
Their windows grin like pumpkins filled with candles and beads
Their beds are all futonic and there's babies on their knees.""
""But my mother wears a hat,"" he said, ""extruded from a tank
And my sister reads good housekeeping and worships at the bank
My grandma loves Pat Robertson says he's it that's that
And my wife says I'm a lunatic but hippie chicks are where it's at.""

Leo Maiberger,"The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile
Léo Marjane,"Of all the boys I've known, and I've known some
Until I first met you, I was lonesome
And when you came in sight, dear, my heart grew light
And this old world seemed new to me

You're really swell, I have to admit you
Deserve expressions that really fit you
And so I've racked my brain, hoping to explain
All the things that you do to me

Bei mir bist do schon, please let me explain
Bei mir bist do schon means you're grand
Bei mir bist do schon, again I'll explain
It means you're the fairest in the land

I could say ""Bella, bella"", even ""sehr wunderbar""
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are

I've tried to explain, bei mir bist do schon
So kiss me and say you understand

Bei mir bist do schon, you've heard it all before
 but let me try to explain
Bei mir bist do schon means that you're grand
Bei mir bist do schon, it's such an old refrain
 and yet I should explain
It means I am begging for your hand

I could say ""Bella, bella"", even ""sehr wunderbar""
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are

I could say ""Bella, bella"", even ""sehr wunderbar""

Leo Parker,"In my solitude
You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love
I sit in my chair

Filled with despair
There's no one, no one
No onecould be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only cause you're lonely they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile
Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.

Leo Robinson,"Lady, morning's just a moment away, 
And I'm without you once again.
You laughed at me, you said you've never needed me,
I wonder if you need me now.
We played the grams that people play, we made mistakes along the way.
Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me.
Remembering the pain, if I must say, it's deep in my mind and locked away,
But then most of all, I do love you 
Still.
 
Those memories, times I'm sure we'll never forget,
Those feelings we can't put aside.
For what we had, sometimes I try to understand, 
But it's so heavy on my mind.
So many dreams that flew away, so many words we didn't say.
Two people lost in a storm, where did we go, where'd we go?
Lost what we both had found, you know we let each other down.
But then most of all, I do love you
Still.
 
We played the games that people play, 
We made mistakes along the way.
Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me.
Cause I needed you so desperately.
We were too blind to see, but then,
Most of all, I do love you",Still
Leo Robinson,"Thanks for the times that you've given me,
The memories are all in mind.
And now that we've come
To the end of our rainbow
There's something I must say out loud!

Your once, twice
Three times a lady
And I love you.
Yes, your once, twice
Three times a lady
And I love you!

When we are together
The moments I cherish
With every beat of my heart.
To touch you, to hold you
To feel you, to need you.
There's nothing to keep us apart
You're once, twice
Three times a lady
And I love you!

Leo Sayer,"Used to see him hanging around everywhere
In a world of his own
See him hanging round street corners where
We would meet
He was a lonely kid
Now they tell us that he's moved on
Aint been seen for so long
Don't know here he's gone
It's been so long, but I'm on the road
And though it ain't been easy
At least I made it on my own
My tongue's been tied for far too long
And now your gonna hear me
At least I now where I belong
S.O.L.O. I'm on the road
Hello hello, I'm on my own
Ah y'see everybody's got someone
To lay their troubled lives upon
I'm really glad I've only got my own
Once upon a time, well I had lots of friends
I moved freely through their lives
But two's a couple and, well three's a crowd
I was just left out
Hanging around
I've had as much now as I can take
There ain't no need to stay
S.O.L.O. I'm on the road
Hello hello, I'm all alone
Ah yes everybody smiles at me

Leo Sayer,"Magdalena sits in her chair
Speaking on the mass
She talks in splice and splinters
She laughs not breaking glass

She says that she would have me
Spirit her away
Stealing all my images
Till there's nothin' left to say

Oh, Magdalena
Nothing like the saint you are
Your love is like a razor
My heart is just a scar

Oh, Magdalena
Nothing like the saint you are

She tells me that she wants me
Then she tells me not to bother
She tells me that I couldn't hold
A candle to her father

She knows that she's got me
When I start to rave about
She'll just smile and flash her eyes
And blow the candle out

Oh, Magdalena
Oh, Magdalena
Nothing like the saint you are

Magdalena lying there
Could make a dancer stumble
Make a preacher bite his tongue
And leave him with a mumble

And if you think I'm crazy, babe
Or that I'm kiddin' you
Just pay your dues and lose your blues
When she gets her tongue in you

Oh, Magdalena
Nothing like the saint you are
Your love is like a razor
My heart is just a scar

Oh, Magdalena
Nothing like the saint you are

Well, I can't be forgotten and I can't be ignored
You find me with my poems and my songs
But if upon your journey, you're returning to L.A.
Won't you take this little red-haired girl along?

Oh, Magdalena
Nothing like a saint you are
Your love is like a razor
My heart is just a scar

Oh, Magdalena
Nothing like a saint you are

Now if I appear to be carefree, 
it's only to camouflage my sadness
in order to shield my pride 
I try to cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But Don't let my show convince you 
that I've been happy since you decided to go,
I need you so, I'm hurt and I want you to know
but for others I put on a show

smiling in the public eye
but in my lonely room I cry

Don't let my glad expression
Give you a wrong impression

In a pile outside the door
I tried and tried, but I just can't remember
What they're for

The world outside is tugging
Like a beggar at my sleep
Ah, that's much too old
A story to believe

And you know
That it's taken it's share of me
Even though
You take such good care of me

Now, you say Morocco
And that makes me smile
I haven't seen Morocco
For a long, long while

The dreams are rolling down
Across the places in my mind
And I've just had
A taste of something fine

The future hides and the past just slides
England lies between
Floating in a silver mist
So cold and so clean

And California's shaking
Like some angry child will
Who has asked for love
And isn't answered still

And you know
That I'm looking back carefully
'Cause I know
That there's still something there for me

But you said Morocco
And it made me smile
And it hasn't been that easy
For a long, long while

And looking back into your eyes
I saw them really shine
Giving me a taste
Of something fine, something fine

Now, if you see Morocco
I know you'll go in style
I may not see Morocco
For a little while

But while you're there
I was hoping you might keep it in your mind
To save me just a taste
Of something fine

I just had to make you mine
Felt so sad when you told me
About your troubled life, all about your troubled life

I've a feelin' what we really need right now, girl

Looking vacant in the neon lights
Who need the truth when you can live a lie
Can't stop now it's too late

He dies alone

Leo Sayer,"He sees her at the same time every night 
At the Mexican discotheque 
She gives him french kisses 
He gives her french cigarettes 
They sit at the same table every time 
The lights are low 
But their eyes shine 
Just digging the music 
From those sweet soul bands 

She keeps him outta fights 
Holds on to his hand 
He whispers slowly ""tonight's the night"" 
Months of planning so it's gotta be right 
Under the table her bag is busting at the seams 
She made sure to bring everything

Moonlighting they're losing all their friends 
Moonlighting it's the only way 
It's frightening but it means they'll stay 
Together they're gonna make it together 

His blue Morris van is parked in an alley 
Just by Montague street 
His friend Eddie he did the respray 
So he couldn't drive it all last week 
And it cost most of the money 
That he had saved up 
To pay Eddie's receipt 
But he figures it's worth it 
Cause the disguise is a must 
When they go missing 
They're gonna look for the van first 
She whispers slowly ""it'll be alright"" 
I took some cash from my building society 
And my monthly check came in just right 
If only they knew they weren't giving it away 

9:15 Monday morning at the printing works 
The boss notices someone's not clocked in 
And the water department 
Of the council offices has a message 
That Mrs. Park's daughter is missing 
Meanwhile the Carlisle turnoff of the m6 motorway 
Drinking cold black coffee eating hot cup cakes 
She stares at him with his beard unshaved 
Wonders at his powers of staying awake 
He whispers slowly ""you did just fine"" 
They shared the driving all through the night 
She laughs ""my mother will have lost her mind

They're three hundred behind",Moonlighting

Leo Sayer,"I feel so lost and lonely
Standing by the river Seine
I don't know how I got here or why I came
But everywhere I see her smiling face
I remember
We met somewhere in the back streets
In this city of another age
And talking broken English 'til the darkness came
And in my room she called me by my name
And she whispered
Paris dies in the morning
That's something that they never say
They never tell you
Paris dies in the morning light
You'd never think it late at night, no, no
It disappears in the sunshine
It's something that they never say
They never tell you
Paris dies in the morning light
It's always gonna be that way
When we made love in that hotel
Like I never made before
Thought I could die
When she whispered slow
Marai toujours
She was wild and enchanting
The night was like a dream
We danced and sang the
Sweetest harmony
The words come back so clear
I remember when we sang
Paris dies in the morning
That's something that they never say
They never tell you
Paris dies in the morning light
You'd never think it late at night, no, no
[Solo]
When I awoke in the morning
She was nowhere to be found
That's why I'm standing
Waiting a t this river's edge
I know we'll never meet again
It was true when she said
Paris dies in the morning
(It ends this way)
The moment when it steals your heart
And then it loves you
Paris dies I the morning light
You'd never think it late at night, no no
She disappeared in the morning light
She said that it would end this way
Did not believe her
Paris dies in the morning light
I know we'll never meet again

I know we'll never meet again
She's gone

Half awake and half asleep
Have you ever laid there thinking
Was it all a dream?
But you reach out and she's there
Every moment, everywhere
Have you ever been in love?

Have you ever felt
How far a heart can fall
Have you ever stayed up waiting
For a telephone call
Just to hear her say hello
'Cause you miss each other so
Have you ever been in love?

Have there been times to laugh
And times you really want to cry
Finding reasons to believe her
'Cause you'd die a little if she lied
And when in times of doubt
Have you ever tried to work it out
But still she leaves you wondering
What it's all about

And when she's far away
Have you ever felt the need to stray
And tried and then discovered
It just doesn't pay
'Cause with her, you can be true
And with her, you can be you
Have you ever been in love?

Have there been times to laugh
And times you really want to cry
Finding reasons to believe her
'Cause you'd die a little if she lied
And when in times of doubt
Have you ever tried to work it out
But still she leaves you wondering
What it's all about

And when the night comes down
Can you call your house a home
Do you dream you're still together
And wake up alone

Is it alright with you
I don't know what to say
It'll be like a holiday

When you say you're all alone
Makes me wanna come back
And this house is not a home
I just gotta go back

Its twelve ten when I put down the phone
The moons shining down on orchard road
And I'm feeling like a schoolboy again and tonight
Ill see you in my dreams of orchard road

Its funny but I thought I'd never go back
I think sometimes I might loose track
But I remember you and the things we do
And I want it back.

In orchard road you've got my heart
I left it in your doorway
In orchard road a welcome back
Is waiting there just for me
In orchard road the sun will shine
Again I know I know
In orchard road you keep my love

Trapped in a world
That's a distorted reality

Happiness you took from me
And left me all alone
With only memories

Through the mirror of my mind
Through all these tears that I'm crying
Reflects a hurt I can't control
Although you're gone
I keep holding on
To those happy times
Oh, girl when you were mine

As I peer through the windows
Of lost time
Keeping looking over my yesterdays
And all the love I gave all in vain
(All the love) All the love
That I've wasted
(All the tears) All the tears
That I've tasted
All in vain

Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream that's lost
From the hurt baby
That you have caused

Everywhere I turn
Seems like everything I see
Reflects a hurt I can't control

In you I put
All my hope and trust
Right before my eyes
My whole world has turned to dust

To look for love 
I just don't know how 
Oh girl 
How I depend on you 
To give me love when I need it 
Right on time 
You would always be there 

[Chorus]
All my friends call me a fool 
They say 
Let the woman take care of you 
So I 
Try to be hip and think like the crowd 
But not even the crowd 
Will help me now 

Oh girl 
Tell me what am I gonna do? 
Cause I know I got 
Such a guilty face 
Girl, I feel so out of place 

[Chorus]

Oh girl 
I guess I'll never know 
I could save myself 
A lot of useless tears 
Girl, I've gotta get away from here 
Oh girl 
Pain will double if you leave me now 
Cause I don't know where 
To look for love 
And I just don't know how",Oh Girl

Over the shadows and the rain

León Benavente,"Un día me eché a las calles dispuesto a cambiar de vida
Me había visto en el espejo y no me reconocía
""¿Podría estudiar otra vez?"" me dije ""Filosofía""
Quizá me conozca mejor y encuentre alguna salida
Así que dejé mi trabajo
Dejé pareja e hijos
Vendí mi coche, quemé mi ropa, fundí mi oro
Ahora lo entiendo todo
Ahora soy feliz
Siento una extraña euforia
Ahora soy feliz
Esto sí que es la gloria
Tan pronto se hizo de noche, entré en el bar de la esquina
Te vi con una compañera de mi antigua oficina
""¿Tú crees que estoy loca?"" me dijo mientras reía
Y una pequeña lágrima se escurrió por mi mejilla

Entonces fuimos a su casa
Hicimos lo que hacen los perros
Lamiéndonos las heridas
Justo después de corrernos
Fue como subir a una noria
Ahora soy feliz
Siento una extraña euforia
Ahora soy feliz
Esto sí que es la gloria
De allí salí dispuesto a destruir la mañana
En busca de gente que me explicara qué pasa en España
¿Por qué nos corroe la envidia?
¿A santo de qué tanta fiesta?
¿Por qué se intenta evitar todo lo que molesta?
Entonces pensé en el fútbol
En la democracia y la siesta

Y en lo que distingue a una persona de una bestia
Tengo la cara que me merezco
Tengo el país que me merezco
Y ahora soy feliz
Siento una extraña euforia
Ahora soy feliz
Esto sí que es la gloria
Hoy era un día para empezar
Desde cero
Hoy era un buen día para hacer un balance completo
Hoy bien podría haber cambiado
Mi destino
Pero lo único que he hecho es emborracharme y ser un cretino
Es una triste historia
Y ahora soy feliz
Siento una extraña euforia
Ahora soy feliz

Al menos nuca para hacer este trabajo
Ahora hay dos taxis en la esquina para hacernos olvidar

Nuestra casa, la rutina y nuestro miedo a volar

De camino al aeropuerto alguien empieza a toser
Se queja de que en los aviones no se puede comer
Es temprano y en la radio se da a conocer
Al que estampó su coche en la sede del PP

Una vez más sin saber qué nos va a pasar
Algo se aproxima pero no sabemos qué
Edu se toma un café con toda tranquilidad
Y hablamos del futuro y la partenidad

Y justo al sobrevolar los Cayos de florida
Empezamos a pensar cómo a cambiado nuestra vida
Al fin y al cabo los aviones no están mal
Siempre que tengas a mano vino y Orfidal

Tras veinte horas de sol, vamos a aterrizar
Desde el cielo el D.F es descomunal
La gente aplaude las hazañas del piloto al posar
Semejante bicho en medio de la cuidad

Y a César le han retenido en el control de inmigración
Se asusta cuando va llegar dos tipos de la Interpol
Saben su vida y él empieza a temblar
Comprueban que era un error y le dejan marchar

El aire pesa como el plomo y nos cuesta respirar
Lo notamos justo cuando salimos a fumar
Ahora nos lleva una van a la Colonia Roma

""En estos baches pueden ver la corrupcción
Esto sólo se arregla con otra revolución""
En el hotel hay bienvenida con tequila y mezcal
Y unos chicos esperando una banda de metal

Una cama gigante, mil posturas posibles
Una biblia en la mesa, un par de crucifijos
Y en la puerta Saturno devorando a sus hijos

Y ahora oigo a Luis hablar con España
Allí es invierno y su novia le extraña
Yo me pego una ducha y me quedo tranquilo
Y pienso en cenar y dormir contigo

Y en un cuaderno escribo lo que ha pasado
Y palabras que han cambiado de significado
Contrato, amigo, dinero, edad, música
Trabajo, ego, vanidad

¡Por dios, si acabamos de llegar!
Uno se pone a reír, otro a organizar
A veces pienso que esto no lo vamos a aguantar
Y tras dos tequilas y otros dos mezcales
Empezamos a hablar sobre las multinacionales
Y salen cifras y porcentajes, estamos muy tensos, no hay quien se relaje

¿Y que queréis saber sobre las canciones?
Si estan bien hechas, no hacen falta explicaciones
¿Y a quién le importa nuestra opinión
Sobre el amor, la política o la secesión?
Y de vuelta al hotel escucho a Kozelek
Y pienso en una canción que podríamos hacer
Algo que sea real, totalmente real
Estos días recorriendo el Distrito Federal

Y entro a comprar un disco de Juan Cicerol
Y me dicen que recién, recién se les agotó
Y eso me hace feliz y me pongo a gritar
Ese tipo es el puto nuevo Johnny Cash

Y pienso en cuando nos dicen que aprovechemos
Que no sabemos cuánto duraremos
Enciendo el televisor cansado de esta jornada
56 canales en los que no hay nunca nada

Te llamé mientras despertabas
Y me dijiste: ""La vida nunca es lo que imaginabas""
Sé que tienes razon, sueles tener razón
Pero sigo sin llegar a una conclusión
Otro día de promo, de prisas y atascos
De gente que tarda en llegar a su trabajo
¿Y que tendrá lo que digamos de relevante?
Mejor leer a Gragera, a Tiqqun o a Carver

Y otra vez el vacío y la soledad
Y otro taxi que nos lleve a toda velocidad
A volver a beber y a bailar rocanrol
Y llamar a un contacto que nos haga un favor
¿Y qué nos puede quedar, a decir verdad?
Ya tendremos tiempo para descansar
Y por ahora es todo lo que os puedo contar
Quizá en un par de años pueda continuar",Habitación 615
León Benavente,"No es que hayamos aprendido mucho de un tiempo a esta parte
Es casi imposible dar un paso sin hacerse daño
El único estado natural parece ser la guerra
Busquemos otro lugar al que poder huir
Ahá, nuevas tierras
Ahá, nuevas tierras
¿Cómo es que decís que ha llegado el siglo xxi
Si aquí no hemos notado nada en especial?
Quizá un poco más de polvo en nuestros hombros
Busquemos otro lugar al que poder huir
Busquemos un nuevo lugar para destruir

León Gieco,"Bajaste del norte

Volvías a encontrar

No tengo cuerpo ni me sopla el viento 
Para el arregla calles quizás no molesto 
Solo tengo adentro, soy un pobre agujero

We can solve it there, baby

Hey, it's a family affair, baby
And we can work it out, yeah
We don't need no help from strangers

Hey, they're outside looking in, baby

We won't seek no help from strangers
'Cause that would add to the problem, baby ooh

It's gonna be alright
Keep your head up to the sky
[Z-Ro] Cause everything's gon' be alright

[Z-Ro]
Too many problems in my life I find myself unable to maintain
The nigga that was takin over my brain
Redesignin my main frame
Developin so much hatred I feel like fuck all of y'all
And for the slightest disrespect I would gladly touch all of y'all
Dedicated to doing bad and addicted to drama
People think I'm missin manners at home training but I'm just missin my momma
It's like I don't fit in this bullshit world
Surrounded by bullshit boys and bullshit bitches
Better murder they own people before they come up
And that's why I be mean muggin every son of a bitch that walk or run up
I'm paranoid my nigga, I keep one in the chamber
Willing to trade my freedom for life and live among strangers
My goal is to become one hundred and ten years old
I found myself but I can't grow until I find my soul
Stuck on 25 but hopefully I'll survive, I'll make it
Receiving hard pain from L.O.V.E., but I'll take it

[Chorus x2]

[Z-Ro]
Dear Cookie I know you looking at ya son from heaven
Totally clean and blessed without ???, drugs, and weapons
Wish I could open up the pearly gates and see your face
But I gotta sinful life momma and I may not get to see that place
I just can't keep my cool, mother fuckers messin with the wrong weapon
I pull out my Jimmy Bone switchblade and start cuttin'
Nigga you ain't never known pain, you don't want this in your ??? vein
Rusty blades make aim cream spread like mayonnaise magn
I can't think of nothin' that ever made me feel like that dro
Not even a woman, cause as quick as she comes she out the do'
Can't put my trust up in Eve, cause she got tricks up her sleeve
All I want to do is live until I'm D.E.A.D.
Of natural causes I don't need nobody knockin' me off
Just let me fall bitch get out the way you blockin' me off
Stuck in the same spot but hopefully I'll survive, I'll make it
Disrespected by the people I love, but I'll take it

You can read through the papers won't say nothing at all
'Cause my love is secret
And it's getting harder to keep it
But I'll wait my time
Before I put my heart on the line
So no TV broadcast no overhead sign
That's not the way you'll find out 'bout this love of mine
You won't know how you know it but you're gonna know it
All in good time

So many ways to communicate
Tell me why, why do I hesitate
The words they get stuck in my mouth
It's up to you to read between the lines
Move closer baby just read the signs
But please make it soon

So maybe this Winter or when Spring has arrived
There'll come a day when this love I can no longer hide
But you're gonna know it I'll make sure that you know it 
All in good time

Please don't you look fo no message on your internet line 
All you need to know is right here in this heart of mine

Leon Jackson,"Many nights we've prayed
With no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful song
We barely understood

Now we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains long
Before we knew we could

There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill

Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe
Somehow you will
You will when you believe

Easy to despair
When all you hear is fear and lies
Easy just to run and hide
Too frightened to begin

But if we dare to dare
Don't wait for answers from the skies
Each of us can look inside
And hear this song within

There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill

Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe
Somehow you will
You will when you believe

They don't always happen when you ask
And it's easy to give in to your fear
But when your blinded by your faith
Can't see your way clear through the rain
A small, but still resilient voice
Says hope is very near, ohh

There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill

Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe
Somehow you will
(Now you will)
And now you will

You will, when you believe
You will, when you believe

With a corn cob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

He was made of snow
But the children know how he came to life one day
There must of been some magic in
That ol' silk hat they found
But when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

So he said lets run and we'll have some fun before I melt away
Down to the village with a broom stick in his hand
Runnin' here and there all around the square
Sayin' catch me if you can

He led them down the streets of town
Right to that traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler stop

But he waved goodbye sayin' don't you cry
I'll be back again some day

We'll soon be together on the bayou sundown
We'll jaw jambalaya, and sing all night long

From Lake Charles to see me at Pontchartrain
But my heart beats slower when she not around
The best things in life not the same

Sometimes I get lonely and I'm hurtin' inside
When my Alice can't understand
Like a dancer I saw in New Orlean' one time
She makes me feel just like a man

sometime seem tomorrow'd never come
but we couldn't keep together
for all the times we tried
we had a sad reunion tonight

Oh how we laughed together
trapped in the grapes of wrath together
yes and we loved each other
Me and Baby Jane
but now she's gone forever
Lord help me stay together
see her vacant eyes and a needle in a vain
Oh baby, baby, Baby Jane

I see the purple mountains
I'm lost and inbetween
a place that I know well and in a bad dream
Others stand beside me too late to try and find
exscuses in the face of being blind
but now she is awaiting for the feeling of the cold
to free her from the nightmare of old
she was a part of me silently alone 
and too far down to draw the line

Oh how we laughed together
trapped in the grapes of wrath together
yes and we loved each other

Was callous to Queenie with his rude side

Queenie's right across, running to the floor
Now he knows better than to mate

And I guess he tried most ever' thing low down
He was out tomcattin' one night when he started a great big fight

But at the railroad station they took him by the arm

He's in the jailhouse now, he's in the jailhouse now
Oh yes, he broke out and all over town the fool walked about
He's in the jailhouse now

Then I met Bill's old gal Sadie and she said
""Have you seen my baby?""
And I told her he was down town in the can
Litlle Sadie she started fussin'
She went down to the jailhouse a-cussin'
She says, ""I come down here to get my man""

She's in the jailhouse now, she's in the jailhouse now
So you can understand why little old Sadie got throwed in the can
She's in the jailhouse now

I went out last Tuesday, met a sweet little gal named Suzie
I'd say she was the sweetest thing around
She started to callin' me honey and we began to spent my money

A little place called Hamburger Dan
I heard that old jukebox started playin'
THe song about a 'Truck Drivin' Man'

Well the waitress then brought me some coffee
And I thanked her and called her again
I said, ""That old song there sure does fit me
'Cause I'm a truck drivin' man""

So pour me another cup of coffee
For it is the best in the land
And put another nickel in the jukebox
And play that 'Truck Drivin' Man'

And I climbed back aboard my old semi
Again like a flash I was gone
I heard them old truck wheels start rollin'
I'm on my way down to San Antone

Oh so, pour me another cup of coffee

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?

Leon Russell,"Try and judge me only by my time and changes
And not mistaken words, for I say many
Listen only to my song and watch my eyes
There's not much time to spill, there's hardly any

Well, look at all the children living in the streets
And they're looking, not afraid to touch each other
They're not afraid to be themselves or someone else
Or choose their friends with love and not by color

Never treat a brother like a passing stranger
Honey, won't you always try to keep the love light burning
Sing a song of love and open up your heart
For you might be the prince of peace returning
Yeah, you might be the prince of peace returning

Oh, the love the blind and wounded as that you would yourself
And the businessmen in cells collecting pennies
Judge their wealth by coins that they give away
And not the ones that they keep for themselves for spending

Oh, never be impatient with the ones who love you
It might be yourself that you're burning
Sing a song of love and open up your heart
For you might be the prince of peace returning

Never treat a brother like a passing stranger
Honey, won't you always try to keep the love light burning
Sing a song of love and open up your heart
For you might be the prince of peace returning

If I pray to your Jesus then you gonna tell us what you're about to do?
What if I pay me and I might pay you

How many days until I die

With the burrow in the palace of the king

With mythology and astrology
Has got some words to say
About the way we live today
Why can't we learn to love each other
It's time to turn a new face
To the whole world wide human race

Stop the money chase
Lay back, relax
Get back on the human track
Stop racing toward oblivion

When you hear them ring

Tumbleweeds around me sing their lonely song.
Nights underneath the prairie moon,
I ride along and sing this tune.

Lonely but free I'll be found
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds.

Cares of the past are behind
Nowhere to go but I'll find
Just where the trail will wind
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds.

That a new world's born at dawn.

But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.

And stay by my side until morning is nigh.

Close by me forever, and love me, I pray.

Leon Russell,"Gather round me people, got a song to sing
About that sweet magnolia thyme
The black eyed Susan made some catfish stew
And papa brought some homemade wine

Now, all the southern children like to rock 'n' roll
The TV mamas tell you why
They got it on the boat from Africa
It's that Dixie lullaby

And blind Willie Time, he had a dime shoe shine
Stand down on Beale Street
And Willie would stop and say ""Hello""
To all the shoes he'd meet

""Why are you so happy?"" said the clean white buck
""You got no reason to be happy Mr. Time""
But Willie just smiled and he dropped his rag
And sang a Dixie lullaby

Now you heard the story of my southern home
With a honeysuckle wine
Anytime you think that you might come yourself
You ought to keep this thought in mind

All you easy riders better watch your step
If you're walkin' down below the line
That Louisiana man is gonna get you, yet
With his Dixie lullaby

He's got a Dixie lullaby
Ohh, it's a Dixie lullaby, bye

With a girl I saw on a bar room t.v. screen

Well I was just gettin ready to get my hat
When she caught my eye and I put it back
And I ordered myself a couple o more shots and beers

Round and round, oh round and round
The meanest hunk o woman
That anybody ever seen
Down in the arena

She was five foot six and two fifteen
A bleached-blonde mama
With a streak of mean
She knew how to knuckle
And she knew how to scuffle and fight

And the roller derby program said
That she was built like a fridgerator with a head
Her fans call her tuffy
But all her buddies called her spike

But to fall in love
With this heavy-duty woman
I been speakin of
Things looked kind of bad
Until the day she skated into my life

Well she might be nasty
She might be fat
But I never met a person
Who would tell her that
Shes my big blonde bomber
My heavy handed hackensack mama

I'd be so lost if you went away
There'd be a thousand hours in the day

Because of one caress my world was overturned

By my flaming heart you'd never leave me, would you?
You couldn't hurt me, could you?

Leon Ware,"Outside the sky is water color grey
Newspaper says to look for rain today
No one around for company
And so I turn to memories to pass the time away
Each face that flashes back to mind
Seems as it was untouched by time
I can't recall quite all the names
Each one is precious all the same
How strange to think
How many friends were lost somewhere behind

[Chorus]
Where are they now
How I miss those companions
Who walked the canyons of the night
By my side
Where are they now
Like so many crazy dancers
We live only for the answers in a song
But that was long ago
Where are they now
When love was new and wonderful
There was no word impossible
The future we saw with our minds
Was something of our hearts design
Between today and yesterday
Life came between us all

[Chorus: x2]

Where are they now",Where Are They Now
Leon Williams,"Emily, Emily, Emily
Has the murmuring sound of may
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

Say Emily, Emily, Emily
And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

(and we fade to a marvelous view)
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

Is to keep me from falling

And in this world of loneliness

Leona Lewis,"You walked with me
Footprints in the sand
And helped me understand
Where I'm going

You walked with me
When I was all alone
With so much unknown
Along the way

I heard you say
I promise you
I'm always there
When your heart is filled with sorrow
And despair

And I'll carry you
When you need a friend
You'll find my footprints in the sand

I see my life
Flash across the sky
So many times have I
Been so afraid
And just when I
Thought I lost my way
You gave me strength to carry on
Thats when I heard you say

I promise you
I'm always there
When your heart is filled with sorrow and despair

And I'll carry you
When you need a friend
You'll find my footprints in the sand

When I'm weary
Well I know you'll be there
And I can feel you
When you say

I promise you
I'm always there
When your heart is filled with sadness and despair

And I'll carry you
When you need a friend
You'll find my footprints in the sand


When your heart is full of sadness and despair

And I'll carry you
When you need a friend

Leona Lewis,"This is a crazy world
These can be lonely times
It's hard to know who's on your side
Most of the time

Who can you really trust
Who do you really know
Is there anybody out there
Who can make you feel less alone
Sometimes you just can't make it on your own

If you need a place where you can run
If you need a shoulder to cry on
I'll always be your friend

When you need some shelter from the rain
When you need a healer for your pain
I will be there time and time again
When you need someone to love you
Here I am,

If you have broken dreams
Just lay them all on me
I'll be the one who understands
So take my hand

If you reach emptiness
You know I'll do my best
To fill you up with all the love
That I can show someone
I promise you you'll never walk alone

If you need a place where you can run
If you need a shoulder to cry on
I'll always be your friend

When you need some shelter from the rain
When you need a healer for your pain
I will be there time and time again
When you need someone to love you
Here I am,

Everybody needs somebody who
Keep a heart and soul in two

If you need a place where you can run
If you need a shoulder to cry on

When you need a healer for your pain

When you need someone to love you

Nothing I could ever do to make you see
What you mean to me

All the pain, the tears I cried
Still you never said goodbye and now I know
How far you'd go

And if I let you down
I'll turn it all around
This time I'll never let you go

I will be, all that you want
And get myself together
'Cause you keep me from falling apart

All my life, I'll be with you forever
To get you through the day
And make everything OK

I thought that I had everything
I didn't know what life could bring
But now I see, honestly

You're the one thing I got right
The only one I let inside
Now I can breathe, cause you're here with me

If I let you down

I can never, ever live a day without you
Here with me, do you see you're all I need?

Leona Lewis,"How many times
Are you gonna take it
Look in my eyes
Help me make this make sense

Night after night
You sat up and cried
Wondering when you're gonna see things clearer
You don't even realize
That at this very moment
You're talking to yourself in the mirror

It's true

[Chorus]
So you think I'm strong but you're feelin' that you're weak
Baby I'm you
But we're one in the same so you're just as strong as me
Baby I'm you
And we deserve better it's time for us to leave
You know what to do
Cause I'm not a fool
So neither are you
Baby I'm you

Oh you're not crazy
If only you'd realize
That you and I
Have all the help we need

So why are we sitting here on the floor
(listen to me)
We ain't cryin' no more
I am your soul
I am your heart
My strength is yours (Oh my strength is yours)

Baby it's true


[Chorus]

So pick yourself up right now
We've been here too long
We've overstayed it enough
That might have been
It's been a long time gone

So wipe away the tears
Ain't nothing for us here
The time has come to move on

Leona Lewis,"See I try to hide the fact
That I'm am just a fragile individual (so)
I give off this facade that I'm so hard
When in fact I'm far from unbreakable
I'm so afraid to talk and express myself
Keeping all my feelings bottled inside
Of this softer shell that I call my heart
Cause I can't let love back in again

[Bridge]
Oh I wish I knew
Love was cold
Before I believed
Cause I went head on with this storm
Like lightning gone insane

[Chorus]
It's way to late now
There's none left at all
So I guess I should feel fortunate
But I don't feel that way
Love's not in my heart
Cause see love has left me broken
Broken like glass (gla-ha-hass, gla-ha-hass)
Broken like glass (gla-ha-hass, gla-ha-hass)
Broken like glass (gla-ha-hass, gla-ha-hass) (e-e-eah)
So if you see me you can call me,
If you see me you can call me Misses Glass

Now after all the lying to myself I'm
Stuck feeling miserable (memories?)
I had forced myself to be somebody else
Making me seem invisible (Oh just see)
See I'm a lover like any other woman
And sometimes I get emotional
And it might seem hard to understand
Where I'm coming from
And you might never ever know

So if you see me you can call me

So if you see me you can call me
(See love has left me broken like glass)
If you see me you can call me misses glass

People say love
Comes and goes, but
They don't understand
What they don't know
'Cause, what I feel starts
Deep inside
It's kinda like a sea
That springs into life

They say it's not right
And we move too fast
But they don't know the meaning
Of what we have

Wherever it is, I'll fly
Whatever it takes, I'll try
So don't pay no mind
To whatever people say
Whenever it is in my life
Know that I will be on time
'Cause you know why
There's no standing in our way

When you're far and
We're apart
I'm really missing you
I wanna be where you are

They say it's not right (it's not right)
And it won't last (it won't last)
And there's no point believing
What we have

Wherever it is, I'll fly
Whatever it takes, I'll try
So don't pay no mind
To what other people say
Whenever it is in my life
I'll be on time
'Cause you know why
There's no standing in my way

And if you're lost
I'm gonna find you
'Cause without you
I'll break down and cry
And you know why
I wanna surround you

Wherever it is, I'll fly

Still waitin' for mornin' to come
When I see if the sun will rise, in the way that your by my side
Well we got so much in store
Tell me what is it I'm reaching for
When were through building memories ill hold yesterday in my heart
In my heart

They can take tomorrow and the plans we made
They can take the music that we never play
All the broken dreams take everything
Just take it away, but they can never have yesterday
They can take the future that we'll never know
They can take the places that we said we will go
All the broken dreams take everything
Just take it away, but they can never have yesterday

You always choose to stay
I should be thankful for everyday
Heaven knows what the future holds, or least where the story goes
I never believed until now
I know I'll see you again I'm sure
No its not selfish to ask for more
One more night one more day one more smile on your face
But they cant take yesterday

They can take tomorrow and the plans we made
They can take the music that we never play
All the broken dreams take everything
Just take it away, but they can never have yesterday
They can take the future that we'll never know
They can take the places that we said we will go
All the broken dreams take everything
Just take it away, but they can never have yesterday

I thought our days would last forever
But it wasn't our destiny
Cause in my mind we had so much time, but I was so wrong
No I can believe that
I can still find the strength in the moments we made
I'm lookin' back on yesterday

They can take tomorrow and the plans we made
They can take the music that we never play
All the broken dreams take everything
Just take it away, but they can never have yesterday
They can take the future that we'll never know
They can take the places that we said we will go

Just take it away, but they can never have yesterday

I didn't know where to turn to
See somehow I cant forget you
After all that we've been through

Go in, come in thought I heard a knock
Who's there? No one thinking that I deserved it
Now I realize that I really didn't know
You didn't notice, you mean everything
quickly I'm learning, to love again
All I know is, I'ma be okay

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals to
It'll all get better in time
Even though i really love you
I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to
It'll all get better in time

How could I turn on the TV
Without something there to remind me
Was it all that easy to just put aside your feelings

If I'm dreaming
Don't wanna let, hurt my feelings

But thats the path, i believe in
And i know that, time will heal it
You didn't notice, you mean everything

Its time I let you go so I can be free
and live my life how it should be
no matter how hard it is ill be fine without you

Footprints in the sand,
And helped me understand,
Where I'm going

You walked with me,
When I was all alone,
With so much unknown,
Along the way,
Then I heard you say

I promise you,
I'm always there,
When your heart is filled with sorrow,
And despair, I'll carry you
When you need a friend
You'll find my footprints in the sand.

I see my life flash across the sky,
So many times have I been so afraid.
And just when I, have thought I lost my way,
You gave me strength to carry on,
It's then I heard you say

I promise you
I'm always there
When your heart is filled
With sorrow and despair
And, I'll carry you
When you need a friend
You'll find my footprints in the sand.

When I'm with you,
Well I know you've been there,
And I can feel you when you say

I promise you (you)

With sadness and despair (and despair)
I'll carry you when you need a friend (need a friend)

Once or twice was enough, but it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it, you're frozen
But something happened, for the very first time with you

And everyone's looking round, thinking I'm going crazy

But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love

Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that the goal, is to keep me from falling
But nothings greater, than the rush that comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me, thinks that I'm going crazy, maybe, maybe

I don't wanna spend another day,
Pointing fingers while I'm placing blame,
I'm no angel, imperfect myself, 'cause baby I am only human,
And I don't wanna put it all on you,
I admit I did some painful things its true,
And I'm sorry for them, no making amends,
For always thinking I was innocent

Starting today, I'm gonna change,
Don't wanna make the same mistakes,
'cause I can see a new horizon,
The ice around my heart is melting,
And the hurt I feel is slowly dying,
Now I'm, no longer crying,
The bridge we burnt is being built again,
Its leading to a new beginning,
And it may never be the way it was,
And that's because I'm talking about forgiveness,
Forgiveness, forgiveness, forgiveness,

I wish we could take back the things we said,
'cause what we said not always what we ment,
We lost our heads, in the moment,
And the words we used them like a weapon,
But no one wins if we both walk away,
And we hid behind the people we became,
We're warmer than that, we're better than that,
And I still cherish all the things we had,

Starting today, I'm gonna change,
Don't wanna make the same mistakes,
'cause I can see a new horizon,
The ice around my heart is melting,
And the hurt I feel is slowly dying,
Now I'm, no longer crying,
The bridge we burnt is being built again,
Its leading to a new beginning,
And it may never be the way it was,
And that's because I'm talking about forgiveness,
Forgiveness, forgiveness, forgiveness

If everybody could forgive and forget (just forget),
Think of all the time that we could spend, being friends,
Think about all the lives we could change,
And all the love we could make,
Baby how the world would be a better place,
In the end, oh

Starting today, all that we will change,
And ill make the same mistakes, you know that,
I can see a new horizon,
The ice around my heart is melting,
And the hurt I feel is slowly dying,
And I'm no longer,
The bridge we burnt is being built again,
Its leading to a new beginning,
And it may never be the way it was,
And that's because I'm talking about forgiveness,

Then we really have to go
You've been the only thing that's right
In all I've done

And I can barely look at you
But every single time I do
I know we'll make it anywhere
Away from here

Light up, light up
As if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you, dear

To think I might not see those eyes
Makes it so hard not to cry
And as we say our long goodbyes
I nearly do

Light up, light up
As if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you, dear

Louder, louder
And we'll run for our lives
I can hardly speak, I understand
Why you can't raise your voice to say

Leona Lewis,"Started on a summer Sunday
Your pink dress on the setting sun
You were going to Grandma's house, I was too scared to come 

My silly girl, I'm beggin you
Tell me all the things that I want to hear
My silly girl, I'm in love with you

I had to run to catch you, 
You always moved so fast 
With your cute little smile and your silly laugh,
God gave me love at last 

My silly girl, I'm beggin you
Tell me all the things that I want to hear
My silly girl, I'm in love with you

They said just stay away
Right now I wish I had
I'm so in love with you, my silly girl 
They made me go away 
Sometimes life just isn't fair, but I'll be back someday
I hope you'll still be there 

My silly girl, I'm beggin you
Tell me all the things that I want to hear
My silly girl, I'm in love with you

When you're just a silly boy like me, you're always so scared 
Now I'm just out of luck, I wonder if you ever cared

My silly girl, I'm beggin you
Don't stop being a silly girl
My silly girl, I'm in love with you

Right now I wish I had

Leona Lewis,"I breathe, I hear
But I don't believe it
My heart, it beats
But inside I'm freezing
My hands shake
They've lost all their feeling
Nowhere to take
You say that you're leaving
And there's no turning back this time
Gotta stay alive

Where do I go when I'm so alone?
Where do I turn when you are so close?
We try not to crash but we still collide
Tears I've cried, I'll survive
I'm alive

I'm stripped, I'm bare
I'm left here with nothing
I hold the wheel
And know where I'm going
Your face, I see, in every reflection
No time, no space
I've lost all direction
And there's no turning back this time
Gotta stay alive

Where do I go when I'm so alone?
Where do I turn when you are so close?
We try not to crash but we still collide
Tears I've cried, I'll survive
I'm alive

I'm gonna get there someway
Through all the tears that you bring
And any road I can take
Just to get me some place
Where all the stars on my heart
And all the lies in the dark
Disappear in my head

Lights so bright, tonight
Gonna drive them away

Where do I go when I'm so alone?
Where do I turn when you are so close?
We try not to crash but we still collide
Tears I've cried, I'll survive
I'm alive

I'm alive",Alive

You can't fix me, I'm torn apart.

Every time I feel your touch, I'm broken.
Shattered all the pieces of parts.

I'm putting back together my heart, it's broken.

You can take these photographs and watch them fade away.
You can through away all these letters, I don't care about what they say.

why you can't mend me, don't even try.

Just different faces, different names

We were wrong, but we could be right

Why do we say things we can't take back
Why do we miss what we never had
Both of us fell to the ground
The love was so lost, it couldn't be found
Why do you tend to forget whose vain
I'm tired of crying at the sound of your name
Why don't we turn this around, love ain't the enemy
Don't you want to be lost then found
Lost then found, lost then found
Love ain't the enemy
We could be lost then found

Empty glasses on tables, echoes fill these rooms
The memories go where we go, they're like the suitcase that you never lose
If the good lord's eyes upon me
I swear to make things right
Whatever we lost, I know we can find

Why do we say things we can't take back
And why do we miss what we never had
Both of us fell to the ground
The love was so lost, it couldn't be found
Why do you tend to forget whose vain
I'm tired of crying at the sound of your name
Why don't we turn this around, love aint the enemy
Don't you want to be lost then found

No words can come without (lost then found)
Can't stop the rain, I wish you could take it back (lost then found)
But it's too late, it's too late

Why do we say things we can't take back (why do we say)
Why do we miss what we never had
Both of us fell to the ground
The love was so lost, it couldn't be found (it couldn't be found)
Why do you tend to forget whose vain
I'm tired of crying at the sound of your name
Why don't we turn this around, love ain't the enemy
Don't you want to be lost then found (don't you wanna be)
Lost then found, lost then found
Oh, love ain't the enemy
We could be lost then found

No words can come without
Can't stop the rain, I wish you could take it back
But it's too late, it's too late

We could be lost then found",Lost Then Found

So I can finally see your face again
We'll find a way if this wish comes true tonight

Even though I
Never met you
I still miss you
I can feel you in my dreams

When you wake up
Just maybe you'll remember me

And now I believe that this is fate
'Cause baby we belong together
I know everything is gonna be okay
Just as long as we have each other
Through the sunshine and through the rain
I know that it'll last forever
Just last night I stayed up late
And I wrote you a love letter

Tell me am I insane
I set your letter on the window pane
I thought of you as I let it fly away, and away

Even though I
Never met you
I still miss you
I can see you in my dreams

Leona Lewis,"I wake in the morning, tired of sleeping
Get in the shower, and make my bed alone
I put on my makeup, talk into the mirror
Ready for a new day, without you

And I walk steady on my feet
I talk, my voice obeys me
I go out at night, sleep without the lights
And I do all of the things I have to
Keepin' you off my mind
But when I think I'll be alright
I am always wrong, cause

My hands don't wanna start again
My hands, no they don't wanna understand
My hands, they just shake and try to break whatever peace I may find
My hands, they only agree to hold your hands
And they don't wanna be without your hands
And they will not let me go
No they will not let me go

I talk about you now
And go a day without crying
I go out with my friends now
I stay home all alone
And I don't see you everywhere
And I can say your name easily
I laugh a bit louder, without you

And I see different shades now
I'm almost, never, afraid now
But when I think I'll be okay
I am always wrong, cause

My hands don't wanna start again
My hands, no they don't wanna understand
My hands, they just shake and try to break whatever peace I may find
My hands, they only agree to hold your hands
No they don't wanna be without your hands
And they will not let me go
No they will not let me go

Sometimes I'll wake
I see them reaching out for you
Quietly break whatever shields I spent so long building up
I cannot fake, 'cause when they cry I'm unspoken
They miss holding my baby

My hands (my hands)
No they don't wanna understand
They just shake and try to break whatever peace I may find

My hands, your hands, they don't wanna be without your hands
No they will not let me go
No they will not let me go

My hands, no they don't wanna understand
My hands, they just shake and try to break whatever peace I may find

Leona Lewis,"I will lay down next to you
Stay in bed all afternoon
We were birds of a feather
We were always together
And I never will forget
All the little things you said
And that beautiful summer
You used to call me your love bird.

But the time went on
The wind has blown
And I've grown
And I started a feeling
And my wings have been broken

And I can't believe that I would ever want to be set free
But I just can't stay

So your lovebird's flying away
Your lovebird's flying away
'Cause my heart's been stuck in a cage
Gotta sing my song so pretty, dum dum diddy
And I miss you everyday
But there's nothing left to say
Gotta sing my song so pretty, dum dum diddy

I want the world at my feet
Even if it's bittersweet
I wanna stand on my own and
Hold my heart in my own hands
'Cause I've begun to see
That you and me are different breeds
So I gotta believe in,
Gotta get back to grieving

And I can't believe that I would ever want to be set free
But I just can't stay

So your lovebird's flying away
Your lovebird's flying away
'Cause my heart's been stuck in a cage
Gotta sing my song so pretty, dum dum diddy
And I miss you everyday
But there's nothing left to say
Gotta sing my song so pretty, dum dum diddy

And you'll always be a part of me, you made me who I am
But I gotta say, I'm not afraid to test my wing span
'Cause they say if you love something let it go, let it go, let it go
Open up the gate, 'cause your lovebird's flying away

Your lovebird's flying away
'Cause my heart's been stuck in a cage
Gotta sing my song so pretty, dum dum diddy
And I miss you everyday
But there's nothing left to say
Gotta sing my song so pretty, dum dum diddy",Lovebird

And you hold on tighter in the bedroom

But is it lyin' if you know that they don’t want the truth
Is it cheating if you jerk it while she in the room? Realer than RedTube
Now you mad at the screen
We were something together
I wouldn't call it a team, just big trouble and little kindness
When I know the best parts are so behind us
Keep the pride tough, more than bad luck
I ain’t messed up, I’m just wishing what we needed was a less us
I fell in love with the wrong dream
Crying in my arms what’s it all mean?
I used to know those things and flow both wings
Thoughts where never ending and no Nuvaring’s
And we fought for a patent pending on my new jack swing
Cool, calm and collected keep the Kool Moe Dee
Here is hoping you satisfy that like an addict
I had thought we’d never had to do those things

Leona Lewis,"When the snowman brings the snow
Well, he just might like to know
He's put a great big smile
On somebody's face

If you jump into your bed
Quickly cover up your head
Don't you lock the doors
You know that sweet Santa Claus is on the way

Well, I wish it could be Christmas everyday
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play
Oh, I wish it could be Christmas everyday
Let the bells ring out for Christmas

When we're skating in the park
If the storm cloud makes it dark
Then your rosy cheeks are gonna light
My merry way

Now the frosticals appeared
And they've frozen up my hair
And so we'll lie by the fire
Till the sleep simply melts them all away

Well, I wish it could be Christmas everyday
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play
Oh, I wish it could be Christmas everyday
Let the bells ring out for Christmas

When the snowman brings the snow
He just might like to know
He's put a great big smile
On somebody's face

So if Santa brings that sleigh
All around the Milky Way
I'll sign my name on the rooftop in the snow
Then he may decide to stay

Well, I wish it could be Christmas everyday
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play
Oh, I wish it could be Christmas everyday
Let the bells ring out for Christmas

I wish it could be Christmas everyday
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play

Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt it's worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees

My baby's coming home for Christmas
I've been up all night inside my bedroom
He said he'll be with me real soon

So I wait
And I wait
But I've had as much as I can take

'Cause I've got 5 more nights of sleeping on my own
4 more days until you're coming home
3 more dreams of you and mistletoe
2 more reasons why I love you so
I've got 5 more nights until you're next to me
4 more days of being lonely
3 more wishes I can barely breathe

One more sleep
(Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep
(One more sleep until it's Christmas)

A cold and lonelier December
And I find myself singing at the window
Wondering when you're gonna get back home

So I try
And I try
But there is nothing I can do to pass this time

4 more days until you're coming home
3 more dreams of you and mistletoe

Here to stay is the new bird

As we go along

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, ""are you married?""
We'll say, ""no, man!""
But you can do the job when you're in town""

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we made

Only called when I needed help
If I've only thought of myself
Couldn't find the words to say what I felt
If I've ever lied to your face
Shut you out to keep you away, oh
You'd always give and I'd always take
Yes, it took some time for me to say

Thank you, thank you
For seeing the best and the worst of me
The angel underneath, thank you

When I had trouble finding my way
You showed me I am not my mistakes, no
And that dreams are meant to be lived, not to be chased
And our hearts get stronger after they break

So thank you, thank you
For seeing the best and the worst of me
The angel underneath, thank you

'Cause I wouldn't be here without you
How could I ever doubt you
Slamming doors didn't stop you
Oh, you made me face up to
I wouldn't be here without you
How could I ever doubt you
I was running wild, a reckless child
I'm sorry if I let you down
If I ever put you through hell
Only called when I needed help
Yes, it took some time for me to see

Thank you, thank you
For seeing the best and the worst of me

designed to bleed you grieve you 
and the dark nights proceed through 

He has a mean, mean way don't listen to his 
heart what to say 
Goes to the river, crosses the bridge 
Leaves his possessions, if they don't come with

No one belongs to me

So,
Come come come come
Run run run run
You know it ain't much fun
Chasing after you hon
So forget about you and me
The remains are too delicate to see
And I only wanted to hear your name

Dance through my window
Like sun stretched across my bed

Pull me away
You keep on pulling me away

Come come come come
Run run run run
It's more dizzy than fun
Chasing after the warmth of the sun

And I know I will survive
What don't kill you only makes you more alive
And I hate to hear them say
Time will heal you
Steal you from fear
To ever love again

Look for you in mountains of oceans across the sea
Though we live under the same moon
Catch you in the glimmer of my spoon

Could you be where love raised his head
Where my youth was gallantly led
And where the sun took a holiday
Fell in love, decided to stay

I'm so tired and down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

Could you be where my best friend plays
Where the nights bleed longer then the days
Where I lost my only child
Where the're no trees but wolves run wild

Maybe somewhere I've never seen
Tangier's or the banks of Berlin
Strangers they can veil a friendly eye
Rather be with you than a lie

I'm so tired and down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

When he sings willows begin to weep

Sit here all morning, try to figure this dream out

And a little old cherry on the icing for me

Walk into the room, talk to everyone but you
Slide in close like a wanted ghost

I promise I will let you know

Can I take you home? Maybe take you out

We can drink some more

Leonard,"My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

There 'neath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon

The moon descended
And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone
But the melody lingers on",The Song Is Ended

Stay another memory, 
Stay another great expectation, 
Stay another late movie.

Stay another spin of the bottle. 
Stay another night of holding on, 
Stay another sweet inspiration, 
Stay another love song.",Stay

Leonard Cohen,"I believe that you heard your master sing 
When I was sick in bed. 
I suppose that he told you everything 
That I keep locked away in my head. 
Your master took you traveling, 
Well at least that's what you said. 
And now do you come back to bring 
Your prisoner wine and bread? 

You met him at some temple, where 
They take your clothes at the door. 
He was just a numberless man in a chair 
Who'd just come back from the war. 
And you wrap up his tired face in your hair 
And he hands you the apple core. 
Then he touches your lips now so suddenly bare 
Of all the kisses we put on some time before. 

And he gave you a German Shepherd to walk 
With a collar of leather and nails, 
And he never once made you explain or talk 
About all of the little details, 
Such as who had a word and who had a rock, 
And who had you through the mails. 
Now your love is a secret all over the block, 
And it never stops not even when your master fails. 

And he took you up in his aeroplane, 
Which he flew without any hands, 
And you cruised above the ribbons of rain 
That drove the crowd from the stands. 
Then he killed the lights in a lonely Lane 
And, an ape with angel glands, 
Erased the final wisps of pain 
With the music of rubber bands. 

And now I hear your master sing, 
You kneel for him to come. 
His body is a golden string 
That your body is hanging from. 
His body is a golden string, 
My body has grown numb. 
Oh now you hear your master sing, 
Your shirt is all undone. 

And will you kneel beside this bed 
That we polished so long ago, 
Before your master chose instead 
To make my bed of snow? 
Your eyes are wild and your knuckles are red 
And you're speaking far too low. 
No I can't make out what your master said 
Before he made you go. 

Then I think you're playing far too rough 
For a lady who's been to the moon; 
I've lain by this window long enough 
To get used to an empty room. 
And your love is some dust in an old man's cough 
Who is tapping his foot to a tune, 
And your thighs are a ruin, you want too much, 
Let's say you came back some time too soon. 

I loved your master perfectly 
I taught him all that he knew. 
He was starving in some deep mystery 
Like a man who is sure what is true. 
And I sent you to him with my guarantee 
I could teach him something new, 
And I taught him how you would long for me 
No matter what he said no matter what you'd do. 

I believe that you heard your master sing 
While I was sick in bed, 
I'm sure that he told you everything 
I must keep locked away in my head. 
Your master took you travelling, 
Well at least that's what you said, 
And now do you come back to bring

Leonard Cohen,"The stories of the street are mine, the Spanish voices laugh.
The Cadillacs go creeping now through the night and the poison gas,
And I lean from my window sill in this old hotel I chose,
Yes one hand on my suicide, one hand on the rose.

I know you've heard it's over now and war must surely come,
The cities they are broke in half and the middle men are gone.
But let me ask you one more time, O children of the dusk,
All these hunters who are shrieking now oh do they speak for us?
And where do all these highways go, now that we are free?
Why are the armies marching still that were coming home to me?

O lady with your legs so fine O stranger at your wheel,
You are locked into your suffering and your pleasures are the seal.
The age of lust is giving birth, and both the parents ask
The nurse to tell them fairy tales on both sides of the glass.
And now the infant with his cord is hauled in like a kite,
And one eye filled with blueprints, one eye filled with night.

O come with me my little one, we will find that farm
And grow us grass and apples there and keep all the animals warm.
And if by chance I wake at night and I ask you who I am,
O take me to the slaughterhouse, I will wait there with the lamb.
With one hand on the hexagram and one hand on the girl
I balance on a wishing well that all men call the world.

We are so small between the stars, so large against the sky,
And lost among the subway crowds I try to catch your eye.",Stories of the Street
Leonard Cohen,"It's true that all the men you knew were dealers
Who said they were through with dealing
Every time you gave them shelter
I know that kind of man, it's hard to hold the hand of anyone
Who is reaching for the sky just to surrender
Who is reaching for the sky just to surrender

And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind
You find he did not leave you very much, not even laughter
Like any dealer he was watching for the card that is so high and wild
He'll never need to deal another
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger

And then leaning on your window sill
He'll say one day you caused his will
To weaken with your love and warmth and shelter
And then taking from his wallet
An old schedule of trains, he'll say
I told you when I came I was a stranger

But now another stranger seems
To want you to ignore his dreams
As though they were the burden of some other
Oh, you've seen that man before
His golden arm dispatching cards
But now it's rusted from the elbows to the finger
And he wants to trade the game he plays for shelter
Yes, he wants to trade the game he knows for shelter

Ah, you hate to see another tired man
Lay down his hand like he was giving up the holy game of poker
And while he talks his dreams to sleep you notice there's a highway
That is curling up like smoke above his shoulder
It's curling just like smoke above his shoulder

You tell him to come in sit down
But something makes you turn around
The door is open you can't close your shelter
You try the handle of the road, it opens, do not be afraid
It's you my love, you who are the stranger
It is you my love, you who are the stranger

Well, I've been waiting, I was sure
We'd meet between the trains we're waiting for
I think it's time to board another
Please understand, I never had a secret chart
To get me to the heart of this or any other matter
Well, he talks like this you don't know what he's after
When he speaks like this you don't know what he's after

Let's meet tomorrow if you choose
Upon the shore, beneath the bridge
That they are building on some endless river
Then he leaves the platform for the sleeping car that's warm
You realize, he's only advertising one more shelter
And it comes to you, he never was a stranger
And you say okay, the bridge or someplace later

And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind
You find he did not leave you very much, not even laughter
Like any dealer he was watching for the card that is so high and wild
He'll never need to deal another
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger

And then leaning on your window sill
He'll say one day you caused his will
To weaken with your love and warmth and shelter
And then taking from his wallet
An old schedule of trains, he'll say
I told you when I came I was a stranger
I told you when I came I was a stranger
I told you when I came I was a stranger
I told you when I came I was a stranger",The Stranger Song
Leonard Cohen,"I met a woman long ago
Her hair the black that black can go,
Are you a teacher of the heart?
Soft she answered, no.

I met a girl across the sea,
Her hair the gold that gold can be,
Are you a teacher of the heart?
Yes, but not for thee.

I met a man who lost his mind
In some lost place I had to find,
Follow me, the wise man said,
But he walked behind.

I walked into a hospital
Where none was sick and none was well,
When at night the nurses left
I could not walk at all.

Morning came and then came noon,
Dinner time a scalpel blade
Lay beside my silver spoon.

Some girls wander by mistake
Into the mess that scalpels make.
Are you the teachers of my heart?
We teach old hearts to break.

One morning I woke up alone,
The hospital and the nurses gone.
Have I carved enough my Lord?
Child, you are a bone.

I ate and ate and ate,
No, I did not miss a plate, well
How much do these suppers cost?
Well take it out in hate.

I spent my hatred everyplace,
On every work, on every face,
Someone gave me wishes
And I wished for an embrace.

Several girls embraced me, then
I was embraced by men,
Is my passion perfect?
No, do it once again.

I was handsome, I was strong,
I knew the words of every song.
Did my singing please you?
No, the words you sang were wrong.

Who is it whom I address,
Who takes down what I confess?
Are you the teachers of my heart?
We teach old hearts to rest.

Oh teachers are my lessons done?
I cannot do another one.
They laughed and laughed and said
Well child,
Are your lessons done?
Are your lessons done?
Are your lessons done?",Teachers
Leonard Cohen,"Trav'ling lady, stay awhile 
Until the night is over. 
I'm just a station on your way, 
I know I'm not your lover. 
Well I lived with a child of snow 
When I was a soldier, 
And I fought every man for her 
Until the nights grew colder. 

She used to wear her hair like you 
Except when she was sleeping, 
And then she'd weave it on a loom 
Of smoke and gold and breathing. 

And why are you so quiet now 
Standing there in the doorway? 
You chose your journey long before 
You came upon this highway. 

Traveling lady stay awhile 
Until the night is over. 
I'm just a station on your way, 
I know I'm not your lover.",Winter Lady
Leonard Cohen,"I remember the promise
That you made in the barn
When the kittens were born
And you could not keep warm

So you moved away the mountain
That the sun rose behind
And you said yourself a prayer
And laid down with the blind

But you lost them in your freedom
And you need him now, you're wild
Blessed is the memory
Of everybody's child

And the vow of compassion
That you swore through your teeth
When the war began to end
And the photographs weep

Well, nobody blames you
As the train pulls away
With its cargo of snow
For these German paper-weights

But you lost them in your freedom
And you need him now, you're wild
Blessed is the memory
Of everybody's child

Well, its five in the morning
There's no one home
Except for your wife
And your child on the phone

Somebody's got to listen
To a promise or two
Oh, this room is far too small
For a pilgrim like you

But you lost them in your freedom
And you need him now, you're wild
Blessed is the memory
Of everybody's child

So, now that you've decided
To follow the sun
Like a shadow of birds
Or a King on the run

Oh, your chains are too dark
For the seas you must swim
You're smiling at the seaweed
But your smile is too grim

But you lost them in your freedom
And you need him now, you're wild
Blessed is the memory
Of everybody's child

Blessed is the memory
Of everybody's child
Blessed is the memory
Of everybody's child",Blessed Is the Memory [#][*]
Leonard Cohen,"A bunch of lonesome and very quarrelsome heroes 
Were smoking out along the open road; 
The night was very dark and thick between them, 
Each man beneath his ordinary load. 

""I'd like to tell my story,"" 
Said one of them so young and bold, 
""I'd like to tell my story, 
Before I turn into gold."" 

But no one really could hear him, 
The night so dark and thick and green; 
Well I guess that these heroes must always live there 
Where you and I have only been. 

Put out your cigarette, my love, 
You've been alone too long; 
And some of us are very hungry now 
To hear what it is you've done that was so wrong. 

I sing this for the crickets, 
I sing this for the army, 
I sing this for your children 
And for all who do not need me. 

""I'd like to tell my story,"" 
Said one of them so bold, 
""Oh yes, I'd like to tell my story 
'Cause you know I feel I'm turning into gold.""",A Bunch of Lonsome Heroes
Leonard Cohen,"I came upon a butcher,
He was slaughtering a lamb,
I accused him there
With his tortured lamb.

He said, Listen to me, child,
I am what I am and you, you are my only son.
Well, I found a silver needle,
I put it into my arm.

It did some good,
Did some harm.
But the nights were cold
And it almost kept me warm,
How come the night is long?
I saw some flowers growing up
Where that lamb fell down

Was I supposed to praise my Lord,
Make some kind of joyful sound?
He said, Listen, listen to me now,
I go round and round
And you, you are my only child.

Do not leave me now,
Do not leave me now,
I'm broken down
From a recent fall.

Blood upon my body
And ice upon my soul,
Lead on, my son, it is your world.",The Butcher
Leonard Cohen,"I finally broke into the prison,
I found my place in the chain.
Even damnation is poisoned with rainbows,
All the brave young men
They're waiting now to see a signal
Which some killer will be lighting for pay.
Into this furnace I ask you now to venture,
You whom I cannot betray.

I fought in the old revolution
On the side of the ghost and the King.
Of course I was very young
And I thought that we were winning;
I can't pretend I still feel very much like singing
As they carry the bodies away.
Into this furnace I ask you now to venture

Lately you've started to stutter
As though you had nothing to say.
To all of my architects let me be traitor.
Now let me say I myself gave the order
To sleep and to search and to destroy.
Into this furnace I ask you now to venture

Yes, you who are broken by power,
You who are absent all day,
You who are kings for the sake of your children's story,
The hand of your beggar is burdened down with money,
The hand of your lover is clay.
Into this furnace I ask you now to venture",The Old Revolution
Leonard Cohen,"It seems so long ago,
Nancy was alone,
Looking ate the Late Late show
Through a semi-precious stone.
In the House of Honesty
Her father was on trial,
In the House of Mystery
There was no one at all,
There was no one at all.

It seems so long ago,
None of us were strong
Nancy wore green stockings
And she slept with everyone.

She never said she'd wait for us
Although she was alone,
I think she fell in love for us
In nineteen sixty one,
In nineteen sixty one.

It seems so long ago,
Nancy was alone,
A forty five beside her head,
An open telephone.

We told her she was beautiful,
We told her she was free
But none of us would meet her in
The House of Mystery,
The House of Mystery.

And now you look around you,
See her everywhere,
Many use her body,
Many comb her hair.

In the hollow of the night
When you are cold and numb
You hear her talking freely then,
She's happy that you've come,
She's happy that you've come.","Seems So Long Ago, Nancy"
Leonard Cohen,"The door it opened slowly, 
My father he came in, 
I was nine years old. 
And he stood so tall above me, 
His blue eyes they were shining 
And his voice was very cold. 
He said, ""I've had a vision 
And you know I'm strong and holy, 
I must do what I've been told."" 
So he started up the mountain, 
I was running, he was walking, 
And his axe was made of gold. 

Well, the trees they got much smaller, 
The lake a lady's mirror, 
We stopped to drink some wine. 
Then he threw the bottle over. 
Broke a minute later 
And he put his hand on mine. 
Thought I saw an eagle 
But it might have been a vulture, 
I never could decide. 
Then my father built an altar, 
He looked once behind his shoulder, 
He knew I would not hide. 

You who build these altars now 
To sacrifice these children, 
You must not do it anymore. 
A scheme is not a vision 
And you never have been tempted 
By a demon or a god. 
You who stand above them now, 
Your hatchets blunt and bloody, 
You were not there before, 
When I lay upon a mountain 
And my father's hand was trembling 
With the beauty of the word. 

And if you call me brother now, 
Forgive me if I inquire, 
""just according to whose plan?"" 
When it all comes down to dust 
I will kill you if I must, 
I will help you if I can. 
When it all comes down to dust 
I will help you if I must, 
I will kill you if I can. 
And mercy on our uniform, 
Man of peace or man of war, 
The peacock spreads his fan.",Story of Isaac

You cannot follow me.
I am the distance you put between
All of the moments that we will be.

You know who I am,
You've stared at the sun,
Well I am the one who loves
Changing from nothing to one.

Sometimes I need you naked,
Sometimes I need you wild,
I need you to carry my children in
And I need you to kill a child.
You know who I am

If you should ever track me down
I will surrender there
And I will leave with you one broken man
Whom I will teach you to repair.

Thinking of the past
We swore to each other then
Our love would surely last

You kept right on loving
I went on a fast
Now I am too thin
And your love is too vast

But I know from your eyes
And I know from your smile
That tonight will be fine
Will be fine, will be fine, will be fine
For a while

I choose the rooms that I live in with care
The windows are small and the walls almost bare
There's only one bed and there's only one prayer
I listen all night for your step on the stair

But I know from your eyes
And I know from your smile
That tonight will be fine
Will be fine, will be fine, will be fine
For a while

Oh, sometimes I see her undressing for me
She's the soft naked lady love meant her to be
And she's moving her body so brave and so free
If I've got to remember that's a fine memory

And I know from her eyes
And I know from her smile
That tonight will be fine
Will be fine, will be fine, will be fine

Leonard Cohen,"Well I stepped into an avalanche,
It covered up my soul;
When I am not this hunchback that you see,
I sleep beneath the golden hill.
You who wish to conquer pain,
You must learn, learn to serve me well.

You strike my side by accident
As you go down for your gold.
The cripple here that you clothe and feed
Is neither starved nor cold;
He does not ask for your company,
Not at the centre, the centre of the world.

When I am on a pedestal,
You did not raise me there.
Your laws do not compel me
To kneel grotesque and bare.
I myself am the pedestal
For this ugly hump at which you stare.

You who wish to conquer pain,
You must learn what makes me kind;
The crumbs of love that you offer me,
They're the crumbs I've left behind.
Your pain is no credential here,
It's just the shadow, shadow of my wound.

I have begun to long for you,
I who have no greed
I have begun to ask for you,
I who have no need.
You say you've gone away from me,
But I can feel you when you breathe.

Do not dress in those rags for me,
I know you are not poor
You don't love me quite so fiercely now
When you know that you are not sure,
It is your turn, beloved,
It is your flesh that I wear.",Avalanche
Leonard Cohen,"Four o'clock in the afternoon 
And I didn't feel like very much. 
I said to myself, ""Where are you golden boy, 
Where is your famous golden touch?"" 
I thought you knew where 
All of the elephants lie down, 
I thought you were the crown prince 
Of all the wheels in Ivory Town. 

Just take a look at your body now, 
There's nothing much to save 
And a bitter voice in the mirror cries, 
""Hey, Prince, you need a shave."" 

Now if you can manage to get 
Your trembling fingers to behave, 
Why don't you try unwrapping 
A stainless steel razor blade? 

That's right, it's come to this, 
Yes it's come to this, 
And wasn't it a long way down, 
Wasn't it a strange way down? 

There's no hot water 
And the cold is running thin. 
Well, what do you expect from 
The kind of places you've been living in? 

Don't drink from that cup, 
It's all caked and cracked along the rim. 
That's not the electric light, my friend, 
That is your vision growing dim. 

Cover up your face with soap, there, 
Now you're Santa Claus. 
And you've got a gift for anyone 
Who will give you his applause. 

I thought you were a racing man, 
Ah, but you couldn't take the pace. 
That's a funeral in the mirror 
And it's stopping at your face. 

That's right, it's come to this, 
Yes it's come to this, 
And wasn't it a long way down, 
Ah wasn't it a strange way down? 

Once there was a path 
And a girl with chestnut hair, 
And you passed the summers 
Picking all of the berries that grew there
There were times she was a woman, 
Oh, there were times she was just a child, 
And you held her in the shadows 
Where the raspberries grow wild. 

And you climbed the twilight mountains 
And you sang about the view, 
And everywhere that you wandered 
Love seemed to go along with you. 
That's a hard one to remember, 
Yes it makes you clench your fist. 

And then the veins stand out like highways, 
All along your wrist. 
And yes it's come to this, 
It's come to this, 
And wasn't it a long way down, 
Wasn't it a strange way down? 

You can still find a job, 
Go out and talk to a friend. 
On the back of every magazine 
There are those coupons you can send. 
Why don't you join the Rosicrucians, 
They can give you back your hope, 
You can find your love with diagrams 
On a plain brown envelope. 

But you've used up all your coupons 
Except the one that seems 
To be written on your wrist 
Along with several thousand dreams. 

Now Santa Claus comes forward, 
That's a razor in his mit
And he puts on his dark glasses 
And he shows you where to hit
And then the cameras pan,

It's just a dress rehearsal rag.",Dress Rehearsal Rag

Between the ocean and your open vein,
Between the snowman and the rain,
Once again, once again,
Love calls you by your name.

The women in your scrapbook
Whom you still praise and blame,
You say they chained you to your fingernails
And you climb the halls of fame.
Oh but here, right here,
Between the peanuts and the cage,
Between the darkness and the stage,
Between the hour and the age,
Once again, once again,
Love calls you by your name.

Shouldering your loneliness
Like a gun that you will not learn to aim,
You stumble into this movie house,
Then you climb, you climb into the frame.

Between the moonlight and the lane,
Between the tunnel and the train,
Between the victim and his stain,
Once again, once again,

I leave the lady meditating
On the very love which I, I do not wish to claim,
I journey down the hundred steps,
But the street is still the very same.
And here, right here,
Between the dancer and his cane,
Between the sailboat and the drain,
Between the newsreel and your tiny pain,
Once again, once again,
Love calls you by your name.

Where are you, Judy, where are you, Anne? 
Where are the paths your heroes came? 
Wondering out loud as the bandage pulls away,
Was I, was I only limping, was I really lame?

Between the sundial and the chain,
Between the traitor and her pain,

Leonard Cohen,"Getting sick of starting over
On the same
Argument
We could sit around and talk it over 
Or take a trip
To clear our minds
At the entrance of Mount Wilson
It's feeling like the right decision
Some times you go outside
To get inside
If I could only hear you say
That you are down but you're ok
We should have said the things we felt
Is it too late
Park the car and hit the trail
The air feels sharp
On our skin
We'll see the snow as it is melting
Spring must be on
Her way again
We didn't see her coming for us
I guess that's mother nature's way
Sometimes you go outside
To get inside
If I could only hear you say
That you are down but you're ok

Trapped beneath the wall of snow
You're only ten
Feet away

Glad that I ran into you.

Leonard Cohen,"I was walking in New York City and I brushed up against the man in front of
me. I felt a cardboard placard on his back. And when we passed a streetlight,
I could read it, it said ""Please don't pass me by - I am blind, but you can
see - I've been blinded totally - Please don't pass me by."" I was walking
along 7th Avenue, when I came to 14th Street I saw on the corner curious
mutilations of the human form; it was a school for handicapped people. And
there were cripples, and people in wheelchairs and crutches and it was snowing,
and I got this sense that the whole city was singing this:
Oh please don't pass me by,
oh please don't pass me by,
for I am blind, but you can see,
yes, I've been blinded totally,
oh please don't pass me by.
And you know as I was walking I thought it was them who were singing it, I
thought it was they who were singing it, I thought it was the other who was
singing it, I thought it was someone else. But as I moved along I knew it was
me, and that I was singing it to myself. It went:
Please don't pass me by,
oh please don't pass me by,
for I am blind, but you can see,
well, I've been blinded totally,
oh please don't pass me by.
Oh please don't pass me by.
Now I know that you're sitting there deep in your velvet seats and you're
thinking ""Uh, he's up there saying something that he thinks about, but I'll
never have to sing that song."" But I promise you friends, that you're going
to be singing this song: it may not be tonight, it may not be tomorrow, but
one day you'll be on your knees and I want you to know the words when the
time comes. Because you're going to have to sing it to yourself, or to another,
or to your brother. You're going to have to learn to sing this song, it goes:
Please don't pass me by,
ah you don't have to sing this .. not for you.
Please don't pass me by,
for I am blind, but you can see,
yes, I've been blinded totally,
oh please don't pass me by.
Well I sing this for the Jews and the Gypsies and the smoke that they made.
And I sing this for the children of England, their faces so grave. And I sing
this for a saviour with no one to save. Hey, won't you be naked for me? Hey,
won't you be naked for me? It goes:
Please don't pass me by,
oh please don't pass me by,
for I am blind, but you can see,
yes, I've been blinded totally,
oh now, please don't pass me by.
Now there's nothing that I tell you that will help you connect the blood
tortured night with the day that comes next. But I want it to hurt you, I
want it to end. Oh, won't you be naked for me? Oh now:
Please don't pass me by,
oh please don't pass me by,
for I am blind, but you can see,
but I've been blinded totally,
oh, please don't pass me by.
Well I sing this song for you Blonde Beasts, I sing this song for you Venuses
upon your shells on the foam of the sea. And I sing this for the freaks and
the cripples, and the hunchback, and the burned, and the burning, and the
maimed, and the broken, and the torn, and all of those that you talk about at
the coffee tables, at the meetings, and the demonstrations, on the streets,
in your music, in my songs. I mean the real ones that are burning, I mean the
real ones that are burning
I say, please don't pass me by,
oh now, please don't pass me by,
for I am blind, yeah but you can see,
ah now, I've been blinded totally,
oh no, please don't pass me by.
I know that you still think that its me. I know that you think that there's
somebody else. I know that these words aren't yours. But I tell you friends
that one day
You're going to get down on your knees,
you're going to get down on your knees,
you're going to get down on your knees,
you're going to get down on your knees,
you're going to get down on your knees,
you're going to get down on your knees,
you're going to get down on your knees,
you're going to get down on your knees,
you're going to get down ..
Oh, please don't pass me by,
oh, please don't pass me by,
for I am blind, yeah but you can see,
yes, I've been blinded totally,
oh, please don't pass me by.
Well you know I have my songs and I have my poems. I have my book and I have
the army, and sometimes I have your applause. I make some money, but you know
what my friends, I'm still out there on the corner. I'm with the freaks, I'm
with the hunted, I'm with the maimed, yes I'm with the torn, I'm with the down,
I'm with the poor. Come on now ...
Ah, please don't pass me by,
well I've got to go now friends,
but, please don't pass me by,
for I am blind, yeah but you can see,
oh, I've been blinded, I've been blinded totally,
oh now, please don't pass me by.
Now I want to take away my dignity, yes take my dignity. My friends, take my
dignity, take my form, take my style, take my honour, take my courage, take
my time, take my time, .. time .. 'Cause you know I'm with you singing this
song. And I wish you would, I wish you would, I wish you would go home with
someone else. Wish you'd go home with someone else. I wish you'd go home with
someone else. Don't be the person that you came with. Oh, don't be the person
that you came with, Oh don't be the person that you came with. Ah, I'm not
going to be. I can't stand him. I can't stand who I am. That's why I've got to
get down on my knees. Because I can't make it by myself. I'm not by myself
anymore because the man I was before he was a tyrant, he was a slave, he was
in chains, he was broken and then he sang:
Oh, please don't pass me by,
oh, please don't pass me by,
for I am blind, yes I am blind, Oh but you can see,
yes, I've been blinded totally,
oh, please don't pass me by.
Well I hope I see you out there on the corner. Yeah I hope as I go by that I
hear you whisper with the breeze. Because I'm going to leave you now, I'm
going to find me someone new. Find someone new.
And please don't pass me by.",Please Don't Pass Me by (A Disgrace)
Leonard Cohen,"Queen Victoria,
My father and all his tobacco loved you,
I love you too in all your forms,
The slim and lovely virgin floating among German beer,
The mean governess of the huge pink maps,
The solitary mourner of a prince.

Queen Victoria,
I am cold and rainy,
I am dirty as a glass roof in a train station,
I feel like an empty cast iron exhibition,
I want ornaments on everything,
Because my love, she gone with other boys.

Queen Victoria,
Do you have a punishment under the white lace,
Will you be short with her, will you make her read those little Bibles,
Will you spank her with a mechanical corset.
I want her pure as power, I want her skin slightly musty with petticoats
Will you wash the easy bidet out of her head?

Queen Victoria,
I'm not much nourished by modern love,
Will you come into my life
With your sorrow and your black carriages,
And your perfect
Memories.

Queen Victoria,
The Twentieth Century belongs to you and me.
Let us be two severe giants not less lonely for our partnership,
Who discolor test tubes in the halls of Science,
Who turn up unwelcome at every World's Fair,
Heavy with proverbs and corrections,
Confusing the star-dazed tourists
With our incomparable sense of loss.",Queen Victoria
Leonard Cohen,"Field Commander Cohen, he was our most important spy. 
Wounded in the line of duty, 
Parachuting acid into diplomatic cocktail parties, 
Urging Fidel Castro to abandon fields and castles. 
Leave it all and like a man,

Such as waiting rooms and ticket lines, 
Silver bullet suicides, 
And messianic ocean tides, 
And racial roller-coaster rides 
And other forms of boredom advertised as poetry. 
I know you need your sleep now, 
I know your life's been hard. 
But many men are falling, 
Where you promised to stand guard. 

I never asked but I heard you cast your lot along with the poor. 
But then I overheard your prayer, 
That you be this and nothing more 
Than just some grateful faithful woman's favorite singing millionaire, 
The patron Saint of envy and the grocer of despair, 
Working for the Yankee Dollar. 

I know you need your sleep now

Ah, lover come and lie with me, if my lover is who you are, 
And be your sweetest self awhile until I ask for more, my child. 
Then let the other selves be wrong, yeah, let them manifest and come

I was the very reverend Freud
You were the manual orgasm

And is this what you wanted
To live in a house that is haunted
By the ghost of you and me?

Is this what you wanted...

Leonard Cohen,"Alas, my love, you did me wrong,
To cast me out discourteously,
For I have loved you so long,
Delighting in your very company.
Now if you intend to show me disdain,
Don't you know it all the more enraptures me,
For even so I still remain your lover in captivity.
Green sleeves, you're all alone,
The leaves have fallen, the men have gone.
Green sleeves, there's no one home,
Not even the Lady Green Sleeves

I sang my songs, I told my lies,
To lie between your matchless thighs.
And ain't it fine, ain't it wild
To finally end our exercise
Then I saw you naked in the early dawn,
Oh, I hoped you would be someone new.
I reached for you but you were gone,
So lady I'm going too.

Leonard Cohen,"Now the courtroom is quiet, but who will confess 
Is it true you betrayed us? The answer is ""yes""
Then read me the list of the crimes that are mine 
I will ask for the mercy that you love to decline 
And all the ladies go moist, and the judge has no choice 
A singer must die for the lie in his voice 
And I thank you, I thank you for doing your duty
You keepers of truth, you guardians of beauty 
Your vision is right, my vision is wrong 
I'm sorry for smudging the air with my song

Oh, the night it is thick, my defences are hid 
In the clothes of a woman I would like to forgive 
In the rings of her silk, in the hinge of her thighs 
Where I have to go begging in beauty's disguise
Oh goodnight, goodnight, my night after night 

I am so afraid that I listen to you
Your sun glassed protectors they do that to you
It's their ways to detain, their ways to disgrace 
Their knee in your balls and their fist in your face

Leonard Cohen,"Why don't you try to do without him? 
Why don't you try to live alone? 
Do you really need his hands for your passion? 
Do you really need his heart for your throne? 
Do you need his labour for your baby? 
Do you need his beast for the bone? 
Do you need to hold a leash to be a lady? 
I know you're going to make, make it on your own
Why don't your try to forget him? 
Just open up your dainty little hand
You know this life is filled with many sweet companions
Many satisfying one-night stands
Do you want to be the ditch around a tower? 
Do you want to be the moonlight in his cave? 
Do you want to give your blessing to his power 
As he goes whistling past his daddy, past his daddy's grave

I'd like to take you take you to the ceremony
Well, that is if I remember the way
You see Jack and Jill they're going to join their misery
I'm afraid it's time for everyone to pray

Leonard Cohen,"I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were talking so brave and so sweet
Giving me head on the unmade bed
While the limousines wait in the street
Those were the reasons and that was New York
We were running for the money and the flesh
And that was called love for the workers in song
Probably still is for those of them left

Ah but you got away, didn't you babe
You just turned your back on the crowd
You got away, I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you
I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around

I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were famous, your heart was a legend
You told me again you preferred handsome men
But for me you would make an exception
And clenching your fist for the ones like us
Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty
You fixed yourself, you said, ""Well never mind,
We are ugly but we have the music""

Leonard Cohen,"Like a bird on the wire
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free

Like a worm on a hook
Like a knight from some old-fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons for thee
If I, if I have been unkind
I hope that you can just let it go by
If I, if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you

For like a baby, stillborn
Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me
But I swear by this song
And by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee

I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch
He said to me, ""you must not ask for so much""
And a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door
She cried to me, ""hey, why not ask for more?""

I'm writing you now just to see if you're better
New York is cold, but I like where I'm living
There's music on Clinton Street all through the evening

I hear that you're building your little house deep in the desert
You're living for nothing now, I hope you're keeping some kind of record

Yes, and Jane came by with a lock of your hair
She said that you gave it to her
That night that you planned to go clear
Did you ever go clear?

Ah, the last time we saw you you looked so much older
Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder
You'd been to the station to meet every train, and
You came home without Lili Marlene

And you treated my woman to a flake of your life
And when she came back she was nobody's wife

Well I see you there with the rose in your teeth
One more thin gypsy thief
Well, I see Jane's awake
She sends her regards

And what can I tell you my brother, my killer
What can I possibly say?
I guess that I miss you, I guess I forgive you
I'm glad you stood in my way

If you ever come by here, for Jane or for me
Well, your enemy is sleeping, and his woman is free

Yes, and thanks, for the trouble you took from her eyes
I thought it was there for good so I never tried

And Jane came by with a lock of your hair
She said that you gave it to her
That night that you planned to go clear

Leonard Cohen,"I loved you in the morning, our kisses deep and warm
Your hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm
Yes, many loved before us, I know that we are not new
In city and in forest they smiled like me and you
But now it's come to distances and both of us must try
Your eyes are soft with sorrow
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye

I'm not looking for another as I wander in my time
Walk me to the corner, our steps will always rhyme
You know my love goes with you as your love stays with me
It's just the way it changes, like the shoreline and the sea
But let's not talk of love or chains and things we can't untie
Your eyes are soft with sorrow
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye

Leonard Cohen,"I came by myself to a very crowded place;
I was looking for someone who had lines in her face.
I found her there but she was past all concern;
I asked her to hold me, I said, ""Lady, unfold me,""
But she scorned me and she told me
I was dead and I could never return.

Well, I argued all night like so many have before,
Saying, ""Whatever you give me, I seem to need so much more.""
Then she pointed at me where I kneeled on her floor,
She said, ""Don't try to use me or slyly refuse me,
Just win me or lose me,
It is this that the darkness is for.""

I cried, ""Oh, Lady Midnight, I fear that you grow old,
The stars eat your body and the wind makes you cold.""
""If we cry now,"" she said, ""it will just be ignored.""
So I walked through the morning, sweet early morning,
I could hear my lady calling,
""You've won me, you've won me, my lord,
You've won me, you've won me, my lord,
Yes, you've won me, you've won me, my lord,

Ah, you've won me, you've won me, my lord,
Ah, you've won me, you've won me, my lord.""",Lady Midnight
Leonard Cohen,"The rain falls down on last year's man,
That's a Jew's harp on the table,
That's a crayon in his hand.
And the corners of the blueprint are ruined since they rolled
Far past the stems of thumbtacks
That still throw shadows on the wood.
And the skylight is like skin for a drum I'll never mend
And all the rain falls down amen
On the works of last year's man.

I met a lady, she was playing with her soldiers in the dark
Oh one by one she had to tell them
That her name was Joan of Arc.
I was in that army, yes I stayed a little while;
I want to thank you, Joan of Arc,
For treating me so well.

And though I wear a uniform I was not born to fight;
All these wounded boys you lie beside,
Goodnight, my friends, goodnight.

I came upon a wedding that old families had contrived;
Bethlehem the bridegroom,
Babylon the bride.
Great Babylon was naked, oh she stood there trembling for me,
And Bethlehem inflamed us both
Like the shy one at some orgy.
And when we fell together all our flesh was like a veil
That I had to draw aside to see
The serpent eat its tail.

Some women wait for Jesus, and some women wait for Cain
So I hang upon my altar
And I hoist my axe again.
And I take the one who finds me back to where it all began
When Jesus was the honeymoon
And Cain was just the man.
And we read from pleasant Bibles that are bound in blood and skin
That the wilderness is gathering
All its children back again.

The rain falls down on last year's man,
An hour has gone by
And he has not moved his hand.
But everything will happen if he only gives the word;
The lovers will rise up
And the mountains touch the ground.
But the skylight is like skin for a drum I'll never mend
And all the rain falls down amen
On the works of last year's man.",Last Year's Man
Leonard Cohen,"When they poured across the border
I was cautioned to surrender
This I could not do
I took my gun and vanished.

I have changed my name so often
I've lost my wife and children
But I have many friends
And some of them are with me

An old woman gave us shelter
Kept us hidden in the garret
Then the soldiers came
She died without a whisper

There were three of us this morning
I'm the only one this evening
But I must go on
The frontiers are my prison

Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing
Through the graves the wind is blowing
Freedom soon will come
Then we'll come from the shadows

Les Allemands étaient chez moi
Ils me dirent, ""résigne toi""
Mais je n'ai pas peur
J'ai repris mon âme

J'ai changé cent fois de nom
J'ai perdu femme et enfants
Mais j'ai tant d'amis
J'ai la France entière

Un vieil homme dans un grenier
Pour la nuit nous a caché
Les Allemands l'ont pris
Il est mort sans surprise

Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing
Through the graves the wind is blowing
Freedom soon will come
Then we'll come from the shadows",The Partisan
Leonard Cohen,"Oh, the sisters of mercy, they are not departed or gone
They were waiting for me when I thought that I just can't go on
And they brought me their comfort and later they brought me this song
Oh, I hope you run into them, you who've been travelling so long

Yes, you who must leave everything that you cannot control
It begins with your family, but soon it comes around to your soul
Well, I've been where you're hanging, I think I can see how you're pinned
When you're not feeling holy, your loneliness says that you've sinned

Well, they lay down beside me, I made my confession to them
They touched both my eyes and I touched the dew on their hem
If your life is a leaf that the seasons tear off and condemn
They will bind you with love that is graceful and green as a stem

When I left they were sleeping, I hope you run into them soon
Don't turn on the lights, you can read their address by the moon
And you won't make me jealous if I hear that they sweetened your night
We weren't lovers like that and besides, it would still be all right
We weren't lovers like that and besides, it would still be all right",Sisters of Mercy
Leonard Cohen,"Come over to the window, my little darling
I'd like to try to read your palm
I used to think I was some kind of Gypsy boy
Before I let you take me home

Now so long, Marianne
It's time that we began to laugh
And cry and cry and laugh about it all again

Well, you know that I love to live with you
But you make me forget so very much
I forget to pray for the angels
And then the angels forget to pray for us

Now so long, Marianne
It's time that we began to laugh
And cry and cry and laugh about it all again

We met when we were almost young
Deep in the green lilac park
You held on to me like I was a crucifix
As we went kneeling through the dark

Oh, so long, Marianne
It's time that we began to laugh
And cry and cry and laugh about it all again

Your letters, they all say that you're beside me now
Then why do I feel alone?
I'm standing on a ledge and your fine spider web
Is fastening my ankle to a stone

Now so long, Marianne
It's time that we began to laugh
And cry and cry and laugh about it all again

For now I need your hidden love
I'm cold as a new razorblade
You left when I told you I was curious
I never said that I was brave

Oh, so long, Marianne
It's time that we began to laugh
And cry and cry and laugh about it all again

Oh, you are really such a pretty one
I see you've gone and changed your name again
And just when I climbed this whole mountainside
To wash my eyelids in the rain

Leonard Cohen,"Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river
You can hear the boats go by, you can spend the night forever
And you know that she's half-crazy but that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges that come all the way from China
And just when you mean to tell her that you have no love to give her
Then he gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer that you've always been her lover

And you want to travel with her, and you want to travel blind
And you know that she will trust you
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind

And Jesus was a sailor when he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching from his lonely wooden tower
And when he knew for certain only drowning men could see him
He said all men will be sailors then until the sea shall free them
But he himself was broken, long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human, he sank beneath your wisdom like a stone

And you want to travel with him, and you want to travel blind
And you think you maybe you'll trust him
For he's touched your perfect body with her mind

Now, Suzanne takes your hand and she leads you to the river
She's wearing rags and feathers from Salvation Army counters
And the sun pours down like honey on our lady of the harbor
And she shows you where to look among the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed, there are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love and they wil lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds her mirror

And you want to travel with her, and you want to travel blind
And you know that you can trust her
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind",Suzanne
Leonard Cohen,"Many men have loved the bells
You fastened to the rein
And everyone who wanted you
They found what they will always want again
Your beauty lost to you yourself
Just as it was lost to them

Oh, take this longing from my tongue
Whatever useless things these hands have done
Let me see your beauty broken down
Like you would do for one you love

Your body like a searchlight
My poverty revealed
I would like to try your charity
Until you cry, ""now you must try my greed""
And everything depends upon
How near you sleep to me

Just take this longing from my tongue
All the lonely things my hands have done
Let me see your beauty broken down
Like you would do for one your love

Hungry as an archway
Through which the troops have passed
I stand in ruins behind you
With your winter clothes, your broken sandal straps
I love to see you naked over there
Especially from the back

Oh, take this longing from my tongue
All the useless things my hands have done
Untie for me your hired blue gown
Like you would do for one that you love

You're faithful to the better man
I'm afraid that he left
So let me judge your love affair
In this very room where I have sentenced mine to death
I'll even wear these old laurel leaves
That he's shaken from his head

Just take this longing from my tongue
All the useless things my hands have done
Let me see your beauty broken down
Like you would do for one you love
Like you would do for one you love",Take This Longing
Leonard Cohen,"And who by fire, who by water
Who in the sunshine, who in the night time
Who by high ordeal, who by common trial
Who in your merry-merry month of may
Who by very slow decay
And who shall I say is calling?

And who in her lonely slip, who by barbiturate
Who in these realms of love, who by something blunt
Who by avalanche, who by powder
Who for his greed, who for his hunger
And who shall I say is calling?

And who by brave assent, who by accident
Who in solitude, who in this mirror
Who by his lady's command, who by his own hand
Who in mortal chains, who in power
And who shall I say is calling?",Who by Fire
Leonard Cohen,"Ah the man she wanted all her life was hanging by a thread
""I never even knew how much I wanted you,"" she said.
His muscles they were numbered and his style was obsolete.
""O baby, I have come too late."" She knelt beside his feet.
""I'll never see a face like yours in years of men to come
I'll never see such arms again in wrestling or in love.""
And all his virtues burning in the smoky Holocaust
She took unto herself most everything her lover lost
Now the master of this landscape he was standing at the view
With a sparrow of St. Francis that he was preaching to
She beckoned to the sentry of his high religious mood
She said, ""I'll make a place between my legs,
I'll show you solitude.""

He offered her an orgy in a many mirrored room
He promised her protection for the issue of her womb
She moved her body hard against a sharpened metal spoon
She stopped the bloody rituals of passage to the moon

She took his much admired oriental frame of mind
And the heart-of-darkness alibi his money hides behind
She took his blonde Madonna and his monastery wine 
""This mental space is occupied and everything is mine.""

He tried to make a final stand beside the railway track
She said, ""The art of longing's over and it's never coming back.""
She took his tavern parliament, his cap, his cocky dance,
She mocked his female fashions and his working-class mustache.

The last time that I saw him he was trying hard to get
A woman's education but he's not a woman yet
And the last time that I saw her she was living with some boy
Who gives her soul an empty room and gives her body joy.

So the great affair is over but whoever would have guessed
It would leave us all so vacant and so deeply unimpressed
It's like our visit to the moon or to that other star
I guess you go for nothing if you really want to go that far.

You can't melt it down in the rain

You can't melt it down in the rain
You can't melt it down in the rain

I've looked behind all of the faces
That smile you down to you knees

Approach her, you ape with your tail on
Once you have her she'll always be there

Once you have her she'll always be there [Repeat: x4]

Ah but don't go home with your hard-on 

So I work in that same beauty salon
I'm chained to the old masquerade

Leonard Cohen,"I touched you once too often
Now I don't know who I am
My fingerprints were missing
When I wiped away the jam
Yes I called my fingerprints all night
But they don't seem to care
The last time that I saw them
They were leafing through your hair

Fingerprints, fingerprints
Where are you now my fingerprints?

Yeah I thought I'd leave this morning
So I emptied out your drawer
A hundred thousand fingerprints
They floated to the floor

You know you hardly stopped to pick them up
You don't care what you lose
Ah you don't even seem to know
Whose fingerprints are whose

Fingerprints, fingerprints
Where are you now my fingerprints?

And now you want to marry me
You want to take me down the aisle
You want to throw confetti fingerprints
You know that's not my style

O sure I'd like to marry you
But I can't face the dawn
With any girl who knew me
When my fingerprints were on

Fingerprints, fingerprints
Where are you now my fingerprints?

Fingerprints, oh fingerprints
Where are you now my fingerprints?",Fingerprints
Leonard Cohen,"I left a woman waiting
I met her sometime later
She said, I see your eyes are dead
What happened to you, lover?
What happened to you, my lover?
What happened to you, lover?
What happened to you?

And since she spoke the truth to me
I tried to answer truthfully
Whatever happened to my eyes
Happened to your beauty
Happened to your beauty
What happened to your beauty
Happened to me

We took ourselves to someone's bed
And there we fell together
Quick as dogs and truly dead were we
And free as running water
Free as running water
Free as running water
Free as you and me
The way it's got to be
The way it's got to be, lover",I Left a Woman Waiting
Leonard Cohen,"I needed you, I knew I was in danger
Of losing what I used to think was mine
You let me love you till I was a failure,
You let me love you till I was a failure 
Your beauty on my bruise like iodine
I asked you if a man could be forgiven
And though I failed at love, was this a crime?
You said, Don't worry, don't worry, darling
You said, Don't worry, don't you worry, darling
There are many ways a man can serve his time

You covered up that place I could not master
It wasn't dark enough to shut my eyes
So I was with you, O sweet compassion
Yes I was with you, O sweet compassion
Compassion with the sting of iodine

Your saintly kisses reeked of iodine
Your fragrance with a fume of iodine
And pity in the room like iodine

Your sister fingers burned like iodine
And all my wanton lust was iodine
My masquerade of trust was iodine
And everywhere the flare of iodine",Iodine
Leonard Cohen,"Frankie Lane, he was singing Jezebel
I pinned an Iron Cross to my lapel
I walked up to the tallest and the blondest girl
I said, Look, you don't know me now but very soon you will
So won't you let me see
I said ""won't you let me see""
I said ""won't you let me see
Your naked body?""

Just dance me to the dark side of the gym
Chances are I'll let you do most anything
I know you're hungry, I can hear it in your voice
And there are many parts of me to touch, you have your choice
Ah but no you cannot see
She said ""no you cannot see""
She said ""no you cannot see
My naked body""

So We're dancing close, the band is playing Stardust
Balloons and paper streamers floating down on us
She says, You've got a minute left to fall in love
In solemn moments such as this I have put my trust
And all my faith to see
I said all my faith to see
I said all my faith to see
Her naked body",Memories
Leonard Cohen,"The walls of this hotel are paper-thin 
Last night I heard you making love to him 
The struggle mouth to mouth and limb to limb 
The grunt of unity when he came in 
I stood there with my ear against the wall 
I was not seized by jealousy at all 
In fact a burden lifted from my soul 
I heard that love was out of my control 
A heavy burden lifted from my soul 
I heard that love was out of my control 

I listened to your kisses at the door 
I never heard the world so clear before 
You ran your bath and you began to sing 
I felt so good I couldn't feel a thing 

I stood there with my ear against the wall

And I can't wait to tell you to your face 
And I can't wait for you to take my place 
You are The Naked Angel In My Heart 
You are The Woman With Her Legs Apart 
It's written on the walls of this hotel 
You go to heaven once you've been to hell 

A heavy burden lifted from my soul 
I heard that love was out of my control",Paper Thin Hotel
Leonard Cohen,"As the mist leaves no scar 
On the dark green hill 
So my body leaves no scar 
On you and never will 
Through windows in the dark 
The children come, the children go 
Like arrows with no targets 
Like shackles made of snow 

True love leaves no traces 
If you and I are one 
It's lost in our embraces 
Like stars against the sun 

As a falling leaf may rest 
A moment on the air 
So your head upon my breast 
So my hand upon your hair 

And many nights endure 
Without a moon or star 
So we will endure 
When one is gone and far 

True love leaves no traces 
If you and I are one 
It's lost in our embraces 
Like stars against the sun",True Love Leaves No Traces
Leonard Cohen,"Say a prayer for the cowboy
His mare's run away
And he'll walk til he finds her
His darling, his stray
But the river's in flood
And the roads are awash
And the bridges break up
In the panic of loss.

And there's nothing to follow
There's nowhere to go
She's gone like the summer
Gone like the snow
And the crickets are breaking
His heart with their song
As the day caves in
And the night is all wrong

Did he dream, was it she
Who went galloping past
And bent down the fern
Broke open the grass
And printed the mud with
The iron and the gold
That he nailed to her feet
When he was the lord

And although she goes grazing
A minute away
He tracks her all night
He tracks her all day
Oh blind to her presence
Except to compare
His injury here
With her punishment there

Then at home on a branch
In the highest tree
A songbird sings out
So suddenly
Ah the sun is warm
And the soft winds ride
On the willow trees
By the river side

Oh the world is sweet
The world is wide
And she's there where
The light and the darkness divide
And the steam's coming off her
She's huge and she's shy
And she steps on the moon
When she paws at the sky

And she comes to his hand
But she's not really tame
She longs to be lost
He longs for the same
And she'll bolt and she'll plunge
Through the first open pass
To roll and to feed
In the sweet mountain grass

Or she'll make a break
For the high plateau
Where there's nothing above
And there's nothing below
And it's time for the burden
It's time for the whip
Will she walk through the flame
Can he shoot from the hip

So he binds himself
To the galloping mare
And she binds herself
To the rider there
And there is no space
But there's left and right
And there is no time
But there's day and night

And he leans on her neck
And he whispers low
""Whither thou goest
I will go""
And they turn as one
And they head for the plain
No need for the whip
Ah, no need for the rein

Now the clasp of this union
Who fastens it tight?
Who snaps it asunder
The very next night
Some say the rider
Some say the mare
Or that love's like the smoke
Beyond all repair

But my darling says
""Leonard, just let it go by
That old silhouette
On the great western sky""
So I pick out a tune
And they move right along
And they're gone like the smoke
And they're gone like this song",Ballad of the Absent Mare
Leonard Cohen,"I came so far for beauty
I left so much behind
My patience and my family
My masterpiece unsigned

I thought I'd be rewarded
For such a lonely choice
And surely she would answer
To such a very hopeless voice

I practiced all my sainthood
I gave to one and all
But the rumors of my virtue
They moved her not at all

I changed my style to silver
I changed my clothed to black
And where I would surrender
Now I would attack 

I stormed the old casino
For the money and the flesh 
And I myself decided
What was rotten and what was fresh

And men to do my bidding
And broken bones to teach
The value of my pardon
The shadow of my reach

But no, I could not touch her
With such a heavy hand
Her star beyond my order
Her nakedness unmanned

I came so far for beauty
I left so much behind
My patience and my family
My masterpiece unsigned",Came So Far for Beauty

And no one knows where the night is going

whose darkness deepens in her arms a little more 
And where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight? 
Where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight? 

Ah the silver knives are flashing in the tired old cafe 
A ghost climbs on the table in a bridal negligee 
She says, ""My body is the light, my body is the way"" 
I raise my arm against it all and I catch the bride's bouquet 

And where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight? 
Too early for the rainbow, too early for the dove

That we pledged in the passionate night
Ah they're soiled now, they're torn at the edges
Like moths on a still yellow light

No massive transfusions of trust
Why not even revenge can undo them
So twisted these vows and so crushed

And you say you've been humbled in love
Cut down in your love
Forced to kneel in the mud next to me
Ah but why so bitterly turn from the one
Who kneels there as deeply as thee

Children have takes these pledges
They have ferried them out of the past
Oh beyond all the graves and the hedges
Where love must go hiding at last
And here where there is no description
Oh here in the moment at hand
No sinner need rise up forgiven
No victim need limp to the stand

And you say you've been humbled in love
And look dear heart, look at the virgin
Look how she welcomes him into her gown
Yes, and mark how the stranger's cold armour
Dissolves like a star falling down
Why trade this vision for desire
When you may have them both
You will never see a man this naked
I will never hold a woman this close

Leonard Cohen,"Now the Swan it floated on the English river
Ah the Rose of High Romance it opened wide
A sun tanned woman yearned me through the summer
And the judges watched us from the other side

I told my mother ""Mother I must leave you
Preserve my room but do not shed a tear
Should rumour of a shabby ending reach you
It was half my fault and half the atmosphere""

But the Rose I sickened with a scarlet fever
And the Swan I tempted with a sense of shame
She said at last I was her finest lover
And if she withered I would be to blame

The judges said you missed it by a fraction
Rise up and brace your troops for the attack
Ah the dreamers ride against the men of action
Oh see the men of action falling back

But I lingered on her thighs a fatal moment
I kissed her lips as though I thirsted still
My falsity had stung me like a hornet
The poison sank and it paralyzed my will

I could not move to warn all the younger soldiers
That they had been deserted from above
So on battlefields from here to Barcelona
I'm listed with the enemies of love

And long ago she said ""I must be leaving,
Ah but keep my body here to lie upon
You can move it up and down and when I'm sleeping
Run some wire through that Rose and wind the Swan""

So daily I renew my idle duty
I touch her here and there, I know my place
I kiss her open mouth and I praise her beauty
And people call me traitor to my face",The Traitor

Abandoned to beauty and pride
The thorn of the night in your bosom
The spear of the age in your side
Lost in the rages of fragrance
Lost in the rags of remorse
Lost in the waves of a sickness
That loosens the high silver nerves

Oh chosen love, Oh frozen love
Oh tangle of matter and ghost
Oh darling of angels, demons and saints
And the whole broken-hearted host
Gentle this soul

And come forth from the cloud of unknowing
And kiss the cheek of the moon
The New Jerusalem glowing
Why tarry all night in the ruin
And leave no word of discomfort
And leave no observer to mourn
But climb on your tears and be silent
Like a rose on its ladder of thorns

Oh chosen love, Oh frozen love

Then lay your rose on the fire
The fire give up to the sun
The sun give over to splendour
In the arms of the high holy one
For the holy one dreams of a letter
Dreams of a letter's death
Oh bless thee continuous stutter
Of the word being made into flesh

Just when all the bills are due

Tho' the rain and the sun come through 
And springtime starts but then it stops 
In the name of something new 
And all the senses rise against this 
Coming back to you 

And they're handing down my sentence now 
And I know what I must do 
Another mile of silence while I'm 
Coming back to you 

There are many in your life 
And many still to be 
Since you are a shining light 
There's many that you'll see 
But I have to deal with envy 
When you choose the precious few 
Who've left their pride on the other side of 
Coming back to you 

Even in your arms I know 
I'll never get it right

Let me feel you moving like they do in Babylon

Dance me very tenderly and dance me very long

Dance me to the children who are asking to be born
Dance me through the curtains that our kisses have outworn
Raise a tent of shelter now, though every thread is torn

And a woman cannot follow him
Although she knows the way

But spirit, spirit cannot pass

Your father's gone a-hunting
For the beast he cannot bind
And he leaves a baby sleeping
And his blessings all behind

Your father's gone a-hunting
And he's lost his lucky charm
And he's lost the guardian heart

I will sing to you

All your praises they shall ring
If it be your will
To let me sing

From this broken hill
All your praises they shall ring
If it be your will
To let me sing

If it be your will
If there is a choice
Let the rivers fill
Let the hills rejoice
Let your mercy spill
On all these burning hearts in hell
If it be your will
To make us well

And draw us near
And bind us tight
All your children here
In their rags of light
In our rags of light
All dressed to kill
And end this night
If it be your will

If it be your will",If It Be Your Will
Leonard Cohen,"How many times did you call me
And I knew it was late
I left everybody
But I never went straight
I don't claim to be guilty
But I do understand
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand

Now my heart's like a blister
From doing what I do
If the moon has a sister
It's got to be you
I'm going to miss you forever
Tho' it's not what I planned
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand

Now the deal has been dirty
Since dirty began
I'm not asking for mercy
Not from the man
You just don't ask for mercy
While you're still on the stand
There s a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand

I don't claim to be guilty
Guilty's too grand
There s a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand

That's all I can say, baby
That's all I can say
It wasn't for nothing
They put me away
I fell with my angel
Down the chain of command
There s a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand",The Law
Leonard Cohen,"I went down to the place where I knew she lay waiting
Under the marble and the snow
I said, Mother I'm frightened, the thunder and the lightning
I'll never come through this alone
She said, I'll be with you, my shawl wrapped around you
My hand on your head when you go
And the night came on, it was very calm

I wanted the night to go on and on
But she said, go back, go back to the world
We were fighting in Egypt when they signed this agreement
That nobody else had to die
There was this terrible sound, my father went down
With a terrible wound in his side
He said, try to go on, take my books, take my gun
Remember, my son, how they lied
And the night comes on, it's very calm
I'd like to pretend that my father was wrong
But you don't want to lie, not to the young

We were locked in this kitchen, I took to religion
And I wondered how long she would stay
I needed so much to have nothing to touch
I've always been greedy that way
But my son and my daughter climbed out of the water
Crying, Papa, you promised to play
And they lead me away to the great surprise
It's Papa, don't peek, Papa, cover your eyes
And they hide, they hide in the world

Now I look for her always, I'm lost in this calling
I'm tied to the threads of some prayer
Saying when will she summon me, when will she come to me
What must I do to prepare?
When she bends to my longing like a willow, like a fountain
She stands in the luminous air
And the night comes on, it's very calm
I lie in her arms and says when I'm gone
I'll be yours, yours for a song

Now the crickets are singing, the vesper bells ringing
The cat's curled asleep in his chair
I'll go down to Bill's Bar, I can make it that far
And I'll see if my friends are still there
Yes, and here's to the few, who forgive what you do
And the fewer who don't even care
And the night comes on, it's very calm
I want to cross over, I want to go home
But she says, Go back, go back to the world",Night Comes On
Leonard Cohen,"I loved you for a long, long time
I know this love is real
It don't matter how it all went wrong
That don't change the way I feel
And I can't believe that time is
Gonna heal this wound I'm speaking of
There ain't no cure, there ain't no cure, there ain't no cure for love

I'm aching for you baby
I can't pretend I'm not
I need to see you naked
In your body and your thought
I've got you like a habit
And I'll never get enough
There ain't no cure, there ain't no cure, there ain't no cure for love

(There ain't no cure for love)
(There ain't no cure for love)
All the rocket ships are climbing through the sky
The holy books are open wide
The doctors working day and night
But they'll never ever find that cure for love
(There ain't no drink, no drug) ah, tell them, angels
(There's nothing pure enough to be a cure for love)

I see you in the subway and I see you on the bus
I see you lying down with me, I see you waking up
I see your hand, I see your hair
Your bracelets and your brush
And I call to you, I call to you
But I don't call soft enough
There ain't no cure, there ain't no cure, there ain't no cure for love

I walked into this empty church, I had no place else to go
When the sweetest voice I ever heard whispered to my soul
I don't need to be forgiven for loving you so much
It's written in the scriptures
It's written there in blood
And I even heard the angels declare it from above
There ain't no cure, there ain't no cure, there ain't no cure for love

(There ain't no cure for love)
(There ain't no cure for love)
All the rocket ships are climbing through the sky
The holy books are open wide
The doctors working day and night
But they'll never-ever find that (cure for love), that cure for love
(That cure for love)
(There ain't no cure for love)
(No cure for love, there ain't no cure for love)",Ain't No Cure for Love
Leonard Cohen,"Everybody knows that the dice are loaded
Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed
Everybody knows the war is over
Everybody knows the good guys lost
Everybody knows the fight was fixed
The poor stay poor, the rich get rich
That's how it goes

Everybody knows that the boat is leaking
Everybody knows that the captain lied
Everybody got this broken feeling

And everybody knows that the Plague is coming
Everybody knows that it's moving fast
Everybody knows that the naked man and woman
Are just a shining artifact of the past
Everybody knows the scene is dead
But there's gonna be a meter on your bed
That will disclose
What everybody knows

And everybody knows that you're in trouble
Everybody knows what you've been through
From the bloody cross on top of Calvary
To the beach of Malibu
Everybody knows it's coming apart
Take one last look at this Sacred Heart
Before it blows

Leonard Cohen,"I stumbled out of bed
I got ready for the struggle
I smoked a cigarette
And I tightened up my gut
I said this can't be me
Must be my double
And I can't forget, I can't forget
I can't forget but I don't remember what
I'm burning up the road
I'm heading down to Phoenix
I got this old address
Of someone that I knew
It was high and fine and free
Ah, you should have seen us
And I can't forget, I can't forget
I can't forget but I don't remember who

I'll be there today
With a big bouquet of cactus
I got this rig that runs on memories
And I promise, cross my heart,
They'll never catch us
But if they do, just tell them it was me

Yeah I loved you all my life
And that's how I want to end it
The summer's almost gone
The winter's tuning up
Yeah, the summer's gone
But a lot goes on forever

I can't forget but I don't remember what",I Can't Forget
Leonard Cohen,"If you want a lover
I'll do anything you ask me to
And if you want another kind of love
I'll wear a mask for you
If you want a partner, take my hand, or
If you want to strike me down in anger
Here I stand
I'm your man

If you want a boxer
I will step into the ring for you
And if you want a doctor
I'll examine every inch of you
If you want a driver, climb inside
Or if you want to take me for a ride
You know you can
I'm your man

Ah, the moon's too bright
The chain's too tight
The beast won't go to sleep
I've been running through these promises to you
That I made and I could not keep
Ah, but a man never got a woman back
Not by begging on his knees
Or I'd crawl to you baby and I'd fall at your feet
And I'd howl at your beauty like a dog in heat
And I'd claw at your heart, and I'd tear at your sheet
I'd say please (please)
I'm your man

And if you've got to sleep a moment on the road
I will steer for you
And if you want to work the street alone
I'll disappear for you
If you want a father for your child
Or only want to walk with me a while across the sand
I'm your man

If you want a lover
I'll do anything you ask me to
And if you want another kind of love
I'll wear a mask for you",I'm Your Man
Leonard Cohen,"Can you tell me why the bells are ringing?
Nothing's happened in a million years
I've been sitting here since Wednesday morning
Wednesday morning can't believe my ears
Jazz police are looking through my folders
Jazz police are talking to my niece
Jazz police have got their final orders
Jazzer, drop your axe, it's Jazz police!

Jesus taken serious by the many
Jesus taken joyous by a few
Jazz police are paid by J. Paul Getty
Jazzers paid by J. Paul Getty II

Jazz police I hear you calling
Jazz police I feel so blue
Jazz police I think I'm falling,
I'm falling for you

Wild as any freedom loving racist
I applaud the actions of the chief
Tell me now oh beautiful and spacious
Am I in trouble with the Jazz police?

Jazz police are looking through my folders 

They will never understand our culture
They'll never understand the Jazz police
Jazz police are working for my mother
Blood is thicker margarine than grease

Let me be somebody I admire
Let me be that muscle down the street
Stick another turtle on the fire
Guys like me are mad for turtle meat

I'm falling for you",Jazz Police
Leonard Cohen,"Now in Vienna there are ten pretty women
There's a shoulder where Death comes to cry
There's a lobby with nine hundred windows
There's a tree where the doves go to die
There's a piece that was torn from the morning
And it hangs in the Gallery of Frost

I, I-I-I
Take this waltz, take this waltz
Take this waltz with the clamp on its jaws

Oh, I want you, I want you, I want you
On a chair with a dead magazine
In the cave at the tip of the lilly
In some hallway where love's never been
On a bed where the moon has been sweating
In a cry filled with footsteps and sand

I, I-I-I
Take this waltz, take this waltz
Take its broken waist in your hand

This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz
With its very own breath of brandy and Death
Dragging its tail in the sea

There's a concert hall in Vienna
Where your mouth had a thousand reviews
There's a bar where the boys have stopped talking
They've been sentenced to death by the blues
Ah, but who is it climbs to your picture
With a garland of freshly cut tears?

I, I-I-I
Take this waltz, take this waltz
Take this waltz, it's been dying for years

There's an attic where children are playing
Where I've got to lie down with you soon
In a dream of Hungarian lanterns
In the mist of some sweet afternoon
And I'll see what you've chained to your sorrow
All your sheep and your lillies of snow

I, I-I-I
Take this waltz, take this waltz
With its ""I'll never forget you, you know!""

This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz
With its very own breath of brandy and Death
Dragging its tail in the sea

And I'll dance with you in Vienna
I'll be wearing a river's disguise
The hyacinth wild on my shoulder
My mouth on the dew of your thighs
And I'll bury my soul in a scrapbook
With the photographs there, and the moss
And I'll yield to the flood of your beauty
My cheap violin and my cross
And you'll carry me down on your dancing
To the pools that you lift on your wrist
Oh my love, oh my love
Take this waltz, take this waltz
It's yours now, it's all that there is

Leonard Cohen,"Well, my friends are gone and my hair is grey
I ache in the places where I used to play
And I'm crazy for love but I'm not coming on
I'm just paying my rent every day in the Tower of Song

I said to Hank Williams, how lonely does it get?
Hank Williams hasn't answered yet
But I hear him coughing all night long
Oh, a hundred floors above me in the Tower of Song

I was born like this, I had no choice
I was born with the gift of a golden voice
And twenty-seven angels from the Great Beyond
They tied me to this table right here in the Tower of Song

So you can stick your little pins in that voodoo doll
I'm very sorry, baby, doesn't look like me at all
I'm standing by the window where the light is strong
Ah, they don't let a woman kill you, not in the Tower of Song

Now, you can say that I've grown bitter but of this you may be sure
The rich have got their channels in the bedrooms of the poor
And there's a mighty judgment coming, but I may be wrong
You see, you hear these funny voices in the Tower of Song

I see you standing on the other side
I don't know how the river got so wide
I loved you baby, way back when
And all the bridges are burning that we might have crossed
But I feel so close to everything that we lost
We'll never, we'll never have to lose it again

Now I bid you farewell, I don't know when I'll be back
They're moving us tomorrow to that tower down the track
But you'll be hearing from me baby, long after I'm gone
I'll be speaking to you sweetly from a window in the Tower of Song

Yeah, my friends are gone and my hair is gray
I ache in the places where I used to play
And I'm crazy for love but I'm not coming on

Leonard Cohen,"Suddenly the night has grown colder
The god of love preparing to depart
Alexandra hoisted on his shoulder,
They slip between the sentries of the heart

Upheld by the simplicities of pleasure
They gain the light, they formlessly entwine
And radiant beyond your widest measure
They fall among the voices and the wine

It's not a trick, your senses all deceiving
A fitful dream, the morning will exhaust
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost

Even though she sleeps upon your satin
Even though she wakes you with a kiss
Do not say the moment was imagined
Do not stoop to strategies like this

As someone long prepared for this to happen
Go firmly to the window, drink it in
Exquisite music Alexandra laughing
Your first commitments tangible again

And you who had the honor of her evening,
And by the honor had your own restored
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Alexandra leaving with her Lord

Even though she sleeps upon your satin
Even though she wakes you with a kiss
Do not say the moment was imagined
Do not stoop to strategies like this

As someone long prepared for the occasion
In full command of every plan you wrecked
Do not choose a coward's explanation
that hides behind the cause and the effect

And you who were bewildered by a meaning
Whose code was broken, crucifix uncrossed
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost

Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost",Take This Waltz [Album Version] [Version]

You can see it, you can taste it,
And she comes to you light as the breeze.
Now you can drink it or you can nurse it,
It don't matter how you worship
As long as you're
Down on your knees.
So I knelt there at the delta,
At the alpha and the omega,
At the cradle of the river and the seas.
And like a blessing come from heaven
For something like a second
I was healed and my heart
Was at ease.

O baby I waited
So long for your kiss
For something to happen,
Oh something like this.

And you're weak and you're harmless
And you're sleeping in your harness
And the wind going wild
In the trees,
And it ain't exactly prison
But you'll never be forgiven
For whatever you've done
With the keys.

O baby I waited 

It's dark now and it's snowing
O my love I must be going,
The river has started to freeze.
And I'm sick of pretending
I'm broken from bending
I've lived too long on my knees.

Then she dances so graceful
And your heart's hard and hateful
And she's naked
But that's just a tease.
And you turn in disgust
From your hatred and from your love
And comes to you
Light as the breeze.

O baby I waited

There's blood on every bracelet
You can see it, you can taste it,
And it's please baby
Please baby please.
And she says, drink deeply, pilgrim
But don't forget there's still a woman
Beneath this
Resplendent chemise.

So I knelt there at the delta,
At the alpha and the omega,
I knelt there like one who believes.
And the blessings come from heaven
And for something like a second
I'm cured and my heart
Is at ease",Light as the Breeze
Leonard Cohen,"The woman in blue, she's asking for revenge
The man in white -- that's you -- says he has no friends

And the trees are burning in your promised land
And there are no letters in the mailbox
And there are no grapes upon the vine
And there are no chocolates in the boxes anymore
And there are no diamonds in the mine

Well, you tell me that your lover has a broken limb
You say you're kind of restless now and it's on account of him
Well, I saw the man in question, it was just the other night
He was eating up a lady where the lions and Christians fight

And there are no letters in the mailbox 
And there are no grapes upon the vine
And there are no chocolates in the boxes anymore
And there are no diamonds in the mine 

(You tell them now) 

Ah, there is no comfort in the covens of the witch
Some very clever doctor went and sterilized the bitch
And the only man of energy, yes the revolution's pride
He trained a hundred women just to kill an unborn child

And there are no letters in the mailbox
Oh no, there are no, no grapes upon your vine 

And there are, there are no chocolates in your boxes anymore
And there are no diamonds in your mine
And there are no letters in the mailbox 
And there are no grapes upon the vine 
And there are no chocolates in your boxes anymore 
And there are no diamonds in your mine",Diamonds in the Mine

I closed the book on us, at least a hundred times. 
I'd wake up every morning by your side. 

The years go by, you lose your pride. 
The baby's crying, so you do not go outside, 
And all your work it's right before your eyes. 

Goodnight, my darling, I hope you're satisfied, 
The bed is kind of narrow, but my arms are open wide. 
And here's a man still working for your smile.",I Tried to Leave You

The one I'm using now it's covered up
With fear and filth and cowardice and shame

Yes and lover, lover, lover
Lover, lover, lover, lover
Come back to me

I meant it as a kind of trial
You can use it for a weapon
Or to make some woman smile""

""Then let me start again,"" I cried
""Please let me start again
I want a face that's fair this time
I want a spirit that is calm""

""I never walked away
It was you who built the temple
it was you who covered up my face""

May it rise up pure and free
May it be a shield for you
A shield against the enemy

[Chorus: x2]","Lover, Lover, Lover"
Leonard Cohen,"I lit a thin green candle to make you jealous of me,
But the room just filled up with mosquitoes, they heard that my body was free
Then I took the dust of a long sleepless night and I put it in your little shoe 
And then I confess that I tortured the dress that you wore for the world to look through

I showed my heart to the doctor. He said I'd just have to quit
Then he wrote himself a prescription, your name was mentioned in it 
Then he locked himself in a library shelf with the details of our honeymoon
And I hear from the nurse that he's gotten much worse and his practice is all in a ruin

I heard of a saint who had loved you, I studied all night in his school 
He taught that the duty of lovers is to tarnish the golden rule 
And just when I was sure that his teachings were pure he drowned himself in the pool
His body is gone but back here on the lawn his spirit continues to drool

An Eskimo showed me a movie he'd recently taken of you 
The poor man could hardly stop shivering, his lips and his fingers were blue
I suppose that he froze when the wind tore off your clothes 
And I guess he just never got warm, but you stand there so nice in your blizzard of ice 
Oh please let me come into the storm",One of Us Cannot Be Wrong
Leonard Cohen,"There is a war between the rich and poor, 
A war between the man and the woman. 
There is a war between the ones who say there is a war 
And the ones who say there isn't. 
Why don't you come on back to the war, that's right, get in it, 
Why don't you come on back to the war, it's just beginning. 

Well I live here with a woman and a child, 
The situation makes me kind of nervous. 
Yes, I rise up from her arms, she says ""I guess you call this love"" 
I call it service. 

Why don't you come on back to the war, don't be a tourist, 
Why don't you come on back to the war, before it hurts us, 
Why don't you come on back to the war, let's all get nervous. 

You cannot stand what I've become, 
You much prefer the gentleman I was before. 
I was so easy to defeat, I was so easy to control, 
I didn't even know there was a war. 

Why don't you come on back to the war, don't be embarrassed, 
Why don't you come on back to the war, you can still get married. 

There is a war between the rich and poor, 
A war between the man and the woman. 
There is a war between the left and right, 
A war between the black and white, 
A war between the odd and the even. 

Why don't you come on back to the war, pick up your tiny burden, 
Why don't you come on back to the war, let's all get even, 
Why don't you come on back to the war, can't you hear me speaking?",There Is a War
Leonard Cohen,"Sometimes I find I get to thinking of the past.
We swore to each other then that our love would surely last.
You kept right on loving, I went on a fast,
Now I am too thin and your love is too vast.
But I know from your eyes
And I know from your smile
That tonight will be fine,
Will be fine, will be fine, will be fine
For a while.

I choose the rooms that I live in with care,
The windows are small and the walls almost bare,
There's only one bed and there's only one prayer;
I listen all night for your step on the stair.
But I know from your eyes
And I know from your smile
That tonight will be fine,
Will be fine, will be fine, will be fine
For a while.

Oh sometimes I see her undressing for me,
She's the soft naked lady love meant her to be
And she's moving her body so brave and so free.
If I've got to remember that's a fine memory.
And I know from her eyes
And I know from her smile
That tonight will be fine,
Will be fine, will be fine, will be fine
For a while.",Tonight Will Be Fine
Leonard Cohen,"And who by fire?
Who by water?
Who in the sunshine?
Who in the night time?
Who by high ordeal?
Who by common trial?
Who in your merry merry month of May?
Who by very slow decay?
And who shall I say is calling?
(Who shall I say is calling?)

And who in her lonely slip?
Who by barbiturate?
Who in these realms of love?
Who by something blunt?
Who by avalanche?
Who by powder?
Who for his greed?
Who for his hunger?
And who shall I say is calling?
(Who shall I say is calling?)

And who by brave assent?
Who by accident?
Who in solitude?
Who in this mirror?
Who by his lady's command?
Who by his own hand?
Who in mortal chains?
Who in power?
And who shall I say is calling?

Leonard Cohen,"Now the flames they followed joan of arc
As she came riding through the dark;
No moon to keep her armour bright,
No man to get her through this very smoky night.
She said, I'm tired of the war,
I want the kind of work I had before,
A wedding dress or something white
To wear upon my swollen appetite.

Well, I'm glad to hear you talk this way,
You know I've watched you riding every day
And something in me yearns to win
Such a cold and lonesome heroine.
And who are you? she sternly spoke
To the one beneath the smoke.
Why, I'm fire, he replied,
And I love your solitude, I love your pride.

Then fire, make your body cold,
I'm going to give you mine to hold,
Saying this she climbed inside
To be his one, to be his only bride.
And deep into his fiery heart
He took the dust of joan of arc,
And high above the wedding guests
He hung the ashes of her wedding dress.

It was deep into his fiery heart
He took the dust of joan of arc,
And then she clearly understood
If he was fire, oh then she must be wood.
I saw her wince, I saw her cry,
I saw the glory in her eye.
Myself I long for love and light,
But must it come so cruel, and oh so bright?",Joan of Arc
Leonard Cohen,"The birds they sang
At the break of day
Start again
I heard them say
Don't dwell on what
Has passed away
Or what is yet to be
Yeah the wars they will
Be fought again
The holy dove
She will be caught again
Bought and sold
And bought again
The dove is never free

Ring the bells (ring the bells) that still can ring
Forget your perfect offering
There is a crack in everything (there is a crack in everything)
That's how the light gets in

We asked for signs
The signs were sent
The birth betrayed
The marriage spent
Yeah the widowhood
Of every government
Signs for all to see

I can't run no more
With that lawless crowd
While the killers in high places
Say their prayers out loud
But they've summoned, they've summoned up
A thundercloud
And they're going to hear from me

(Ring, ring, ring, ring)
Ring the bells that still can ring

Forget your perfect offering
There is a crack, a crack in everything (there is a crack in everything)
That's how the light gets in

You can add up the parts
You won't have the sum
You can strike up the march
There is no drum
Every heart, every heart to love will come
But like a refugee

(Ring, ring, ring, ring)
Ring the bells that still can ring
Forget your perfect offering
There is a crack, a crack in everything (there is a crack in everything)
That's how the light gets in
Ring the bells that still can ring (ring the bells that still can ring)
Forget your perfect offering
There is a crack, a crack in everything (there is a crack in everything)

Leonard Cohen,"Ah we're drinking and we're dancing
And the band is really happening
And the Johnny Walker wisdom running high
And my very sweet companion
She's the angel of compassion
She's rubbing half the world against her thigh
And every drinker every dancer
Lifts a happy face to thank her
The fiddler fiddles something so sublime
All the women tear their blouses off
And the men they dance on the polka-dots
And it's partner found, it's partner lost
And it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops
It's closing time

Ah we're lonely, we're romantic
And the cider's laced with acid
And the holy spirit's crying, where's the beef?
And the moon is swimming naked
And the summer night is fragrant
With a mighty expectation of relief
So we struggle and we stagger
Down the snakes and up the ladder
To the tower where the blessed hours chime
And I swear it happened just like this
A sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss
The gates of love they budged an inch
I can't say much has happened since
But closing time

Closing time

I loved you for your beauty
But that doesn't make a fool of me
You were in it for your beauty too
And I loved you for your body
There's a voice that sounds like god to me
Declaring, (declaring) declaring,declaring that your body's really you
And I loved you when our love was blessed
And I love you now there's nothing left
But sorrow and a sense of overtime
And I missed you since the place got wrecked
And I just don't care what happens next
Looks like freedom but it feels like death
It's something in between, I guess
It's closing time

Yeah I missed you since the place got wrecked
By the winds of change and the weeds of sex
Looks like freedom but it feels like death
It's something in between, I guess
It's closing time

Yeah we're drinking and we're dancing
But there's nothing really happening
And the place is dead as heaven on a Saturday night
And my very close companion
Gets me fumbling gets me laughing
She's a hundred but she's wearing
Something tight
And I lift my glass to the awful truth
Which you can't reveal to the ears of youth
Except to say it isn't worth a dime
And the whole damn place goes crazy twice
And it's once for the devil and once for Christ
But the boss don't like these dizzy heights
We're busted in the blinding lights

Leonard Cohen,"Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
Dance me through the panic 'til I'm gathered safely in
Lift me like an olive branch and be my homeward dove
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love

Oh let me see your beauty when the witnesses are gone
Let me feel you moving like they do in Babylon
Show me slowly what I only know the limits of
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the wedding now, dance me on and on
Dance me very tenderly and dance me very long
We're both of us beneath our love, we're both of us above
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love

Dance me to the children who are asking to be born
Dance me through the curtains that our kisses have outworn
Raise a tent of shelter now, though every thread is torn
Dance me to the end of love

Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
Dance me through the panic till I'm gathered safely in
Touch me with your naked hand or touch me with your glove

My mirrored room, my secret life
It's lonely here,
There's no one left to torture
Give me absolute control
Over every living soul
And lie beside me, baby

Give me crack and anal sex
Take the only tree that's left
And stuff it up the hole
In your culture
Give me back the Berlin wall
Give me Stalin and St. Paul

You never will, you never did
I'm the little Jew
Who wrote the Bible
I've seen the nations rise and fall
I've heard their stories, heard them all
But love's the only engine of survival
Your servant here, he has been told
To say it clear, to say it cold
It's over, it ain't going
Any further
And now the wheels of heaven stop
You feel the devil's riding crop
Get ready for the future

There'll be the breaking of the ancient
Western code
Your private life will suddenly explode
There'll be phantoms
There'll be fires on the road
And the white man dancing
You'll see a woman
Hanging upside down
Her features covered by her fallen gown
And all the lousy little poets
Coming round
Tryin' to sound like Charlie Manson
And the white man dancin'

Give me back the Berlin wall
Give me Stalin and St. Paul
Give me Christ or give me Hiroshima
Destroy another fetus now

Leonard Cohen,"It`s going to happen very soon. 
The great event which will end the horror. 
Which will end the sorrow. 
Next Tuesday, when the sun goes down,
I will play the Moonlight Sonata backwards. 

This will reverse the effects of the world`s mad plunge into suffering, 
For the last 200 million years. 
What a lovely night that would be. 
What a sigh of relief, as the senile robins become bright red again, 

And the retired nightingales, 
Pick up their dusty tails, 
And assert the majesty of creation!",The Great Event [#]
Leonard Cohen,"I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this
The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you
To a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
There's a blaze of light
In every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though
It all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

Leonard Cohen,"Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river
You can hear the boats go by, you can spend the night forever
And you know that she's half-crazy but that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges that come all the way from China
And just when you mean to tell her that you have no love to give her
Then he gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer that you've always been her lover

And you want to travel with her, and you want to travel blind
And you know that she will trust you
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind

And Jesus was a sailor when he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching from his lonely wooden tower
And when he knew for certain only drowning men could see him
He said all men will be sailors then until the sea shall free them
But he himself was broken, long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human, he sank beneath your wisdom like a stone

And you want to travel with him, and you want to travel blind
And you think you maybe you'll trust him
For he's touched your perfect body with her mind

Now, Suzanne takes your hand and she leads you to the river
She's wearing rags and feathers from Salvation Army counters
And the sun pours down like honey on our lady of the harbor
And she shows you where to look among the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed, there are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love and they wil lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds her mirror

And you want to travel with her, and you want to travel blind
And you know that you can trust her
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind",Suzanne [Live]

If I, if I have been unkind
I hope that you can just let it go by
If I, if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you

Like a baby, stillborn
Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me
But I swear by this song
And by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee
I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch
He said to me, you must not ask for so much
And a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door
She cried to me, hey, why not ask for more?

Oh like a bird on the wire

Leonard Cohen,"Suddenly the night has grown colder
The god of love preparing to depart
Alexandra hoisted on his shoulder,
They slip between the sentries of the heart

Upheld by the simplicities of pleasure
They gain the light, they formlessly entwine
And radiant beyond your widest measure
They fall among the voices and the wine

It's not a trick, your senses all deceiving
A fitful dream, the morning will exhaust
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost

Even though she sleeps upon your satin
Even though she wakes you with a kiss
Do not say the moment was imagined
Do not stoop to strategies like this

As someone long prepared for this to happen
Go firmly to the window, drink it in
Exquisite music Alexandra laughing
Your first commitments tangible again

And you who had the honor of her evening,
And by the honor had your own restored
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Alexandra leaving with her Lord

Even though she sleeps upon your satin
Even though she wakes you with a kiss
Do not say the moment was imagined
Do not stoop to strategies like this

As someone long prepared for the occasion
In full command of every plan you wrecked
Do not choose a coward's explanation
that hides behind the cause and the effect

And you who were bewildered by a meaning
Whose code was broken, crucifix uncrossed
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost

Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost",Alexandra Leaving

I tuned the old banjo
I'm wanted at the traffic jam

Leonard Cohen,"By the rivers dark
I wandered on.
I lived my life
In Babylon.

And I did forget
My holy song
And I had no strength
In Babylon.

By the rivers dark
Where I could not see
Who was waiting there
Who was hunting me.

And he cut my lip
And he cut my heart.
So I could not drink
From the river dark.

And he covered me,
And I saw within,
My lawless heart
And my wedding ring,

I did not know
And I could not see
Who was waiting there,
Who was hunting me.

By the rivers dark
I panicked on.
I belonged at last
To Babylon.

Then he struck my heart
With a deadly force,
And he said, â??This heart
It is not yours.'

And he gave the wind
My wedding ring
And he circled us
With everything.

By the rivers dark,
In a wounded dawn,
I live my life
In Babylon.

Though I take my song
From a withered limb,
Both song and tree,
They sing for him.

Be the truth unsaid
And the blessing gone,
If I forget
My Babylon.

And I could not see
Who was waiting there,
Who was hunting me.

In my secret life
In my secret life
In my secret life

I saw you this morning
You were moving so fast
Can't seem to loosen my grip
On the past
And I miss you so much
There's no one in sight
And we're still making love
In my secret life
In my secret life

I smile when I'm angry
I cheat and I lie
I do what I have to do
To get by
But I know what is wrong
And I know what is right
And I'd die for the truth
In my secret life
In my secret life

Hold on, hold on, my brother
My sister, hold on tight
I finally got my orders
I'll be marching through the morning
Marching through the night
Moving cross the borders
Of my secret life

Looked through the paper
Makes you wanna cry
Nobody cares if the people
Live or die
And the dealer wants you thinking
That it's either black or white
Thank God it's not that simple
In my secret life

I bite my lip
I buy what I'm told
From the latest hit
To the wisdom of old
But I'm always alone
And my heart is like ice

Knowing as I do,

What I really think of you.

That wealth has set apart
For the Christ who has not risen,
From the caverns of the heart

Leonard Cohen,"The light came through the window
Straight from the sun above
And so inside my little room
There plunged the rays of love

In streams of light I clearly saw
The dust you seldom see,
Out of which the nameless makes
A name for one like me

I'll try to say a little more
Love went on and on
Until it reached an open door
Then love itself
Love itself was gone

All busy in the sunlight
The flecks did float and dance
And I was tumbled up with them
In formless circumstance

I'll try to say a little more
Love went on and on
Until it reached an open door
Then love itself
Love itself was gone

Then I came back from where I'd been
My room, it looked the same
But there was nothing left between
The nameless and the name

All busy in the sunlight
The flecks did float and dance
And I was tumbled up with them
In formless circumstance

I'll try to say a little more
Love went on and on
Until it reached an open door
Then love itself
Love itself was gone
Love itself
Love itself was gone",Love Itself

How come you called me here tonight?
How come you bother
With my heart at all?
You raise me up in grace,
Then you put me in a place,

Too late to fix another drink

I tried to love you my way,
But I couldn't make it hold.

And I do what I am told.

The odds are there to beat
You win a while and then it's done
Your little winning streak
And summoned now to deal
With your invincible defeat
You live your life as if it's real
A thousand kisses deep

I'm turning tricks, I'm getting fixed
I'm back on boogie street
You lose your grip and then you slip
Into the masterpiece
And maybe I had miles to drive
And promises to keep
You ditch it all to stay alive
A thousand kisses deep

And sometimes when the night is slow
The wretched and the meek
We gather up our hearts and go
A thousand kisses deep

Confined to sex we pressed against
The limits of the sea
I saw there were no oceans left
For scavengers like me
I made it to the forward deck
I blessed our remnant fleet
And then consented to be wrecked
A thousand kisses deep

I'm turning tricks I'm getting fixed
I'm back on boogie street
I guess they won't exchange the gifts
That you were meant to keep
And quiet is the thought of you
The file on you complete
Except what we forgot to do
A thousand kisses deep

And sometimes when the night is slow
The wretched and the meek
We gather up our hearts and go
A thousand kisses deep

The ponies run, the girls are young

You kept me from believing
Until you let me know:

That I am not the one who loves

You forbid delivery.

And when the hunger for your touch
Rises from the hunger,

Leonard Cohen,"It's coming through a hole in the air
From those nights in Tiananmen Square
It's coming from the feel
That this ain't exactly real
Or it's real, but it ain't exactly there
From the wars against disorder
From the sirens night and day
From the fires of the homeless
From the ashes of the gay
Democracy is coming to the USA
It's coming through a crack in the wall
On a visionary flood of alcohol
From the staggering account
Of the Sermon on the Mount
Which I don't pretend to understand at all
It's coming from the silence
On the dock of the bay,
From the brave, the bold, the battered
Heart of Chevrolet
Democracy is coming to the USA

It's coming from the sorrow in the street
The holy places where the races meet
From the homicidal bitchin'
That goes down in every kitchen
To determine who will serve and who will eat
From the wells of disappointment
Where the women kneel to pray
For the grace of God in the desert here
And the desert far away:
Democracy is coming to the USA

Sail on, sail on
Oh mighty ship of State
To the shores of need
Past the reefs of greed
Through the Squalls of hate
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on

It's coming to America first
The cradle of the best and of the worst
It's here they got the range
And the machinery for change
And it's here they got the spiritual thirst
It's here the family's broken
And it's here the lonely say
That the heart has got to open
In a fundamental way
Democracy is coming to the USA

It's coming from the women and the men
Oh baby, we'll be making love again
We'll be going down so deep
The river's going to weep,
And the mountain's going to shout Amen
It's coming like the tidal flood
Beneath the lunar sway
Imperial, mysterious
In amorous array
Democracy is coming to the USA

Sail on, sail on
O mighty ship of State
To the shores of need
Past the reefs of greed
Through the squalls of hate
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on

I'm sentimental, if you know what I mean
I love the country but I can't stand the scene
And I'm neither left or right
I'm just staying home tonight
Getting lost in that hopeless little screen
But I'm stubborn as those garbage bags
As time cannot decay
I'm junk but I'm still holding up this little wild bouquet
Democracy is coming to the USA

Leonard Cohen,"I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel,
You were talking so brave and so sweet,
Giving me head on the unmade bed,
While the limousines wait in the street.
Those were the reasons and that was New York,
We were running for the money and the flesh.
And that was called love for the workers in song
Probably still is for those of them left.

Ah but you got away, didn't you babe,
You just turned your back on the crowd,
You got away, I never once heard you say,
I need you, I don't need you,
I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around.

I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were famous, your heart was a legend.
You told me again you preferred handsome men
But for me you would make an exception.
And clenching your fist for the ones like us
Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty,
You fixed yourself, you said, ""Well never mind,
We are ugly but we have the music.""

And then you got away, didn't you babe

In their different ways

Look at me one last time.""

So we'll go no more a-roving
So late into the night,
Though the heart be still as loving,
And the moon be still as bright.
For the sword outwears its sheath,
And the soul outwears the breast,
And the heart must pause to breathe,
And love itself have rest.

And the day returns too soon,
Yet we'll go no more a-roving

So I could hear you singing
And it was sweet and it was good
And love was all beginning

The sun goes down behind a veil

To the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to see
I introduced him to my darling

My friend stole my sweetheart from me

Yes I lost my little darlin'
The night they were playing

And it's stronger than drink
And it's deeper than sorrow
This darkness she's left in my heart

Leonard Cohen,"[Dedicated to A. M. Klein (1909-1972)]

Hurt once and for all into silence.
A long pain ending without a song to prove it.
Who could stand beside you so close to Eden,
When you glinted in every eye the held-high
Razor, shivering every ram and son?
And now the silent loony bin, where
The shadows live in the rafters like
Day-weary bats,
Until the turning mind, a radar signal,
Lures them to exaggerate
Mountain-size on the white stone wall
Your tiny limp.
How can I leave you in such a house?
Are there no more saints and wizards
To praise their ways with pupils,
No more evil to stun with the slap
Of a wet red tongue?
Did you confuse the Messiah in a mirror
And rest because he had finally come?
Let me cry Help beside you, Teacher.
I have entered under this dark roof
As fearlessly as an honoured son
Enters his father's house.
",To a Teacher
Leonard Cohen,"I set out one night
When the tide was low
There were signs in the sky
But I did not know
I'd be caught in the grip
Of the undertow
Ditched on a beach
Where the sea hates to go
With a child in my arms
And a chill in my soul
And my heart the shape
Of a begging bowl
",Undertow
Leonard Cohen,"From bitter searching of the heart,
Quickened with passion and with pain
We rise to play a greater part.
This is the faith from which we start:
Men shall know commonwealth again
From bitter searching of the heart.
We loved the easy and the smart,
But now, with keener hand and brain,
We rise to play a greater part.
The lesser loyalties depart,
And neither race nor creed remain
From bitter searching of the heart.
Not steering by the venal chart
That tricked the mass for private gain,
We rise to play a greater part.
Reshaping narrow law and art
Whose symbols are the millions slain,
From bitter searching of the heart
We rise to play a greater part.

Leonard Cohen,"You came to me this morning
And you handled me like meat
You?d have to be a man to know
How good that feels, how sweet

My mirror twin, my next of kin
I?d know you in my sleep
And who but you would take me in 
A thousand kisses deep

I loved you when you opened
Like a lily to the heat
You see I?m just another snowman
Standing in the rain and sleet

Who loved you with his frozen love
His secondhand physique
With all he is and all he was
A thousand kisses deep

I know you had to lie to me
I know you had to cheat
To pose all hot and high
Behind the veils of sheer deceit

Our perfect porn aristocrat
So elegant and cheap
I?m old but I?m still into that
A thousand kisses deep

I?m good at love, I?m good at hate
It?s in between I freeze
Been working out but it?s too late 
(It?s been too late for years)

But you look good, you really do
They love you on the street
If you were here I?d kneel for you
A thousand kisses deep


The autumn moved across your skin
Got something in my eye
A light that doesn?t need to live 
And doesn?t need to die

A riddle in the book of love
Obscure and obsolete
And witnessed here in time and blood
A thousand kisses deep

But I?m still working with the wine
Still dancing cheek to cheek
The band is playing Auld Lang Syne
But the heart will not retreat

I ran with Diz, I sang with Ray
I never had their sweet
But once or twice they let me play
A thousand kisses deep

I loved you when you opened
Like a lily to the heat
You see I?m just another snowman
Standing in the rain and sleet

Who loved you with his frozen love
His secondhand physique
With all he is and all he was
A thousand kisses deep

But you don?t need to hear me now
And every word I speak
It counts against me anyhow
A thousand kisses deep

While the Limousines wait in the street

Those were the reason and that was New York
We were running for the money and the flesh
And that was called love for the workers in song
Probably still is for those of them left

Ah, but you got away, didn't you, babe?
You just turned your back on the crowd
You got away, I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you, I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around

I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were famous, your heart was a legend
You told me again you preferred handsome men
But for me you would make an exception

And clenching your fist for the ones like us
Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty
You fixed yourself, you said, ""Well never mind
We are ugly but we have the music""

And then you got away, didn't you, baby?
I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best
You got away, I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you, I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around

I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best
I can't keep track of each fallen robin
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
That's all, I don't even think of you that often","Chelsea Hotel [Royal Albert Hall, London, England, November 17, 2008]"

She's rubbing half the world against her thigh

Lifts a happy face to thank her
The fiddler fiddles something so sublime
All the women tear their blouses off
And the men they dance on the polka-dots
And it's partner found, it's partner lost

And the holy spirit's crying, where's the beef?
And the moon is swimming naked
And the summer night is fragrant
With a mighty expectation of relief
So we struggle and we stagger
Down the snakes and up the ladder

Leonard Cohen,"It's four in the morning, the end of December
I'm writing you now just to see if you're better
New York is cold, but I like where I'm living
There's music on Clinton Street all through the evening

I hear that you're building your little house deep in the desert
You're living for nothing now, I hope you're keeping some kind of record

Yes, and Jane came by with a lock of your hair
She said that you gave it to her
That night that you planned to go clear
Did you ever go clear?

Ah, the last time we saw you you looked so much older
Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder
You'd been to the station to meet every train, and
You came home without Lili Marlene

And you treated my woman to a flake of your life
And when she came back she was nobody's wife

Well I see you there with the rose in your teeth
One more thin gypsy thief
Well, I see Jane's awake
She sends her regards

And what can I tell you my brother, my killer
What can I possibly say?
I guess that I miss you, I guess I forgive you
I'm glad you stood in my way

If you ever come by here, for Jane or for me
Well, your enemy is sleeping, and his woman is free

Yes, and thanks, for the trouble you took from her eyes
I thought it was there for good so I never tried

And Jane came by with a lock of your hair
She said that you gave it to her
That night that you planned to go clear

Leonard Cohen,"The Partisan
When they poured across the border
I was cautioned to surrender,
This I could not do
I took my gun and vanished.

I have changed my name so often,
I've lost my wife and children
But I have many friends,
And some of them are with me.

An old woman gave us shelter,
Kept us hidden in the garret,
Then the soldiers came
She died without a whisper.

There were three of us this morning
I'm the only one this evening
But I must go on
The frontiers are my prison.

Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing,
Through the graves the wind is blowing,
Freedom soon will come,
Then we'll come from the shadows.

Les Allemands étaient chez moi,
Ils me dirent, ""résigne toi,""
Mais je n'ai pas peur,
J'ai repris mon âme.

The Germans were at my home
They said, ""sign yourself,""
But I am not afraid
I have retaken my soul.

J'ai changé cent fois de nom,
J'ai perdu femme et enfants
Mais j'ai tant d'amis
J'ai la france entière.

I've changed names a hundred times
I have lost wife and children
But I have so many friends
I have all of France

Un vieil homme dans un grenier
Pour la nuit nous a caché,
Les Allemands l'ont pris,
Il est mort sans surprise.

An old man, in an attic
Hid us for the night
The Germans captured him
He died without surprise.

Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing,
Through the graves the wind is blowing,
Freedom soon will come,
Then we'll come from the shadows.","The Partisan [Hartwall Arena, Helsinki, Finland, October 10, 2008]"
Leonard Cohen,"Baby, I've been waiting, 
I've been waiting night and day 
I didn't see the time, 
I waited half my life away 
There were lots of invitations 
And I know you sent me some
But I was waiting 
For the miracle, for the miracle to come 
I know you really loved me 
But, you see, my hands were tied 
I know it must have hurt you, 
It must have hurt your pride 
To have to stand beneath my window 
With your bugle and your drum
And me I'm up there waiting 
For the miracle, for the miracle to come 

Ah I don't believe you'd like it, 
You wouldn't like it here 
There ain't no entertainment 
And the judgments are severe 
The Maestro says it's Mozart 
But it sounds like bubble gum 
When you're waiting 
For the miracle, for the miracle to come 

Waiting for the miracle 
There's nothing left to do 
I haven't been this happy 
Since the end of World War II 

Nothing left to do 
When you know that you've been taken 
Nothing left to do 
When you're begging for a crumb 
Nothing left to do 
When you've got to go on waiting 
Waiting for the miracle to come 

I dreamed about you, baby 
It was just the other night 
Most of you was naked 
Ah but some of you was light 
The sands of time were falling 
From your fingers and your thumb
And you were waiting 
For the miracle, for the miracle to come 

Ah baby, let's get married
We've been alone too long 
Let's be alone together 
Let's see if we're that strong 
Yeah let's do something crazy, 
Something absolutely wrong 
While we're waiting 
For the miracle, for the miracle to come 

Nothing left to do 

When you've fallen on the highway 
And you're lying in the rain, 
And they ask you how you're doing 
Of course you'll say you can't complain 
If you're squeezed for information, 
That's when you've got to play it dumb
You just say you're out there waiting 
For the miracle, for the miracle to come","Waiting for the Miracle [HP Pavilion, San Jose, California, November 13"

Leonard Cohen,"I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were talking so brave and so free
Giving me head on the unmade bed 
While the limousines wait in the street 
And those were the reasons and that was New York 
I was running for the money and the flesh 
That was called love for the workers in song
It still is for those of us left. 
But you got away, didn't you, baby? 
You just threw it all to the crowd
You got away, they can't pay you now 
For making your sweet little song

You were wearing half your dress
I know you have to hate me
But could you hate me less?
I used up all my chances
And you’ll never take me back
But there ain’t no harm in asking
Could you cut me one more slack?

And bring it to me now

Come healing of the mind

And let the heavens hear it

Come healing of the spirit

And none of us deserving
The cruelty or the grace

O solitude of longing
Where love has been confined
Come healing of the body
Come healing of the mind

O see the darkness yielding
That tore the light apart
Come healing of the reason
Come healing of the heart

O troubled dust concealing
An undivided love
The heart beneath is teaching
To the broken heart above

Let the heavens falter
Let the earth proclaim
Come healing of the altar
Come healing of the name

O longing of the branches
To lift the little bud
O longing of the arteries
To purify the blood

I know my days are few

Just a lot of things to do
I thought the past would last me
But the darkness got that too

I shoulda seen it coming
It was right behind your eyes
You were young and it was summer
I just had to take a dive
When I knew was easy, the darkness was the price.

I don't smoke no cigarette, I don't drink no alcohol
I ain't had much loving yet
But that's always been your call
Hey I don't miss it baby
I got no taste for anything at all

And I used to love the view

He’s a sportsman and a shepherd
He’s a lazy bastard
Living in a suit

But he does say what I tell him
Even though it isn’t welcome
He just doesn't have the freedom
To refuse

He will speak these words of wisdom
Like a sage, a man of vision
Though he knows he’s really nothing
But the brief elaboration of a tube

Going home
Without my sorrow
Going home
Sometime tomorrow
Going home
To where it’s better
Than before

Going home
Without my burden
Going home
Behind the curtain
Going home
Without the costume
That I wore

He wants to write a love song
An anthem of forgiving
A manual for living with defeat

A cry above the suffering
A sacrifice recovering
But that isn’t what I need him
To complete

I want to make him certain
That he doesn’t have a burden
That he doesn’t need a vision
That he only has permission
To do my instant bidding
Which is to say what I have told him
To repeat

Going home
Without my sorrow

And the men they dance on the polka-dots
And it's partner found, it's partner lost
And it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops
It's closing time
(Closing time)
(Closing time)
(Closing time)

Yeah the women tear their blouses off
And the men they dance on the polka-dots
And it's partner found, it's partner lost
And it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops
It's closing time

Ah we're lonely, we're romantic
And the cider's laced with acid
And the holy spirit's crying, where's the beef?
And the moon is swimming naked
And the summer night is fragrant
With a mighty expectation of relief
So we struggle and we stagger
Down the snakes and up the ladder
To the tower where the blessed hours chime
And I swear it happened just like this
A sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss
The gates of love they budged an inch
I can't say much has happened since
But closing time
(Closing time)
(Closing time)
(Closing time)

I swear it happened just like this
A sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss
The gates of love they budged an inch
I can't say much has happened since
(I can't say much has happened since)
We're closing time
Closing time

I loved you for your beauty
But that doesn't make a fool of me
You were in it for your beauty too
And I loved you for your body
There's a voice that sounds like god to me
Declaring, (declaring) declaring,declaring that your body's really you
And I loved you when our love was blessed
And I love you now there's nothing left
But sorrow and a sense of overtime
And I missed you since the place got wrecked
And I just don't care what happens next
Looks like freedom but it feels like death
It's something in between, I guess
It's closing time
(Closing time)
(Closing time)
(Closing time)

Yeah I missed you since the place got wrecked
By the winds of change and the weeds of sex
Looks like freedom but it feels like death
It's something in between, I guess
It's closing time

Yeah we're drinking and we're dancing
But there's nothing really happening
And the place is dead as heaven on a Saturday night
And my very close companion
Gets me fumbling gets me laughing
She's a hundred but she's wearing
Something tight
And I lift my glass to the awful truth
Which you can't reveal to the ears of youth
Except to say it isn't worth a dime
And the whole damn place goes crazy twice
And it's once for the devil and once for Christ
But the boss don't like these dizzy heights
We're busted in the blinding lights
Of closing time
(Closing time)
(Closing time)
(Closing time)

The whole damn place goes crazy twice
And it's once for the devil and once for Christ
But the boss don't like these dizzy heights
We're busted in the blinding lights
(Busted in the blinding lights)
Busted in the blinding lights
Of closing time
Closing time

Oh the women tear their blouses off
And the men they dance on the polka-dots
It's closing time
And it's partner found, it's partner lost
And it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops
It's closing time
I swear it happened just like this

It's closing time (closing time)

I love you now there's nothing left

Leonard Cohen,"You can dance every dance with the guy
Who gives you the eye, let him hold you tight
You can smile every smile for the man
Who held your hand 'neath the pale moon light
But don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin' save the last dance for me

Oh, I know that the music's fine
Like sparklin' wine, go and have your fun
Laugh and sing, but while we're apart
Don't give your heart to anyone
But don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin' save the last dance for me

Baby, don't you know I love you so
Can't you feel it when we touch?
I will never, never let you go
I love you, oh so much

You can dance, go and carry on
'Till the night is gone
And it's time to go
If he asks if you're all alone
Can he walk you home, you must tell him no
'Cause don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
Save the last dance for me

Oh, I know that the music's fine
Like sparklin' wine, go and have your fun
Laugh and sing, but while we're apart
Don't give your heart to anyone

And don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darling, save the last dance for me

So don't forget who's taking you home
Or in whose arms you're gonna be
So darling, save the last dance for me

Oh baby, won't you save the last dance for me?
Oh baby, won't you promise that you'll save
The last dance for me>
Save the last dance, the very last dance for me",Save the Last Dance for Me
Leonard Cohen,"If it be your will 
That I speak no more 
And my voice be still 
As it was before 
I will speak no more 
I shall abide until 
I am spoken for 
If it be your will 
If it be your will 
That a voice be true 
From this broken hill 
I will sing to you 
From this broken hill 
All your praises they shall ring 
If it be your will 
To let me sing 
From this broken hill 
All your praises they shall ring 
If it be your will 
To let me sing 

If it be your will 
If there is a choice 
Let the rivers fill 
Let the hills rejoice 
Let your mercy spill 
On all these burning hearts in hell 
If it be your will 
To make us well 

And draw us near 
And bind us tight 
All your children here 
In their rags of light 
In our rags of light 
All dressed to kill 
And end this night 
If it be your will 

If it be your will",Show Me the Place [Video] [*]
Leonard Cohen,"I saw some people starving
There was murder, there was rape
Their villages were burning
They were trying to escape
I couldn't meet their glances
I was staring at my shoes
It was acid, it was tragic
It was almost like the blues
It was almost like the blues

I have to die a little
Between each murderous thought
And when I'm finished thinking
I have to die a lot
There's torture and there's killing
And there's all my bad reviews
The war, the children missing
Lord, it's almost like the blues
It's almost like a blues

So I let my heart get frozen
To keep away the rot
My father says I'm chosen
My mother says I'm not
I listened to their story
Of the Gypsies and the Jews
It was good, it wasn't boring
It was almost like the blues
It was almost like the blues

There is no God in Heaven
And there is no Hell below
So says the great professor
Of all there is to know
But I've had the invitation
That a sinner can't refuse
And it's almost like salvation
It's almost like the blues
It's almost like a blues
Almost like a blues",Almost Like the Blues
Leonard Cohen,"I was born in chains but I was taken out of Egypt
I was bound to a burden, but the burden it was raised
Lord I can no longer keep this secret
Blessed is the name, the name be praised

I fled to the edge of a mighty sea of sorrow
Pursued by the riders of a cruel and dark regime
But the waters parted and my soul crossed over
Out of Egypt, out of Pharaoh’s dream

Word of words and the measure of all measures
Blessed is the name, the name be blessed
Written on my heart in burning letters
That’s all I know, I cannot read the rest

I was idled with my soul, when I heard that you could use me
I followed very closely, but my life remained the same
But then you showed me where you had been wounded
In every atom broken is a name

I was alone on the road, your love was so confusing
All my teachers told me I had myself to blame
But in the grip of sensual illusion
The sweet unknowing unifies a name

Word of words, and the measure of all measures
Blessed is the name, the name be blessed
Written on my heart in burning letters
That’s all I know, I cannot read the rest

I've heard the soul unfolds in the chambers of its longing
And the bitter liquor sweetens in the amber cup
But all the ladders of the night have fallen
Only darkness now, to lift the longing up

Word of words and measure of all measures
Blessed is the name, the name be blessed
Written on my heart in burning letters
That’s all I know, I cannot read the rest",Born in Chains
Leonard Cohen,"Did I ever love you
Did I ever need you
Did I ever fight you
Did I ever want to

Did I ever leave you
Was I ever able
Or are we still leaning
Across the old table

Was it ever settled
Was it ever over
And is it still raining
Back in November

The lemon trees blossom
The almond trees whither
Was I ever someone
Who could love you forever

Did I ever love you
Does it really matter
Did I ever fight you
You don’t need to answer

Did I ever leave you
Was I ever able
And are we still leaning
Across the old table",Did I Ever Love You
Leonard Cohen,"Wasn’t hard to love you
Didn’t have to try
Wasn’t hard to love you
Didn’t have to try
Held you for a little while
My Oh My Oh My

Drove you to the station
Never asked you why
Drove you to the station
Never asked you why
Held you for a little while
My Oh My Oh My

All the boys are waving
Trying to catch your eye
All the boys are waving
Trying to catch your eye
Held you for a little while
My Oh My Oh My

Wasn’t hard to love you
Didn’t have to try
Wasn’t hard to love you
Didn’t have to try

Leonard Cohen,"The war was lost
The treaty signed
I was not caught
I crossed the line

I was not caught
Though many tried
I live among you
Well disguised

I had to leave
My life behind
I dug some graves
You’ll never find

The story’s told
With facts and lies
I have a name
But nevermind

Nevermind
Nevermind
The war was lost
The treaty signed

There’s truth that lives
And truth that dies
I don’t know which
So nevermind

Your victory
Was so complete
Some among you
Thought to keep

A record of
Our little lives
The clothes we wore
Our spoons, our knives

The games of luck
Our soldiers played
The stones we cut
The songs we made

Our law of peace
Which understands
A husband leads
A wife commands

And all of this
Expressions of
The sweet indifference
Some call love

The high indifference
Some call fate
But we had names
More intimate

Names so deep and
Names so true
They’re blood to me
They’re dust to you

There is no need
That this survive
There’s truth that lives
And truth that dies

Nevermind
Nevermind
I live the life
I left behind

There’s truth that lives
And truth that dies
I don't know which
So nevermind

I could not kill
The way you kill
I could not hate
I tried I failed

You turned me in
At least you tried
You side with them
Whom you despise

This was your heart
This swarm of flies
This was once your mouth
This bowl of lies

You serve them well
I’m not surprised
You’re of their kin
You’re of their kind

Nevermind
Nevermind
I had to leave my life behind
The story’s told
With facts and lies
You own the world
So nevermind

Nevermind
Nevermind
I live the life
I left behind

I live it full
I live it wide
Through layers of time
You can’t divide

My woman’s here
My children too
Their graves are safe
From ghosts like you

In places deep
With roots entwined
I live the life I left behind

The war was lost
The treaty signed
I was not caught
I crossed the line

I was not caught
Though many tried
I live among you
Well disguised",Nevermind
Leonard Cohen,"You said that you were with me
You said you were my friend
Did you really love the city
Or did you just pretend

You said you loved her secrets
And her freedoms hid away
She was better than America
That’s what I heard you say

You said how could this happen
You said how can this be
The remnant all dishonored
On the bridge of misery

And we who cried for mercy
From the bottom of the pit
Was our prayer so damn unworthy
The Son rejected it?

So gather up the killers
Get everyone in town
Stand me by those pillars
Let me take this temple down

The king so kind and solemn
He wears a bloody crown
So stand me by that column
Let me take this temple down

You said how could this happen
You said how can this be
The chains are gone from heaven
The storms are wild and free

There’s other ways to answer
That certainly is true
Me, I’m blind with death and anger
And that’s no place for you

There’s a woman in the window
There's a bed in Tinsel Town
I’ll write you when it’s over
Let me take this temple down

You said you loved her secrets
Her freedoms hid away
She was better than America
That’s what I heard you say",Samson in New Orleans
