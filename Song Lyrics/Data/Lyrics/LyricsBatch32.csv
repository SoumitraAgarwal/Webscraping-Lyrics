Craig Campbell,"When the rain comes down
Through the hole in the roof
And every nail in the house
Is coming loose

A for sale sign stuck in the yard
The day it sells is gonna break her heart

She knows I’m out there doing the best I can
Trying to keep these wolves away with my bare hands
We work and scrape and fight and pray until it hurts
I lean on her, she leans on me
That’s what we do
When ends don’t meet

When I drag it home
Dead on my feet
If she worries at all
She don’t let on to me

Her simple smile can say so much
Her ten dollar dress looks like a million bucks

She knows I’m out there doing the best I can
Trying to keep these wolves away with my bare hands
We work and scrape and fight and pray until it hurts
I lean on her, she leans on me
That’s what we do
When ends don’t meet

We hold on a little longer
A little tighter, a little stronger
We love a little deeper
And we dance across the kitchen

She knows I’m out there doing the best I can
Trying to keep these wolves away with my bare hands
We work and scrape we fight and pray until it hurts
I lean on her, she leans on me
That’s what we do
Yeah that’s what we do
When ends don’t meet
When ends don’t meet",When Ends Don't Meet
Craig Campbell,"You can come over,
We can sit on my front porch
We can take a walk.
When it gets colder,
We can climb in my truck,
Yeah, we can talk.
Sit up all night if you like,
I just can't let your restless feet
Find my front steps.

It'd be too easy,
To throw open that door
And go where we've gone
Too many times before.
You'd stay just long enough,
To leave me again,
So you can come over,
But you can't come in.

I'd put on that record,
You'd give me that look,
Oh, you know the one.
Girl, I can betcha
By the end of that first verse,
The damage would be done.
One glass of wine always leads to two,
When it comes to me and you.

It'd be too easy,
To throw open that door
And go where we've gone
Too many times before.
You'd stay just long enough,
To leave me again,
So you can come over,
But you can't come in.

And pretend like we're just a couple old friends
Like you don't know how our story ends.
You'd stay just long enough,
To leave me again,
So you can come over,
Until I get over you,
You can't come in.
You can't come in.",You Can Come Over
Craig Campbell,"Tomorrow, you’re gonna pick your clothes
Off of these hardwood floors and walk out the door, yeah
Tomorrow, you’re gonna hate the sun
For rising and breaking up what we got going in 'cause

Tonight, I’m kissing you right
And holding you like this night
Ain’t ever gonna end
Tonight, gonna lose track of time
Tryna keep that moonlight shining bright
Hanging high up in the sky girl
I’m gonna change your tomorrow
Tonight, yeah

Tomorrow, you’re gonna catch yourself
Smiling 'cause you can’t help
Thinking about the night before
Tomorrow, you’re gonna find your way
Right on back to my place
But girl that’s gonna have to wait

Tonight, I’m kissing you right
And holding you like this night
Ain’t ever gonna end
Tonight, gonna lose track of time
Tryin' to keep that moonlight shining bright
Hanging high up in the sky girl
I’m gonna change your tomorrow
Tonight, yeah

We can’t keep the world from turning
Oh but we can slow it down, yeah

Tonight, I’m kissing you right
And holding you like this night
Ain’t ever gonna end
Tonight, gonna lose track of time
Tryna keep that moonlight shining bright
Hanging high up in the sky girl
I’m gonna change your tomorrow,

Craig Campbell,"My grandpa taught me about buck knifes and shot guns
How to cast an old Zebco
And how to work a stick shift
He taught me the bible about all twelve disciples
And he made sure that I know there's life after this
With pearly gates and streets of gold
He said if I just believe that's where I'll go

Lord when I die I wanna live 
On the outskirts of Heaven
Where there's dirt roads for miles
Hay in the fields and fish in the river
Where there's dogwood trees and honey bees 
And blue skies and green grass forever
Lord when I die, I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven

Now it says in the King James in the Almighty's kingdom
He mentions a mansion that he's built just for me
Now I'd gladly trade it for a farm house with acreage
And a back yard that's shaded and a squeaky front porch swing
That's where I wanna hang my wings

When I die I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven
Where there's dirt roads for miles
Hay in the fields and fish in the river
Where there's dogwood trees and honey bees 
And blue skies and green grass forever
So Lord when I die, I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven
Yeah
Yeah, the good Lord knows me 
He knows I need blue skies and green grass forever
Lord when I die I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven
Yeah, when I die I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven",Outskirts of Heaven
Craig Cardiff,"High speed drift on a prairie road
Hot tires sing like a string being bowed
Sudden town rears up then explodes
Fragments resolve into white line code
Whirl on silver wheels 

Black earth energy receptor fields
Undulate under a grey cloud shield
We outrun a river color brick red mud
That cleaves apart hills soil rich as blood 

Highway squeeze in construction steam
Stop caution hard hat yellow insect machines
Silver steel towers stalk rolling land
Toward distant stacks that shout ""Feed on demand"" 

One hundred miles later the sky has changed
Urban anticipation, we get 4 lanes
Red orange furnace sphere notches down
Throws up silhouette skyline in brown 

Sun dogs flare on windshield glass
Sudden swoop skyward iron horse overpass
Pass a man walking like the man in the moon
Walking like his head's full of Irish fiddle tunes 

The skin around every city looks the same
Miles of flat neon spelling well-known names
Used trucks dirty donuts you you're the one
Fat wheeled cars squeal into the sun 

Radio speakers gargle top 40 trash
Muzak soundtrack to slow collapse
Planet engines pulsate in sidereal time
If you listen close you can hear the whine","Luka (Vega, S.)"
Craig Cardiff,"In a borrowed car we sang evaporated.
It's beautiful when you go low and I go high.
Watch you dear, oh we'll beat this.
If I believe enough the Lord will provide.

Lay on hands, hymns and praises.
Sing in tongues, salvation true and right.
Jesus saves if you let him.
Donation plate passed through the aisle.

Revival day was the saddest, 
Passed on by at the sight of skin and bones.
Pushed to the front but the cameras ducked down.
No one wants to watch dying at home.

In a borrowed car we sang evaporated.
It's beautiful when you go low and I go high.
Watch you dear, oh we'll beat this.
If I believe enough the Lord will provide.",Revival Day
Craig Cardiff,"When we meet in heaven will we
Recognize each other in this light?
A million candle winter light?
All the different shapes of all our different loves, 
They're not wrong anymore, 
They never were before.

Dearest blackbird, we're sorry.
How the birds swarmed the bodies 
For all the souls who left early.
Dearest blackbird, we're sorry.",Heaven
Craig Carothers,"Boy, the way Glenn Miller played 
songs that made the hit parade.
Guys like me we had it made.
Those were the days.
Didn't need no welfare state,
ev'rybody pulled his weight,
gee our old LaSalle ran great.
Those were the days.
And you knew who you were then,
girls were girls and men were men.
Mister we could use a man like Herbert Hoover again.
 
People seemed to be content,
fifty dollars paid the rent,
freaks were in a circus tent.
Those were the days.
Take a little Sunday spin,
go to watch the Dodgers win.
Have yourself a dandy day,
that cost you under a fin. 
Hair was short and skirts were long.
Kate Smith really sold a song.
I don't know just what went wrong,
those were the days.",Those Were the Days
Craig Chaquico,"Holding back the years,
Thinking of the fear I've had for so long.
When somebody hears,
Listen to the fear that's gone.
Strangled by the wishes of pater,
Hoping for the arm of mater,
Get to me sooner or later,

Nothing ever could, yeah.
I'll keep holding on,
I'll keep holding on,
I'll keep holding on,
I'll keep holding on.

Chance for me to escape from all I know.
Holding back the tears.
There's nothing here has grown.
I've wasted all my tears,
Wasted all those years.
Nothing had the chance to be good,

Nothing ever could, yeah.
I'll keep holding on,

I'll keep holding on,
I'll keep holding on,
I'll keep holding on
So tight.",Holding Back the Years
Craig David,"Lonely hours, Lonely days, 
Never meant to drive you away from me, 
I shoulda listened to ya lady and what you had to say, if only
I never knew how much you feel for somebody after you've let them go (let them go) 
And you find out that it's too late to let your feelings show (feelings show) 
And even though I've done you so wrong 
Don't you know, like I know, baby

You see you've got the key to my heart, girl 
Unlock me and take all my feelings apart 
Cause when you said you had to leave, had to go away, 
You closed the door on me; you threw away the key

I'm starting over, I'm feeling down, 
Still can't believe that you're not around. 
I shoulda been there for you, baby
But now I'm crying on this melody tonight

I didn't realize that there is no other remedy to end this pain (end this pain) 
But if you come back in my life then maybe I can start to live again (live again) 
And even though you're being so strong 
Don't you know, like I know, baby

You see you've got the key to my heart, key to my heart girl 
Unlock me and take all my feelings apart 
Cause when you said you had to leave, had to go away, 
You closed the door on me; you threw away the key

And everyday and night I'm thinking about you constantly 
Now I know for sure how much you really mean to me, yeah 
Sometimes I get a rush and I see, how we were meant to be, lady

You see you've got the key to my heart, key to my heart girl 
Unlock me and take all my feelings apart 
Cause when you said you had to leave, had to go away, 
You closed the door on me; you threw away the key",Key to My Heart
Craig David,"I'm walking away
From the troubles in my life
I'm walking away
Oh, to find a better day

I'm walking away
From the troubles in my life
I'm walking away
Oh, to find a better day

Sometimes, some people get me wrong
When it's something I've said or done
Sometimes, you feel there is no fun
That's why you turn and run

But now I truly realize
Some people don't want to compromise
Well I saw them with my own eyes
Spreading those lies, yeah

Well I don't want to live a lie
Too many sleepless nights
Not mentioning the fights
I'm sorry to say lady

I'm walking away
From the troubles in my life
I'm walking away
Oh, to find a better day

Well I'm so tired baby
Of things you say
You're driving me away
Whispers in the powder room baby

Don't listen to the games they play
Girl I thought you'd realized
I'm not like them other guys
'Cause I saw them with my own eyes
You should've been more wise babe

Well I don't want to live a lie
Too many sleepless nights
Not mentioning the fights

Craig David,"On my way to see my friends who lived a couple blocks away from me (oh)
As I walked through the subway
It must have been about quarter past three
In front of me, stood a beautiful honey with a beautiful body
She asked me for the time
I said it'd cost her name, a six digit number and a date with me tomorrow at nine

Did she decline? No
Didn't she mind? I don't think so
Was it for real? Damn, sure
What was the deal? A pretty girl aged twenty-four
So was she keen? She couldn't wait
Cinnamon queen? Let me update
What did she say? She said she'd love to rendezvous
She asked me what we were gonna do
Said we'd start with a bottle of moet for two

Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday 
We chilled on Sunday
I met this girl on Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday 
We chilled on Sunday

Nine was the time
'Cause I'll be getting mine and she was looking fine
Smooth talker, she told me
She'd love to unfold me all night long
Ooh, I loved the way she kicked it
From the front to back she flipped it (back she flipped it, ooh the way she kicked)
And I oh, oh, I, yeah
Hope that she'd care
'Cause I'm a man who'll always be there (oh yeah)

I'm not a man to play around, baby (oh yeah)
'Cause a one night stand isn't really fair
From the first impression, girl, hmm you don't seem to be like that
'Cause there's no need to chat for there'll be plenty time for that
From the subway to my home
Endless ringing of my phone
When your feeling all alone
All you gotta do is just call me, call me

Craig David,"One two buckle my shoe
Three four step inside the venue and I 
See in the corner of my eye
This beautiful girl 
That's standing by the bar looking fly
She was like a beauty queen out of a magazine
Looked about 19
Five minutes talking next thing
It's her number being written

[Chorus:]
If you're looking for the man that can
Go check all the girls messing up with your program
With lyrics that make you say damn
The booty man can
Click off, click on www.CD.com
International bomb
The booty man's really got it going on

One two unbuckle my shoe
Kissing and cuddling 
At my crib after the venue and I
Didn't want to take it too fast so I said slow slow
I gotta make some calls so keep it down low
She was like I can't believe you want to talk instead
Of making love to me
Five minutes chillin', next thing it's my name she's calling

[Chorus]

Bomb bomb the booty man, booty man's really got it goin'
On on the booty man, booty man's really got it going

Into the year 2 0 straight from 9 9

One day minding my own business
Girl from the back won't keep her distance
She was all over me
Just won't let it be
So I said to her I got a girl at home
This is so hard for me, but you got to leave me alone
She said she didn't want to listen to me
Knew what exactly she wanted to be
My baby
I must admit that she was getting to me
Waiting for me
Wanting me to hold her oh so tightly

Together, forever, wherever, whatever
She said she couldn't find nobody better
Wasn't gonna give up on me never
She said

Ooh you're looking so fly

You said that you were really feeling Sisqo's song
About the thong th-thong thong thong that I wanna see
And when you talk like that you know you're really tempting me
But I got a girl at home who'll do the same for me

Felt just like an ordinary day
Just around the corner,such a surprise a beautiful angel materialised
Time stood still,face to face
I'm sure we'd meet in another time and place

Our eyes met as you passed me by
Two souls entwined in the blink of an eye
And I had to figure out what I'd be missing
So I turned to you and asked if you wanted to

Sometimes, some people get me wrong
When it's something I've said or done
Sometimes, you feel there is no fun
That's why you turn and run
But now I truly realize
Some people don't want to compromise
Well I saw them with my own eyes
Spreading those lies, yeah

Together for eternity
But now you're gone it's plain to see
I was living just a fantasy
So many things ever I found a love that's true
Finding it hard to push on through
Since I've been away from you

When I first met you waiting
Standing up by the bus stop
I knew you were something special
Weak in my knees
I wanted to drop yeah e yeah
So we checked each other
What we had going on was so hot yeah
I never thought you'd leave me no

Appearing in everything that I do
It was only last feek 
Friday when I saw you out with your girlfriends walking
Round my way (wanted to stop) yeah e yeah
I feel when all's said and done
From this love I've had I've learnt a klot yeah
I never thought you'd leave me no

Craig David,"You know I'm the kind of guy that does a nine to five
Working real hard 'cause that's the way I live my life
Back home just me & you girl all alone
With no one interrupting, switch off the phone
But I could be that other guy
Who comes home late night after night then tells you lies
So why you tripping out on me girl all the time
When everyday it's only you that's on my mind oh

Every time we take one step forward you take two steps back 
Every time it's right you bring left back oh
Girl you really ought to think about it 
'cause there's really no doubt about it
You know I've been there for you & that's the truth 
(x2)

You know you're the kind of girl that doesn't need to front
Keep it real let me know just what you want
Sometimes you just don't know when to stop
You worry so much over nothing
You risk losing what you've got
Now can't you see there's no other girl
I think you're the most beautiful woman in this world yeah
But you say I don't appreciate ya
And I don't know how to treat ya
We don't do the same things we did no more

[Chorus (x2)]

(Remember)
It wasn't that long ago, you told me that you loved me so
Don't forget all the nights we shared
When you told me girl just how much you cared
(Remember)
You think I'm being led astray, but that's the way players play
I'm not that kind of man, why can't you understand 'cause I 
Want you to trust in me, baby girl can't you see
You're only gonna mess things up
You've done enough why can't you stop 'cause
You're gonna lose what's good for you
And that's the last thing you want to do
Won't find another like me oh

Craig David,"On my way from the studio driving on my way home
Happy 'cause I'm gonna see my girl tonight
Something messing with my radio 
Gotta be my cell phone ringing

I picked it up it was my girlfriend
But she wouldn't talk to me no
I heard some bitching in the background saying
That my girl was too good for me yeah
And I was like what? Why you chatting my name (oh)
Say it again, nothing to hide got nothing to gain
People wan front just because of my fame
You better stop! Before I lose control
Had enough of you friends & I'm letting you know
I'm Craig David & I'm running the show
And if you're talking a lot of bull baby you got to go so

Eenie meenie minie mo gonna miss you that I know
Girl it's been wonderful but I gotta let you go
Eenie meenie minie mo getting kinde critical
Don't want to hurt you though but I gotta let you go

So tell me why you want to do me like that
Used to give you things now you're throwing 'em back
Access to the visa, the keys to the flat 
Widescreen tv, dvd's & that
All of a sudden you be trippin' when I answer the phone
Talking all about me in an angry tone
Talking all about how I be doing you wrong
You're crazy, whatever happened to the good girl?
The one that was in to me yeah
I want to tell it to your face girl
That one of us had to leave so

Well I'm just an ordinary guy, dealing with rumours & lies
But your friends keep on filling your head with this nonsense & 
I can't take no more

Craig David she only after that wage payslip
That's why she got you pulling strange faces
Drinking hennessy 'til your brain's wasted
She don't want to be the girl that Craig stays with
She just want to be there while Craig stays rich
She wouldn't be with him if he was paid basic and
She wouldn't be there if he wasn't made famous

She had a gold digger degree she must've studied for that
Wanted me to get her a mansion with a truck in the back
Flood her with ice 'til a nigga like honey relax
Messiah bolical ain't even got no money for that
All of a sudden you be tripping on my cellular phone
Talking about all of the women that be taking me home
Talking about all of the women I supposedly boned
She crazy, you know what it is 
You give them an inch & they be taking the p**s
You fed up of it get rid of the witch, don't be taking her s***t
She wasn't saying this when he was licking her lower lip
Making her throw a fit, put you fingers all over it
Tripping all over you whenever you rock the show
Trying to get money 'cause she know you got the dough
And the next time she trippin' fella you drop the phone
If you're talking a lot of bull baby you got to go",Eenie Meenie

So shut the back door 'cause no one's trupping
Just keep playing that song

Let me see those hands up in the air
All my fellas bouncing in the clus let me hear you say yeah

To raise the roof with your crew (true)
But you can bring it down if you want to

Let me see those hands up in the air
All my ladies shaking what you got 
Let me heat you say yeah 
If you want to jump around
Believe that now's the time to get down
Moving to the crazy sound
If it feels good to you whatcha gonna do?

And she knows it very well,kind that you be calling on cell
Falling underneath her spell, so addictive baby can't you tell
Need a hot boy, top boy looking kinda fly

While the beat moves your body, mind & soul

Ooh yeah, come on

Now baby he keeps on saying that
He tells you you're the only one
But everybody's know he's out there having fun
Behind your back & that's a fact & it ain't right
'cause he's fly guy acting like a gentleman
But back in the day I can still remember when
He'd just turn around, wouldn't look twice at you
And I'm just being straight with you
'cause he takes you for a fool
So you should be on your guard
When he thinks you don't have a clue
And I think if the truth be know
That ypu'll end up all alone when
He gets everything he wants 
So girl open up your eyes & see with me

What you see is what you get
Ain't no hidden agenda
So girlfriend when he's playing around
You'd do well to remember

Now lady when he tells you
That he loves you & won't give you up
Takes your car & it's your money that be filling it up
Look at what he's got, thinks he 's hit the jackpot & and it ain't right
'cause your connections keep him sweet & that's so 
Typical
He's only in it for himself & that's so cynical
He'd be out of sight girl if you lost it all,
So I feel bad inside when he's cruising in your ride
'cause I know baby late at night
There's some other girl by his side
And I want to let let you know that he really ought to go
And you should believe in me
'cause I care baby can't you see with me

Sometimes in life you feel the fight is over (over)
And it seems as though the writing's on the wall (yeah)
Superstar, you finally made it
But once your picture becomes tainted
It's what they call
The rise and fall

I always said that I was gonna make it
Now it's plain for everyone to see
But this game I'm in don't take no prisoners
Just casualties

I know that everything is gonna change
Even the friends I knew before me go
But this dream is the life I've been searching for
Started believing that I was the greatest
My life was never gonna be the same

'Cause with the money, came a different status
That's when things changed
Now I'm too concerned with all the things I own
Blinded by all the pretty girls I see
I'm beginning to lose my integrity

[Chorus]

I never used to be a troublemaker
Now I don't even wanna please the fans
No autographs, no interviews
No pictures, and less demands

Given advices that were clearly wrong
The type that seemed to make me feel so right
But some things you may find, can take over your life
Burnt all my bridges, now I've run out of places

And there's nowhere left for me to turn
Been caught in compromising situations
I should have learned
From all those times I didn't walk away

When I knew that it was best to go
Is it too late to show you the shape of my heart

[Chorus]

Now I know (now I know)
I made mistakes (made mistakes)
Think I don't care
But you don't realize what this means to me
So let me have just one more chance
I'm not the man I used to be
Used to be

Now gold diggers go bananas
The same ones that didn't show me no love
When I was cashless
In the day when it really mattered
When I was penning competition
No publishing hits for damage
Now to go gold to me's a minimal
I'm involved in them platinum plaques
And records sold
Heaven knows that I've battled 
Producers with egos
And there were those who were told
Exactly where to go
Somebody please stop these little kids
That want to pull bumpers off my 206
Shoutin' outside of
The block I used to live
They don't like my records

I'm talking maybe meet a honey, take her home tonight
So, shades on, top's off the whip
Taking in the sight as I cruise the strip
As I pull up to a red light
I see the pretty little shorty in my headlights

This girl looked half black, yet half oriental
Man, this chick's got class and style
I'd like to ask her for her credentials
Name, address, numbers to dial
She plays tough when deep down she's gentle
Ain't that hard to read the signs
This girl bangs like Dre instrumentals
Well, here's an acappella of mine

[Chorus]
Two all up in the club
Got my game tight, about to tear it up 
Could be a night that I won't forget
Boy, I'm looking for a honey, and I'm confident
I was dancing, but I had to stop
When I clocked this fly girl wearing a halter top
She had her hair done, nails right
This señorita had a booty that was so tight

She was a hot girl who looked continental
Damn, her body looked so fine
The way she spoke I saw her potential
If looks could kill, then she'd do time
I don't claim to speak perfect Spanish
But I know a few lines 
This female's slicker than your average
And I gotta make her mine 

So, quieres beber conmigo?
(If you don't mind, can I talk to you if it's alright?)
Quiero sentir tu cuerpo
(All night, while we're dancing in the moonlight)
Haz el amor conmigo
(Kissing, touching, caressing)
Ya no me dejes solo
Saying, why didn't I go home with you?

Tonight, I'm from a distance admiring
Girl, you're looking so vibrant
And I dig the way you move your body
Let's get out of this party
Maybe we can get naughty
Say bye, bye, girlfriends
'Cause just in a minute we're gone if we're in sync
(Can we dance?)

Would you like a drink and some loving?
But leave your husband at home
Unless he wants a bump on the dome
Come along, rub alongside me
Put your phone on silence, just breathe
What you're doing is right, what I'm doing is wrong
Only time I do right is when I'm doing a song
So, expect your ex to exit the area
Exterior vex, perplex by the sex
What you drinking?
Drink's on me, find me on drink and drink on me
You can ride next to me, girl; it's ecstasy
Here's something for your ex to see
It's messed up how I slide up your thigh with my right hand
You want to ride all night then I can 
Don't be shy of just one, one-night stand; now, let's go!

[Chorus]",Spanish
Craig David,"Hey baby, oh tell me Craig
Why d'you want to play these games with me?
Thought you always wanted to be with me

Well at first girl I wanted to
But things have changed between me & you
That's why I don't know what I'm gonna do

Lately, you say I've been acting kind of strangely ?
Like I don't love you no more
You say call me, but I just can't explain it's all so crazy
Between me & you baby oh

And even though at first you meant the world to me
The time has come to spread my wings & be set free
So I can figure out the place where I belong
To find my way home now love has gone
Oh my pager saying...

Why don't call me no more ?
It was every night you were calling me before
Given half a chance you'd be knocking at my door 
So tell me what's changed, why don't you give me some time?
Tell me 'cause I can't get you out of my mind
Right up until now we've been doing just fine
So tell me what's changed

Baby since we met I've treated you like a lady
But now I don't know what to do
I think maybe, it's just that my well for you's run empty
What'm gonna do baby oh

And even though at first you made me so happy
My love for you has changed so put the blame on me
Under pressure it's too hard for me to stay
And I feel so guilty when you page me everyday with oh ...

Why won't you answer my page ?
It was you who said thing were never gonna change
And it seems like lately you're acting kinda strange
So tell me what's changed, why can't you even pass by?
Spare some time even just to say hi 
You're not the type of guy who would make a girl cry
So tell me what's changed

Girl I know it seems like I don't care
After all the things we used to share
Now I know it feels like I've done you wrong
But the pain will heal the sooner that I'm gone
Still on my pager saying...

Why don't call me no more ?
It was every night you were calling me before
Given half a chance you'd be knocking at my door 
So tell me what's changed, why don't you give me some time?
Tell me 'cause I can't get you out of my mind

And it seems like lately you're acting kinda strange
So tell me what's changed, why can't you even pass by?
Spare some time even just to say hi 
You're not the type of guy who would make a girl cry
So tell me what's changed

Girl I never meant to make you cry
But it's so hard to fine the words to say
Though I never wanted girl to hurt you

I met this fly girl in a club
Went by the name of pecan deluxe
This ice cream was high maintenance
When I took her out
Nearly cost me twenty bucks
Met this chick named walnut whip
Nearly made me sick
To the point of throwin' up
So I called chocolate chip
With the sweet toffee crisp

Craig David,"Saw some pictures in the paper
Of a girl I'd met the day before
I couldn't believe that hours later
I had reporters knocking at my door
But I used to dream about the
Life I'm living now and
I didn't think I'd miss those things from the past
And I'm not afraid of leaving or letting go of what I had 'cause
I realize that now there's no turning back

'cause I'm a young heart living in a world filled with love
So when teardrops fall from me like rain from above 
I can brush my troubles away 
know that deep down inside
I've got sunshine in my life

I used to think i could do better
My girlfriends always used to get me wrong
Sent distant messages, love letters
But those kind of feelings never lasted long
'cause now the only love I find's whithin a castle made of sand
And when the tide goes out it's swept away
Though I've got my peace of mind & time is firmly on my side
So through the bad times I can safely say..

Ah... now that love's here to stay
I've found a better day to brush my troubles away

On our way to find the key to our emotions
Together we will move the clouds to brighter days

But I know this love between us is growing stronger
You can call me whenever from wherever just remember that
I'll be there through all the stormy weather
Us break up never, no, we'll be together forever

You don't miss your water 'til the well runs dry
But I believe so strongly in you & I
Can't somebody answer me the question why
You don't miss your water 'til the well runs dry

As I close my eyes sit back while reminiscing
Of when we used to fuss & fight but end up kissing
There may be sad & painful times along the way
But in my heart you'll always be, everything and more to me

For I know this love between us is growing stronger
You can call me whenever from wherever just remember that
I'll be there through all the stormy weather
Us break up never, no, we'll be together forever

You are always on my mind you're always on my mind

Craig David,"All right
Come on
Can you fill me in (Let's talk about it)

I was checking this girl next door
When her parents went out
She phoned said, ""hey boy, come on right around""
So I knock at the door
You was standin' with a bottle of red wine, ready to pour
Dressed in long black satin and lace to the floor
So I went in, then we sat down start kissing, caressing
Told me about jacuzzi, sounded interesting
So we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answer phone
Please leave a message after the tone
I mean me and her parents were kind of cool
But they ran a fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to

Saying why were you creeping around late last night
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light
Now you're dressed in black
When I left you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in
Calls diverted to answer phone
Red wine bottle, half the contents gone
When I returned, Jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in

Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say, ""hey girl, come on right around""
So she knocked at the door
I was standing with the keys in my hand to the 4x4
Jumped in my ride, checkin' that nobody saw
The club we went in
We got down bounced bounced to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning
Thought we'd better be leavin'
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it 'cause you felt cold
I mean me and her didn't mean to break the rules
I weren't trying to play your mum and dad for fools
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to

Saying why can't you keep your promises no more
Say you'll be home by 12, come strolling in at 4
Out went the girls but leaving with the boy next door
Can you fill me in
Wearing a jacket, who's property
Said you'd been queuing for a taxi
But you left all your money on the TV
Can you fill me in

All they seem to do is be checking up on you baby
Watchin' our every move, think some day they might approve baby

Why were you creeping around late last night
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light
Now you're dressed in black
When I left you were dressed in white

Told me that would be just fine

Couldn't believe I had her by my side

And I wish she could be mine, but every time I saw her
She'd always pass me by, never could catch her eye

Holding back it nearly drove me crazy that's when I slid up and said girl excuse 
Me 

Mm you're looking so damn fly tonight 
Your body gives me butterflies inside 
I'd really like to talk to you 
So keep doin' what you're doing 
Oh baby 

She's so hypnotic, the way she moves on the floor she's got it 
The way she making me feel I shouldn't want it but his girl she's so sexy 
So hypnotic got every girl up in this club trying to top it
But that don't mean that this girl is gon stop it 
Oh no she's so sexy 

Thought I'd seen everything in the world 
But that all changed for me tonight 
From the moment I looked in your eyes girl (ooh you blew my mind) 
I know it's crazy but don't get me wrong 
I just gotta have you in my life girl 
Your vibe's just so hypnotic? 

Oh baby woo woo woo woo oh yeah 
So hypnotic, the way she moves on the floor she's got it 
The way she making me feel I shouldn't want it but his girl she's so sexy

Craig David,"It's another day at school and he's just walking out the door 
Got his nap sack on his back and his feet dragging on the floor 
Always late, but when he's questioned he can't think of what to say 
How's the bruises from the teacher he's hoping that they go away 
Even though his mom and dad they both got problems of their own 
Called a ? 22 but he'd still rather be at home 
Cries himself to sleep and prays when he wakes up things might have changed 
But everything's still the same 

(But didn't you say) You always said that I should speak up, mm
But it seems like all the things you said to me before mean nothing at all 
Because

I keep telling you that Johnny's hitting me 
That's why I'm late for school (but you never listen) 
Instead you always seen to end up blaming me for things I didn't do (For what it's worth) 
I didn't even want to tell you anything encase it made things worse (Just so you know) 
Every time I say that Johnny's hitting me 
Hey Mom and Dad it hurts 

Everyday keeps on repeating like the record on replay 
Slowly getting off the bus with Johnny waiting at the gates 
Like a friend smiling and waiving and called him out his name 
Put his arm around his neck what's up now gimme all your change 
Too afraid to make a scene or plead with him to let him go 
He just takes whatevers coming, feels the pain with every blow 
Tries in vain to make himself ? as soon as he gets home 
But everything's still the same

Craig David,"You were her only girl 
The most precious thing in her world 
And I know it makes you cry 
That you never got to say goodbye 

You were just running out of time 
To say what was on your mind

But why don't you celebrate the moments that you shared yeah 
'cause now she's watching over you 
It's true 
And you know it too

If you can't take the pain 
Of a broken heart 
Just let her go

I know it feels as though hope is gone 
And it hurts to think of moving on 
But she'd never want to see you sad 
Even though I know this hurts so bad 

Devoted a life to you 
And helped raise the grandson too 
And now I hope you realize 
That I'll always be there by your side 

But why don't we celebrate the moments that we shared yeah 
'cause now she's watching over you 
It's true 
And you know it too

Mm not coming home till the early morn' what am I supposed to say 
Relationships are based on trust so with us it?s obvious 

Why don't we go our separate ways 
Just realize we've nothing left to say 
Neither of us wants to compromise 
Too many secrets, jealousy and lies. 

It seems that we been messing 'round ain't being straight 
You say that we should work it out but it's far too late 
Being honest girl when all said and done got some things to face 
There's nothing left to lose but so much time to waste yeah 
What's the point in playing playing games with me 
We ain't gotta lie 
You might as well just pack our bags and just say goodbye 
Only human girl we both made mistakes but it ain't no use 
I think we should call it quits 'cause we can't go on like this.

Craig David,"[Chorus: x 2]
Sometimes in life you feel the fight is over (over)
And it seems as though the writing's on the wall (yeah)
Superstar, you finally made it
But once your picture becomes tainted
It's what they call
The rise and fall

I always said that I was gonna make it
Now it's plain for everyone to see
But this game I'm in don't take no prisoners
Just casualties

I know that everything is gonna change
Even the friends I knew before me go
But this dream is the life I've been searching for
Started believing that I was the greatest
My life was never gonna be the same

'Cause with the money, came a different status
That's when things changed
Now I'm too concerned with all the things I own
Blinded by all the pretty girls I see
I'm beginning to lose my integrity

[Chorus]

I never used to be a troublemaker
Now I don't even wanna please the fans
No autographs, no interviews
No pictures, and less demands

Given advices that were clearly wrong
The type that seemed to make me feel so right
But some things you may find, can take over your life
Burnt all my bridges, now I've run out of places

And there's nowhere left for me to turn
Been caught in compromising situations
I should have learned
From all those times I didn't walk away

When I knew that it was best to go
Is it too late to show you the shape of my heart

[Chorus]

Now I know (now I know)
I made mistakes (made mistakes)
Think I don't care
But you don't realize what this means to me
So let me have just one more chance
I'm not the man I used to be
Used to be

Craig David,"I can sit and try to figure out the reasons why
You were always going out alone
I thought that you were meeting with some other guy
All those times you weren't at home

I was wrong but then I didn't understand
What you were trying to say to me
I thought that you were busy making other plans
None of those including me

But then I always had
Too many insecurities
Why didn't I
Just decide to let it be?

I never should have walked away
I should've been there for you babe
I know I handled this all wrong
I swear, I didn't know

Things are never gonna be the same
And I don't want no one to blame
I've gone and left you torn, baby
Well, I didn't know

I remember it so clear when I got the call
It was the hospital on the phone
They told me how you slipped and had a nasty fall
And would I come and take you home

Now that was bad enough but they had more to say
Felt like the words came out so slow
""I'm afraid she lost the baby but she'll be okay""
And I didn't even know

But now I see
I should've been there
From the start
Instead of letting it all fall apart

I never should have walked away
I should've been there for you babe
I know I handled this all wrong
I swear, I didn't know

Things are never gonna be the same
And I don't want no one to blame
I've gone and left you torn, baby
Well, I didn't know

I didn't know
What was wrong.
Girl, I didn't know

I hope you know I never meant to hurt you, girl
But I was way too blind to see
That you were only trying to protect me, girl
I wish you'd had more faith in me

Now I realize that I've let you down
And you have reasons to act that way
I thought that you were cheating when you weren't around
That's why I had to walk away

But girl looking back
In spite of all that we've been through
I'm asking is there still a chance
For me and you?

I never should have walked away
I should've been there for you babe
I know I handled this all wrong
I swear, I didn't know

Things are never gonna be the same
And I don't want no one to blame
I've gone and left you torn, baby
Well, I didn't know

I never should have walked away
I should've been there for you babe
I know I handled this all wrong
I swear, I didn't know

Things are never gonna be the same
And I don't want no one to blame
I've gone and left you torn, baby
Well, I didn't know

But you're one in a million, just came off the rails though
Flipped off the track, tryin' to put you back on though

Oh and I'm just about to lose my mind.
Honey, honey yeah.

I know that a man ain't supposed to cry,
But these tears I can't hold inside.
Losin' you would end my life you see,
Cause you mean that much to me.
You could have told me yourself
That you love someone else.

You put your hand on my hand

My heart was locked but nothing stopped you breaking in

That day I'll always remember, yes I will.
Cause that was the day that my daddy died.
I never got a chance to see him.
Never heard nothing but bad things about him.
Mama, I'm depending on you, tell me the truth.

And Mama just hung her head and said,
""Papa was a rolling stone.
Wherever he laid his hat was his home.
(And when he died) All he left us was alone.""
""Papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home.
(And when he died) All he left us was alone.""

Well, well.

Hey Mama, is it true what they say,
That Papa never worked a day in his life?
And Mama, bad talk going around town
Saying that Papa had three outside children and another wife.
And that ain't right.
Heard talk about Papa doing some store front preaching.
Talkin' about saving souls and all the time leeching.
Dealing in debt and stealing in the name of the Lord.

Mama just hung her head and said,
""Papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home.
(And when he died) All he left us was alone.""
Come on come on come on yeah
""Hey, Papa was a rolling stone.
Wherever he laid his hat was his home.
(And when he died) All he left us was alone.""

Uh!

Hey Mama, I heard Papa call himself a jack of all trade.
Tell me is that what sent Papa to an early grave?
Folk say Papa would beg, borrow, steal to pay his bill.
Hey Mama, folk say that Papa was never much on thinking.
Spent most of his time chasing women and drinking.
Mama, I'm depending on you to tell me the truth.

When her parents went out
She phoned said, ""hey boy, come on right around""

Dressed in long black satin and lace to the floor
So I went in, then we sat down start kissing, caressing
Told me about jacuzzi, sounded interesting
So we jumped right in

Please leave a message after the tone

Nineteen ninety nine when I first came on the scene
Skinny young breh from out Southampton
With a bunch of melodies for days, know what I mean
Lean and mean, embodied the whole scene
Packin' on muscle like bars of protein
Crushin' every microphone that I be holding
'Cause you know I be training dirty but sometime keeping it clean

Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say, ""hey girl, come on right around""
So she knocked at the door
I was standing with the keys in my hand to the 4x4
Jumped in my ride, checkin' that nobody saw
The club we went in
We got down bounced bounced to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning
Thought we'd better be leavin'
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it 'cause you felt cold
I mean me and her didn't mean to break the rules

Craig Finn,"A man darkened our doorway
He said he's here to share the good news
He had a smile straight from the movies
But when I looked down at his shoes
There were holes and they showed his toes
The right was left. The black was brown
And later on in the garage I couldn't find my chainsaw
In the distance I heard trees just falling down

I was underneath the city I was riding around on trains
Fell asleep before Nassau Ave.
And I ended up in Maine
There were big tall trees and rocky coastline
And the waves came in so wild
But for all the natural beauty there were still so many kids that were asking me for something that could help them to get high

We're all good. We're all bad
We're euphoric and we're sad
We roll the rock away and check the tomb
We're awake and we're aware that we're confused and cold and scared

Joan Didion and Graham Greene
Said roughly the same thing
You bring your Jesus to the jungle
Try to teach people to sing
All the hymns that you love because you learned them as a kid  and they make perfect sense to you
There's  a point in time when thousands die
And you've got to maybe think that maybe Jesus isn't getting through

We're freezing in the forest
There's no wood to heat the house
We took axes ti the furniture
We pulled the floorboards out
There's animals scratching at the door
And they know we're gonna die
There were big tall trees and rocky coastline
And the waves came in so wild

We're all wild.  We're all free
We're all back from Tennessee
With the souvenirs to prove that we were there
We're flying round in planes
We're riding around in trains
Searching out those panoramic views
Woke up in the ocean with the Honolulu Blues

We're all good. We're all bad
We're euphoric and we're sad

Craig Finn,"There was a party at that high-rise up on Harmon
It was dead except a couple people dancing
While our eyes were still adjusting to the dark her appetite was expanding
The dude with the long fingernails I don't think that I trust him all that much
It cost ten dollars just to get inside the building
It costs more to get in touch

I went to the SA to get some cigs
I asked the doorman to remember me
I looked up to see the moon and I saw you and him out on the balcony
It was the same thing that you did to me

Don't want to be your old man
I want to be your new man another time all over
I miss the way your eyes they used to spark when you'd look over your shoulder
The dude with the long fingernails I think he's gonna take such good care of you
I've seen him shave up at the library
I've seen him sleep behind the Caribou

I took the bus back uptown because I knew that it was over
I didn't need to know the rest of it
I know the look. I know the lines
I know the laugh from back when we first started it
Such a drunk romantic genesis
Now we've really made a mess of this

I'll put your stuff out on the driveway
You can get it when you walk back through the white light
I'll leave a sandwich in your suitcase in case you're hungry when you come back from the high-rise
I hope your dude don't break his nails when he tries to help you carry all your stuff

Craig Finn,"Jackson was an actor 
At least he was when he was well
Stephanie was good to me but not so much to herself
We were holed up in a hotel room from August to November
It was Jackson, me, and Stephanie
The rest I don't remember

Stephanie appeared to me in the back half of the theater
We met up with Jackson on the strand a few days later
We pooled our funds and made a run
We were foolproof when it counted
It was Jackson, me, and Stephanie
And it didn't seem all that crowded

Now why you asking about Jackson?
It was a long time ago and nothing really happened
Why you asking about Jackson?

Jackson just got restless
Couldn't take the lack of action
He was sort of like a shark
He just had to keep on swimming
And the sailors kept on coming off the boats down at the harbor
It was difficult to stop
It was easy to get started

Stephanie came on strong but suddenly went weak
She seemed a little speedy and her tongue worked at her teeth
The sirens came behind us

It was a bit be fore we heard it
It was Jackson, me and Stephanie
And for a while it felt just perfect

Now why you asking about Jackson?
It was a long time ago and nothing really happened
Someone said he ended up in Denver
Someone said he went to Kansas City
Someone said he went off the deep end
Some said he was living there already
One day Jackson just didn't show up to the party
One day Jackson just didn't show up to the party

Stephanie was long on looks and short on mental health
She said depression is an ocean and it's prone to tides and swells

We rode around all afternoon
He sold me his guitar
I've got a new friend and my new friend's name is Jesus

I wish I was with Jesus when I met you

Craig Finn,"By the way that you picked up the phone
I could tell that you weren't gonna die
February is about as long as it is wide

I guess I've been pretty good with it
Trying hard not to get too obsessed with it
I guess I shouldn't have been surprised

I guess I was pretty much prepared for it
I was just stuck in my own sense of time
Rigid and depressed, needy, halfway pissed and resigned

The parking lots and the office talk
They punch my card at the coffee shop
I'm pretty sure we're all gonna die
I'm pretty sure we're all gonna die

I suppose you thought that I'd be shaken up
I suppose you thought I'd be gushing blood
Not true
I only died on the inside

I suppose you thought that I'd be taken out
Back behind one of those bars downtown
Not true
I'm still alive on the outside

Good old Freddie Mercury is the only guy that advises me
This time, he said if you can't beat them join them

I've been reading about Calvary
The crucifixion still gets to me
I guess Golgotha means the mount of execution

The best advice that I've gotten was from good old Johnny Rotten
He said God Save The Queen
He said no future for you
No future for me

I suppose you thought that I'd be eaten up
By the bars or the pigs or the sheep or the studs
I'm alive
Except for the inside

I suppose you thought that I'd be the first one to go
By the bars or the pigs or the sheep or the shows
I'm alive

But we can't go back
Man, I'd take off tomorrow if I had any cash
The cigarettes got the best of us
There's not much left of us

And there's still a little bit
And we can split it up
I can walk by the park and see if anything is up
Sometimes lonely is easy. Sometimes together is too tough
There's not much left of us

The part that remains is rotten and bruised
The soft spot on a piece of fruit
We can cut off the black and eat at the rest
And that's probably what we're gonna do

And from what I understand
He's just some boy with a band
But when I walked by the park you were holding his hand
You dropped it like it was hot to the touch
There's not much left of us

And so you went with him. Down to Birmingham
Stayed in some fancy hotel on a credit card scam
Left in a limo. Came back on the bus
With not much left of us

The part that remains is rotten and bruised
The soft spot on the passion fruit 
We can cut off the black and feast on the rest

I've been trying to stop obsessing you
There really isn't all that much to do
When you're living in a rented room

Playing records in a rented room
Hotter than Hell into Bark at the Moon
Certain things they get really hard to do
When you're living in a rented room

I've been thinking about the things we did
The things that we talked about and the lives that we lived
When things got bad we would just drink and sit
When things were still good we would dance

Started coming here two years ago
They play the right kind of rock and roll
The drinks are cheap and they leave you alone
I go downstairs and have a drink or two

She used to take off her tights
Turn out the lights
Get into bed
She fit me just right
My pillow still tastes like her perfume
She used to wake up at dawn
Put on her robe
Walk out on our lawn all sleepy and slow
Now I live above a saloon

I bathe in the dark
It feels like the womb
I know I should be getting over you
Certain things are really hard to do

I bathe in the dark

Craig Finn,"Sean says he can't sit here and tell her that it's really that simple
Because it's not that simple, it's exhausting and confusing and it's scary and complex
He hates how Shannon talks about herself like she's a whole separate person
And he's still pissed at her doctors but he's mostly just sick of not connecting

What the hell are we going to do when they finally let you come home from the hospital?
Sit around the house and make fake plans and then walk down to the Wagon Wheel?
The bills are gonna come and we'll just shrug our shoulders at the notion
The numbers so far into the beyond they look a little bit surreal

Satisfaction is a funny thing
Funny enough that when she brings it up he laughs a little bit
Before he breaks down.
It was obvious to anyone
The way she took her medication at the bar
The way she crossed herself
When it's the bartender's round

He's not gonna tell her its a matter of just kind of trying harder
He's not going to tell her if you love someone then you should set them free
He wishes that she wasn't always saying that she's sorry and looking up with terrified eyes
He said I wish that you could try to love yourself the same way that you love me

Frustration is a funny friend
Funny enough that he keeps coming up
And making me do things that I don't like
When you come home from the hospital

I came up the Western pier
There's one thing you should know about
Christ is watching me right now

Someone saw something and they shot it down
I spent seven months in another town
At night I'd walk down on the beach
One night I saw them watching me

They rolled up. They put the cuffs on
Then they drove me deep into the valley

You don't have to keep running
But you best be leaving

You can't take away all the parts of you
that make you do the things you do

Keep coming up the boulevard

I got stuck in a snowbank
I was too drunk to drive to Edina
Right there is proof of my faith that God watches us
And the North Stars went south
And my friends all went out to Seattle
I stuck around town

And the guys at Northeast ride bicycles up to the market

And the writing on walls in the stalls in the bathroom says ""Cindy's so easy""

Decided to do what he said
He went through my jacket and found all my packets and matches
He lit up a cig and put the Kryptonite over my head

I was knocked out down in the mud too heavy to float off to Memphis

Made coffee over a campfire

A cage or the heaviest cross ever made
A gauge of the deadliest trap ever laid

For showing me home
For singing these tears
Finally I've found that I belong here

That cling to the backs of my knees and my feet
Well I'm drowning in time to a desperate beat

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Aww shit, here come the man again
You know if you can't with the style that's goin on right now
then you need to be sittin down

If MC's can't get with the style that's goin on
then you need to sit down

Do your thing Mack, do it to 'em nigga!  Ahh whassup?
What you don't know, what you don't know, kick 'em in the grill

""But anyway, I'd like to take this.. anyway, I'd
 Anyway, I'd like to this time out to bother you""

Oh no no no no
No I don't think you can get liver than me G
So sit back, relax, Mack's about to attack
And turn your flav into Similac cause it's like that
I kick funk out the frame, make it insane
With all local stops set to crumble like a (?) train
My thickest format, my format's thicker all that
No comp for combat with bwoy like Supercat
Show you where my head's at I crack you with a bat
Where the funk?  Hear the trunk a bit and fat knit(?)
Rearrange the skit make it fit so you can't sit
Now ain't that some shh.. I rip it
I snap a jaw, I stabba jab a dinosaur
Live from Creedmore under the floor
It's like the roughest of ruffnecks, wicked and (?)
Check the (?) MC and his project
All you brothers need to know doe
There's no more best MC cause that is now me
See, G, I am king MC
Once said from me can't another brother disagree
Got the funk bleedin all out your trunk
And there's all there is to it (that's all there is)

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
If you can't funk with the style that's goin on
then you need to be sittin down

You must got no brains in ya head
I kill ya dead on the spot with the hits I got
Trust my flavor G, I make ya want to pee-pee
I got what you can't see, somethin like a leprosy
I slow it dowwwwn, somethin like.. this
When it's time for me to stun 'em
MC's I warned them..
I'll put 'em on the moon without funk to listen to
Then again, my vibration
may give the sensation they're on vacation
y'all brothers need a (?)
Real rugged alligator MC hater from the fader
You little tic-tac, tryin to act like a lumberjack
Sit back and watch how the earth crack
You funk around, you lay around, that's how it goes
And I suppose MC's still want to try me
King of the mountain is a hard rock
Do you understand, smile and I'll take you out like the mob
Check it black, after the Mack there's no recoup
Not even soup, get out shake the hula hoop
Comin out the ground..
Gettin down..

Sometimes alone I be writin
Must be frightenin, to hear I'm on the air
but I don't care, (?) 'til I'll see you sick(?)
Son, grandson, no tellin when I'm done (no tellin baby)
I'm about do you and you on some new
Who has a date and thank you for waitin
There my bad, I thought you took a beatin in the brain
then you learned from rap that rap's a mistake
You won't get a break
Big as a cake for me to make, and you bake
So, banzaii, here comes the flyest guy
that you ever heard in your lifetime (yup yup yup)
I do a behind..
and rewind, I want to kick some more shit
Down your faucet, I pours it
Mighta lost it, but then I retrieve it
Believe it, I got this fat okey-dokey style for a while
Peace from the king
Peace from the king G, here it go

Rain like bad weather, 
Rain like whoever never.

Shake your ass 'til it stank cause I dominate.
See I ain't scared of you mutherfuckers.
To me ya all sucker,
Cause I make the ruckus,
Don't try to buck us,
We roll bullet proof with no cuff,
On the roof bittin like a saber tooth.

The mics now in the right hands cause the Macks on the
earth, just to spoil your plans,
More pep then the peppershaker, rough earthquaker
Couldn't take me if ya mamma make ya.
I back up the funk that I bring,
With unknown to man slang
With bigger bite than the devil's fang
I ain't met who could hand.
If ya testing in ya lesson
Got me dressing for your funeral session.
Man, it won't even matter no more,
Graig in 94, has just won the war.
My style will definately take ya over
Have ya sitting looking older than a 4 door Chevy Nova
Why I oughta (smack emdown, Mack) I figure its a slaughter
In the world of dollars ya shit ain't nothing but a quarter.

Fortified on my bad side, an MC on a high
Now we about to set this off
Bass and funk rattlin (one two) send MC's up North
I never had to fight with the mic
I make the funk so dynamite
so parasite MC's might want to bite
Welcome to 1994 (welcome) beats that thump
Rhymes that's bumpin now at your backdoor
Never figured Mack got funk for days (what)
When ""Project: Funk Da World"" brought the brand new craze
(wake it up)
And MC's can't get one line
when the genuine take out deep max on your mind
I'ma hit you with the boom pow
Bolder than Moscow, MC's your judgment's now
Here it comes

MC's.. your judgment is.. now (now MC's)
MC's your judgment day is now (it's time, here it comes)
MC's.. your judgment is.. (hahhh) now
As we get down - MC's your judgment day is now
Here it comes, boyeee

Here comes the one they call King MC
If you're tired of those phony fake rhymes that be (fake)
I'm back with this deeper than Minds of Minolta
Preachin better than preacher up on an altar

I feel that I have pardoned, pardoned
No need for bad grammar startin in my MC garden

And I'ma kinda hungry tonight
So I pulls out the ground a fat rhyme to recite
I don't means to boast but the most is me your host
On post, kickin flav til they ghost (ghost)

Rugged as a mountain bike on MC judgment day

From now until the Earth's gone
In the chess game of rap, MC's ain't nothin but a pawn
(your move)
As the rap romps through your town (through your town)
And MC's around, time to put your panties down (put it down)

MC's.. your judgment is.. now (it's time)
MC's your judgement is now (MC's, check your clock, it's on)
MC's (MC's) your judgment is.. (hahhh) now (Mack the dope)
MC's your judgment day is now (with the flav, gettin down)

It was a rumble tumble, I put the bee inside the bumble
Kickin wicked type of hyper, won't never fumble (ahh)
I float like a tugboat do
Watch the virus, Mack the dope, start affectin you
Is rap real?  You can't deal, what's the matter?
The badder the Don Dadda is still gettin fatter
You be lovin how it sound and shit
And have you dance when I battle for the sponsorin
And you can thank Bad Boy for that
A technique for layin MC's on the mat
Scat, scoot, pussy couldn't make a louder hoop
when I pollute, the world with funk to the roof
Mad rhymes we bust, in God we trust
And MC's don't discuss when ya turn back to dust
(Ashes to ashes)
Mark the year, 1994.. when MC's hit the floor

MC's.. your judgment is.. (hahhh) now
MC's your judgment is now (Final Call, MC's, we get down)

More danger for metropolis we're droppin this
Funk weight that's greater than George Poppadopalous

Rap's new trendsetter, at makin MC's wetter
So plug in the mainline 'til ninety-nine
For funk the genuine now vote for mine (vote for Mack)

I'm strong (like who Craig?) Kong!
I'm flexin, what's next in, my funk track erection
My licks get the kicks like the Chinese connection
Like Damien, the Omen son, I won't run
I never ran, fryin MC's like the Sudan

Mothers get welfare, fathers won't survive
Yo who can get fierce as fierce can get, get set
I'm ready, to eat MC's like spaghetti

Hey, hush it down, quiet, I'm speakin
Unique technique and style that I am freakin
Peakin, speakin like a deacon or a pastor
The master, baby, death, okay G?
Let's get back to the issue with judicial
Weepin willow grab a pillow 'fore I have to diss you

I belong in a hospital insane
Life fast lane on the brain like Bruce Wayne

Manson's my grandson, not so handsome
I'm grotesque -- FUCK IT -- girls still rub my chest
I'm G with James Brown, ""Give it Up or Turn Me Loose""
I'm terror on the red lines, prank phonin Zeus
Craig Mack's the brother that attacks at random
MC's I slammed em, cause I'm fat as Ralph Cramdem
Ras, bumba claat, boy I kill ya
MC's I'm a thriller, from here to Manilla
Lay down, nothin but facts, jacks
The blackjack ace to the beatdown max
Relax, this is just wax on my single
More chips on my shoulder than the chips made by Pringle
So how do you figure?  I'm stronger than your liquor
Wild Irish Rose, huh, strike a pose
I'm death to an MC, below like Jack Dempsey
A shark feedin frenzy, on those that tempt me

Craig Mack,"What da fuck's going on inside the biz
Shit ain't raw no more
Fake is how it is
I hear brothers talking 'bout shooting and killing
Then going home and chilling
Frontin' like a villain
Let me tell you something real
Is how the Mack feel,
I ain't no criminal and represent no steel
I tell you one thing though
MC's better walk slow the Mack's on the earth
to let you know
I'm on a mission from the kingdom of God
To do away with MC's dat represent nimrod
You MC's have been too bad,
So where you go now ice ya gonna wish you had
When MC's disappear it's my fault,
It's time to put all the madness to a flying halt
And radio ya need to be ashamed,
For pumping murder, murder, murder all up in 
our brain
I'll tell ya now Big Poppa don't like it,
Representing truth when the Mack
starts to mike it
I hope the subject don't turn ya away
But the whole Hip-Hop generation need to pray

Chorus
Whatcha gon do when God comes
You can front now, but when God comes
You can't get straped for when God comes
'cause you won't know how to act, when God comes

Now we all established dat Mack's new king
And the king for his people has to represent the 
right thing
Brothers in the ghetto stop genociding
'Cause same boat we riding, will do like the Poseidon
I watched the earth's cheese line get longer, I watch
Allegiance to Satan's army looking stronger
I watched drugs and guns take control
I even watched how the devil take the Black woman's soul
They ain't got respect no more
When your ass on the camera you ain't nothing but a whore
Ladies you need to help out your man,
Instead of frontin' at the club with a drink in your hand
The Black family is now pre-history
And we don't need psychic healing from Dionne Warwick
We all need to be down on our knees beggin' please
Lord help us shake this disease
And MC's don't take these rhymes for no joke,
Craig Mack pen is mightier than the sword
you stroke
So take heed to the words that I send,
'Cause on Judgement Day everey man must attend

Chorus

All our Black leaders are throwing on they war paint
I ain't seen a saint that might make me faint
How long can we sing that song
Knowing that the shit ya kicking brother is dead wrong
And don't figure Mack new to get started
'Cause flip out an old fat verse from get retarded
I'm talking from veteran chair prepare
MC's nightmare only there's no need to fear
Shape up ya Lord about to strike
With thunder claps that turn day into night
With something similar to Gabriel's horn
The first flag up my tribe of Judah's now been warn
Peace to Bad Boy for bring me here
People of the world presenting Mack this year
No need for fronting his time has almost came
And the last rhyme ya hear bears Craig Mack's name

Is another girl better than me

He said you don't ever know where life's gonna lead you

When you go ramblin' off down the track
Sometimes I wish I'd never left California
Then I couldn't want to go back

Recitation:
He said ""You know, I used to be a well-known country singer
Made my first record back in 1953
At one time Buck Owens was my lead guitar player

And ol' Hag once wrote a song about me""
I wish I could see Bakersfield
Where the oil wells are pumpin'
The oranges are bloomin'

And the grapevine winds down from the hill
When I close my eyes I can touch the clear skies
At the corner where I used to live

If you hear a voice a-whistlin'
Outside your window baby
It ain't a robin or a bluebird, it's me
If the postman brings a package
With big hearts on the wrapper
And you wonder who it came from, it's me

[Chorus]
Who loves you baby
Please don't think I'm crazy
If I go to the extreme
There ain't nothin' I won't do
To hear you say you love me too
Say it's me

If you see a plane fly over
Pullin' a big banner
And the letters spell I love you, it's me
If you hear a DJ
Send a love song out to your name
From a guy who's wild about you, it's me

He was covered with the evening news
Had a pair of old wool socks on his hands

It was freezing rain an spittin' snow
He was curled up behind some garbage cans
I was afraid that he was dead
I gave him a gentle shake
When he opened up his eyes
I said,""Old man are you ok?""

He said,""I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree""
I was runin' from some honey bees
Drip dryin' in the summer breeze
After jumpin' into Calico creek
I was walkin' down an old dirt road
Past a field of hay that had just been mowed
Man I wish you'd just left me alone
Cause I was almost home

Then he said,""I was comin' round the barn""
Bout the time he grabbed my arm
When I heard Momma holler son hurry up
I was close enough for my own nose
To smell fresh cobbler on the stove
When I saw daddy loadin' up the truck
Cane poles on the tailgate
Bobbers blowin' in the wind
Since July of '55
That's as close as I've been

And you need two arms still dying to hold you

And all the letters in the bottom of the drawer

Craig Morgan,"He grew up in a time,
When a third-grade education,
Was all the school you needed,
To work the family farm.

He'd take time off on Sunday,
Him and all his family,
warm a pew,
And give thanks to the Lord.

There was no gray, only black and white.
Didn't need no-one to tell him,
What was wrong or right.
'Cause he had God, Family, and Country.

He set aside his plow,
In early 1940,
Said goodbye to his small town,
And put on the Army green.

Hard Times on the front lines,
Writin' letters on wet paper,
Not one word about the awful things he'd seen.
His was a generation,

That answered without question.
They knew they had to win,
'Cause they were fightin' for...
God, Family, and Country.

On the coffee table,
Sits the family Bible,
Where just last year he added,
A little boy to the family tree.

There's the folded flag they gave us,
On the day he left us.
But the thing that I remember most,
Is the way that he...

Believed...
In God, Family, and Country...
Ohhh, we've got God...

And Country......","God, Family and Country"

Chips up or down, they could count on each other

They lived for the next final round, the cowboy and clown

From Denver to Dallas, to the Calgary stampede
They took all those towns, and a few in between
But it ended one night, in a West Texas town
The bulls either got faster, or old Crazy slowed down

Ball glove and fishing pole
Tree house, BB Gun, and Band-Aid covered knees

And cuttin' grass for the neighbors
Except for Widow Wilson; he cuts hers for free

He puts one tenth of his hard earned money
In the offering plate each Sunday by his own choice

Weekdays he tries to sleep late
Weekends he's up at day break
Him and Roy wadin' in Cotton Creek

You see one, you see the other
Cut one, and both of them would bleed
Tires screamed, but that old truck couldn't stop

He made a cross from scraps of lumber
And on it carved 'God Bless Old Roy'

An' there goes that tractor's radiator hose.

There ain't no tricks in his straw hat; he walks a quarter mile back.
Miss Rose hears him slam that ol' screen door.
What he sees as wasted time is a blessing in disguise,
Oh, he's cussin' what she's been prayin' for.

The day turned dark as night, and in her eyes he saw the light,
He hadn't taken the time to notice.
From Heaven, it poured down on that little old farm house,

Meet us out at party cove
Come on in the waters fine
Just idle on over, and toss us a line

There's the martins walking in
With that mean little freckle-faced kid
Who broke a window last week
Sweet miss Betty likes to sing off key
In the pew behind me

That's what I love about Sunday
Sing along as the choir sways
Every verse of amazing grace
And then we shake the preacher's hand
Go home into your blue jeans
Have some chicken and some baked beans
Pick a backyard football team
Not do much of anything
That's what I love about Sunday

I stroll to the end of the drive
Pick up the Sunday times, grab a coffee cup
Looks like sally and rob finally tied the knot
Well, it's about time
It's thirty-five cents off a ground round
Baby, cut that coupon out

That's what I love about Sunday
Cat-nappin' on a porch swing
You curled up next to me
The smell of jasmine wakes us up
Take a walk down a back road
Tackle box and a cane pole
Carve our names in that white oak
Steal a kiss as the sun fades

Havin' a hallelujah good time

Craig Morgan,"With skin as tough as a burlap sack he had his second heart attack last summer
But he's still goin'
There's a melancholy in his eyes, for all of you who care enough to wonder why
Let me tell you
It all started back in 1957 when ole Walt Disney took him by surprise
Thats the day Old Yeller died
Well that twelve year old became a man eleven years to soon in Vietnam
With his best friend Tommy
They were tough as nails and southern born and awfully proud to wear that uniform
Then things got scary
On April 4th, Tommy left for heaven the same year the world was taken by surprise
That's the day Martin Luther died
So before you judge him you need to know there's more to that old man
Then what you see there on that barstool with the bourbon on his hand
You heard about his younger years but don't leave now theres more to hear
That might explain the pain in that old man
How quick America forgot about the only war they'd lost and life goes on
That's what they tell ya
No ticker tape no reason why, might have never seen the end of that chapter in his life
If he hadn't met Betty
They married in December 1980, no doubt it was the best day of his life
Two days before John Lennon died
So before you judge him you need to know there's more to that old man
Than what you see there on the barstool with the bourbon in his hand
Now we've covered chapter two I can almost see a change in you
There's still a lot of life in that old man
He hadn't had a drink in at least a year, to tell the truth I'm shocked he's here
But as long as he wants'em I'm gonna pour'em
Before you came in I asked him why, he raised his fragile head and wiped his eyes
Then he told me
I've seen so much in my life I've never questioned, this time the good Lord took me by surprise
Yesterday my Betty died
With skin as tough as a burlap sack he had his second heart attack last summer
But he's still goin'",The Ballad of Mr. Jenkins

Storm blew a tree down in my backyard
My axe wouldn't cut it and my saw wouldn't start
Good excuse for a trip to the hardware store
To give that little hottie workin' a thrill de' jour
I know that she digs me 'cause when I walked in
Here she come a runnin' with a can I help you grin
Like a puppy on a leash she followed me around
I left her droolin' at the mouth when I walked out

Her blue eyes glued to my liberty coveralls
She didn't have a prayer
But I guess you had to be there

I'm pretty sure she meant to drop that can of W.D.
So I could see her bend over in her tight blue jeans
I was eye to eye with Taz and a Tweety tattoo
Forced to play a little game of peek-a-boo
Then she led me down the aisle by the pipe and glue
Asked me if I had any plumbing to do
Hands planted firm on the curve of her hip
Looked to me like she was lookin' for a little lip to lip

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
She even did that little finger thingy through her hair
Practically undressed me with her Playboy stare
I gave her back that look that she was lookin' for
I think that she forgot that we was in that store

It took a want add in the paper
To sell that '68 Firebird
And buy that diamond ring I gave her
And rent out that little church
It took the day my baby girl was born
To make a tear roll down my cheek
It took a woman to make a man out of me

It took a pair of soft blue eyes
And a smile so sweet
To make me reach up high
And really dig down deep
She's made me so much more than who I used to be

Craig Morgan,"We met when I was stationed at Fort Campbell.
Got married in the front yard at your dad's
I played guitar and sang my songs down at the hatchery

Then one day, we settled down to what we had
We made a picture perfect life together
Got memories in our head in every room
One day we'll be too old to do what we used to do
But I look forward to lookin' back with you

When we're sittin' on our front porch
In our cracker barrel rockers
And we don't long to dye the grey out of our hair
We'll sit and laugh and talk about all the things that we went through
Yeah, I look forward to looking back with you

I can't believe Ally's already driving
It wont be long until they both gone off to college
Yeah, I look forward to lookin' back with you

When my new truck is my old truck
And I take off these big old tires
And its our turn to slow down traffic everywhere
We'll spend our winters in a motor home parked down in Cancun
Yeah, I look forward to lookin' back with you

And if our maker comes and takes me
And leaves you here alone
Don't be sad because I won't be far away
Once again hand in hand we'll walk the far side of the moon

Craig Morgan,"You can't forget what love was wearing
When it walked out your front door
Where you fell down to your knees
And can't forget the kind of suitcase
That was packed out on the sidewalk
While you cried there beggin' please
But love remembers

You can lie and tell yourself
You're over it and someone else will take love's place
And this is for the best
You can lie in that bed
In a stranger's arms reachin' for comfort
Close your eyes and still get no rest

Cause love remembers
The smell of a summer day
Lying in a hammock over fresh cut grass
And the promise of forever
Yeah love remembers
The sound of the pouring rain
Beatin' down on the top of a car
On the side of the road
Where it couldn't wait
Yeah love remembers

You might convince yourself
There's shelter in a bottle
For a while there it might numb the pain
But when it hits you, then it hits you
That love's still gone and you'll be wishin'
That you'd poured it down the drain
'Cause love remembers

The taste of cotton candy lip gloss
On the lips of a long kiss
And the plans they made together
Yeah love remembers
To feel the fingertips
Running through soakin' wet hair
On the bank after a midnight swim
Yeah love remembers

Yeah love remembers
The smell of a summer day
Lying in a hammock over fresh cut grass
And the promise of forever
Love remembers
The sound of the pouring rain
Beating down on the top of a car

And break you till you got you got nothing at all

With water running under it
Flowing through my mind, takes me back in time

We'd stop by there and drop a tailgate
And take a dip to cool off a bit

We'd tear into a full igloo of Old Milwaukee's Best

And blankets on the ground

It seemed to take forever for the world to turn halfway around
Days were long and we were waitin' on a summer sundown

We'd park our pick ups on the bank
Build a bon fire and we'd crank our radios
Loud as they would go

Now and then, it never failed
Old man Baker'd start raisin' hell
About us being there, ah, but we didn't care

If he called the law the fun would end

To the top of white pine ridge
Burning like a summer sun

Hold up your cup and take another swig
Won't sleep til dawn, party right down to the wire

We all got a little nervous
It's too late to hide our cups

Now that this twister has taken all that's dear to you""

""Boy let me tell you something, this ain't nothing""

He said I lost my daddy, when I was eight years old,

In a no win situation in a place called Vietnam
And last year I watched my loving wife,
Of fifty years waste away and die
And I held her hand til her heart of gold stopped pumping,

There's things that matter and there's things that don't
So if you're waiting here for me to cry,
I hate to disappoint you boy, but I won't

Wiped the dirt off of it with the hand that he still had

We lost track of time
As we floated around

To be alone, honeysuckle sweetened up the midnight air

And that summer moon
Shinin’ like sunlight
Bouncin’ off your eyes
And lightin’ up mine
Just me and you
Pullin’ off on a back road
Blanket and a radio and that summer moon

Two young lovers cuddled up on a dropped tailgate
Half past late, couple Dixie cups, filled up to the brim
Footpath through the tall, white pines down to yellow creek
Neck deep, and wet clothes drip-drying on a willow limb

And that summer moon
Shinin’ like sunlight
Bouncin’ off your eyes
And lightin’ up mine
Just me and you
Pullin’ off on a back road
Blanket and a radio and that summer moon

I told your daddy we ran outta gas
He winked at me and kinda laughed
And said don’t you know that I tried that
On her mama’s dad way back when

That summer moon
Was shinin’ like sunlight
Bouncin’ off your eyes
And lightin’ up mine
Just like you
We pulled off on a back road
Blanket and a radio

And that summer moon
Shinin’ like sunlight
Bouncin’ off your eyes

Craig Morgan,"She got her smile on, dog'on nothing in the world's wrong
Rolling down a country road
She's my shotgun rider, I'm the lucky dog beside her
My lips are where her kisses go
She loves when we go to the river and get in the water
And buddy she is hotter than south Georgia in July
Man when I'm with her I can't get enough of her
I got to kiss her and I got to hug her
And brother she's mine all mine

This ole boy got it going on,
Got the good Lord smiling on me
Her big blue eyes and the sweet red wine
Got me buzzin' like a bee
She's got her pretty little head on my shoulder
Nobody else gets to hold her

We're in my old Ford oh Lord, holes in my floor board
But she don't seem to mind
We park in a hay field, fog up the windshield
My kind of killing time
She sweetens my tea and she butters my biscuit
I am who I am and buddy she gets it
I ain't gotta change a thing
I don't know if it could get any better
But man if it does then I reckon I better get to picking out a ring

Buys a drink, gives a wink  and then it goes too far.

Thought if I could catch a plane, touch down, out of town
Somewhere nobody knows you.
Maybe I could get myself half of a chance
To get alive and act a like a different man
But my best of intentions were all shot to hell
And I found myself hiding in a cheap hotel

Starin' at the T.V.
Tryin' not to sleep 'cause I'm just gonna wake up lovin' you

No word that I say will be true
I'm fine on my own except for I'm all alone.

Unsevered connections just holding too tight
End pretending thoughts stop sending surface his new home
Won't think to long he's incomplete without you

Down on your knees it's a long extra mile (letting go)
Giving your faith just for a smile

Your finding some way to go crawling back again
She wonders why her boy didn't run
Remembering two who had something special then
Sometime someday there'll be only one

The passages preached roused notions of warn
Elasticity reached allegiance near torn
And she's flying away to new foreign lands (hurting so)
Your searching for faults on grounds that you stand (letting go)
Without her the dream it ceases to be (letting go)
But tomorrow you'll wake and maybe you'll see

Your finding some way to stumble along again
We wonder why, why ever you've gone
Remembering two who had something special then
Just for today there'll be only one

One understanding one thought that she left you
One more that takes it one less that makes you whole
She's seeking the truth the words that she left
Your riddled by ask and all out of breath
Resounding the voice reconciled song
You've created the choice now will you stand strong

Your finding the way keep pushing along my friend

Craig's Brother,"Lying idle in my room, telling my thoughts to the moon:
Why do I always feel so unimportant?
To other egos my mind clings and inside these voices ring
That I'm just a carbon copy of everyone else

And now I'm searching out my own identity
Something down inside telling me that I'm like no one else but me
But as of yet I still don't know
Who is this guy that I am and for his life what does he have to show?
Who am I?
What am I for?

I wait for answers from the sky, the only audience I find
But no comfort finds my ears just silent mocking
And I know I was created but I just can't figure out why

And now I'm searching out my own identity
Something down inside telling me that I'm like no one else but me
But as of yet I still don't know
Who is this guy that I am and for his life what does he have to show?
Who am I?
What am I for?

Still searching. Who am I?
Some answers I don't ever find
I just want to know I have a place
Come from and return to dust,
But I don't want to feel that useless
I want to see something in me that is unique.
I just want to know. Who am I?
What am I for?

Fallen short of your neo-Victorian fantasy

So look at all your hard work is coming to
Despite your effort you still can't buy security

It seems that's when the second hand kicks in

We're held in chains at dawn

The streets are waiting in the dark
We're breakin out of fear n doubt
We stand up screamin on the walls
Nothings gonna hold us down
Waiting for that midnite call

This little girl, cryin' on the frozen night,
And he's back on the streets out to fight,
She wanted love but he let her down,
Hes running high with no turning around,

It's Myra Hindley on the cover,
Your very own sweet anti-mother.
There she is on the pages of The Star,
Ain't that just the place you wish you were?
Let her rot in hell is what you said,
Let her rot, let her starve, you'd see her dead.
Let her out but don't forget to tell you where she is,
The chance to screw her is a chance you wouldn't miss.
Let her suffer, give her pain is the verdict you gave,
You just can't wait to piss on her grave.
You pretend that you're horrified, make out that you care,
But really you wish that you had been there.
You say you can't bear the thought of what she did,
But you'd do it to her, you'd see her dead.
Tell me, what is the difference between her and you?
You say that you would kill her, well, what else would you do?
Don't you see that violence has no end? Isn't limited by rules?
Don't you see as angels preaching you're nothing but the fools?
Fools step in, where angels fear to tread,
You see, to kill others is the ethic of the dead.

She's the anti-mother, mother, mother is that you?

That single mug shot from the past
Ensures your fantasy can last and last.
It gives you the chance to air your hate
Because she got there first, you were too late.
Hindleys' crime was to do what others think,
Took her anger and her prejudice and pushed it to the brink.
Then you goodly christian people, with your sickly mask of love,
Would tear that woman limb from limb, you'd never get enough.
So you keep the story alive,
So you can make yourselves believe,
That you are so much better than her.

Crass,"Beg the question, bend the truth
Bail out the basement while there's holes in the roof

In the beginning they said there was light,
Well there ain't much left of it now.
We're lost in the darkness, searching sound and sight
Of an answer to the what, where or how.
We're talking 'bout freedom while we're locked in a cell,
Dreaming of a world without war,
Forced to live on the boundaries of hell
Like no-one's ever thought of peace before.
What's the point of preaching peace if it's something you don't feel?
What's the point of talking love if you think that love ain't real?
Where's the hope in hopelessness? Where's the truth in lies?
Don't try to hold my hand if you can't look me in the eyes.

Beg the question, bend the truth
Bail out the basement while there's holes in the roof

In the beginning they said there was light
But somebody's burnt out the fuse.
And now we're all lost in eternal night
Looking for a candle to use.
Lots of little candles, isolated hope,
Frail little flames in the gale,
Lost little people who just can't cope,
Just knocking their heads on the nail.
What's the point of talking freedom if you just protect yourself?
What's the point of preaching sharing as you accumulate your wealth?
It's so easy to be giving if the things you give ain't real.
It's so easy to lie if your ignore the things you feel.

Beg the question, bend the truth
Bail out the basement while there's holes in the roof

In the beginning they said there was light
But we never had the eyes to see.
But rather than struggling or putting up a fight
We ran like lemmings to the sea.
No-one really wants to get it all together,
It's easier to just grab what you can.
Everybody's going it, hell for leather,
Building little castles in the sand.
Hypocrisy, delusion, lies, pretence, deceit,
Think only of yourself and the world's at your feet
I don't believe the things you say, you make bullshit of the truth.
The game you play's offensive and you life's the living proof.

I'm tired of deceit, gonna put up a fight,
I'm going to use my own eyes.
Gonna make my decisions, live my own life,
They can keep their darkness and gloom.
Hypocrisy, trickery, I've had enough,
They can keep their destruction and doom.
I've only one life and I'll live it my way,
They can keep their restrictions and law.

Crass,"When you woke this morning you looked so rocky-eyed,
Blue and white normally, but strange ringed like that in black.
It doesn't get much better, your voice can get just ripped up shooting in vain,
Maybe someone hears what you say, but you're still on your own at night.
You've got to make such a noise to understand the silence.
Screaming like a jackass, ringing ears so you can't hear the silence
Even when it's there - like the wind seen from the window,
Seeing it, but not being touched by it.

(We never asked for war, nor in the innocence of our birth were we aware of it.
We never asked for war, nor in the struggle to realisation did we feel there was a need for it.
We never asked for war, nor in the joyful colours of our childhood were we conscious of its darkness.)

HOW DOES IT FEEL?
How does it feel to be the mother of a thousand death?
Young boys rest now, cold graves in cold earth.
How does it feel to be the mother of a thousand death?
Sunken eyes, lost now; empty sockets in futile death.

Your arrogance has gutted these bodies of life,
Your deceit fooled them that it was worth the sacrifice.
Your lies persuaded people to accept the wasted blood,
Your filthy pride cleansed you of the doubt you should have had.
You smile in the face of the death cause you are so proud and vain,
Your inhumanity stops you from realising the pain
That you inflicted, you determines, you created, you ordered -
It was your decision to have those young boys slaughtered.

You never wanted peace or solution,
From the start you lusted after war and destruction.
Your blood-soaked reason ruled out other choices,
Your mockery gagged more moderate voices.
So keen to play your bloody part, so impatient that your war be fought.
Iron Lady with your stone heart so eager that the lesson be taught
That you inflicted, you determines, you created, you ordered -
It was your decision to have those young boys slaughtered.

How does it feel to be the mother of a thousand death?
Young boys rest now, cold graves in cold earth.
How does it feel to be the mother of a thousand death?
Sunken eyes, lost now; empty sockets in futile death.

Throughout our history you and your kind
Have stolen the young bodies of the living
To be twisted and torn in filthy war.
What right have you to defile those birth?
What right have you to devour that flesh?
What right to spit on hope with the gory madness
That you inflicted, you determines, you created, you ordered -
It was your decision to have those young boys slaughtered.

How does it feel to be the mother of a thousand death?
Young boys rest now, cold graves in cold earth.
How does it feel to be the mother of a thousand death?
Sunken eyes, lost now; empty sockets in futile death.

You accuse us of disrespect for the dead,
But it was you who slaughtered out of national pride.
Just how much did you care? What respect did you have
As you sent those bodies to their communal grave?
You buried them rough-handed, they'd given you their all,
That once living flesh defiled in the hell
That you inflicted, you determines, you created, you ordered -
It was your decision to have those young boys slaughtered.

You use those deaths to achieve your ends still,
Using the corpses as a moral blackmail.
You say ""Think of what those young men gave""
As you try to bind us in your living death,
Yet we do think of them, ice cold and silence
In the snow covered moorlands, stopped by the violence
That you inflicted, you determines, you created, you ordered -
It was your decision to have those young boys slaughtered.

How does it feel to be the mother of a thousand death?
Young boys rest now, cold graves in cold earth.

They're just another showpiece to show the neighbours who
Can produce the perfect babe with everything in place,
But god help you if you come out without an angel face.
If you haven't got the looks that prove how nice you are,
You'll have failed your duty and that's all you fucking are,
You're just a status symbol that they need to have in life,
Just the proof they need to be the perfect man and wife.

And tell you all that life is, is working for some cash,
Life's a competition and you've got to be the best,
So tread on everybody else, forget about the rest.

Like tell you the conditions and pump it into you,
That you really mustn't fail them 'cause you owe them a debt,
'cause they're the ones that made you and they won't let you forget.

They don't want you thinking, you'll break the fantasy,
The fantasy that you're the toy providing endless fun,
You're not a human being, you're their daughter or their son.
You bring them lots of happiness when you're very small,
But when you lose those darling looks no-one cares to call,
'cause you're no more the cuddly toy for them to hug and hold,
You're not an individual and they're just getting old.

Exercising the hairy eyeball in May
I spied a startling example 
Of female she and I thus exchanged words
She smelled me and her VNO
In her nose told her our MHC genes agreed

Now when I speak of her coloration
I refer to the summation
Of all her principles and beliefs
This I endeavored to ignore
And now the situation
Can best be described as
Kaleidoscope what a beautiful form 

A summation of tangled emotion
A fixed series of changing phases
Seen through my kaleidoscope
My endeavoring proved to be my undoing
As she left me to my willful
Ignorance yet her legacy
Left for me is to be blinded by

Crazy Frog,"Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby do you recognize me?
Well it's been a year it doesn't surprise me
(Happy Christmas)

I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, ""I love you"", I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

A crowded room friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My god I thought you were someone to rely on
Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
Now I've found a real love
You'll never fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

I was petrified
Kept thinking I could never live
without you by my side
But I spent so many nights
thinking how you did me wrong
I grew strong
I learned how to carry on
and so you're back
from outer space
I just walked in to find you here
with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed my stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second
you'd be back to bother me

Go on now go walk out the door
just turn around now
'cause you're not welcome anymore
weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
you think I'd crumble
you think I'd lay down and die
Oh no, not I
I will survive
as long as i know how to love
I know I will stay alive
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give
and I'll survive
I will survive

It took all the strength I had
not to fall apart
kept trying hard to mend
the pieces of my broken heart
and I spent oh so many nights
just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry
Now I hold my head up high
and you see me
somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person
still in love with you
and so you felt like dropping in
and just expect me to be free
now I'm saving all my loving

Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby
All right stop
Collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Then I flow that a harpoon daily and nightly
Will it ever stop?
Yo, I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle

Dance
Bum rush the speaker that booms
I'm killin' your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly, when I play a dope melody
Anything less that the best is a felony
Love it or leave it
You better gain way
You better hit bull's eye 
The kid don't play

Yo, I'll solve it

Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in, the fingers are pumpin'
Quick to the point, to the point no faking
I'm cooking MC's like a pound of bacon
Burning them if they're not quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin in my 5.0
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby
Waving just to say hi
Did you stop?
No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
That block was dead

Yo so I continued to a1a Beachfront Ave
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rock man lovers driving Lamborghini
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps are acting ill because they're so full of eight balls
Gunshots ranged out like a bell
I grabbed my nine
All I heard were shells
Fallin' on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm tryin' to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene
You know what I mean
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem 
Yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla

Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town, that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed
This is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step with this
Shay plays on the fade, slice it like a ninja
Cut like a razor blade so fast
Other DJ's say, ""damn""
If my rhyme was a drug
I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem
Yo, I'll solve it!

It's a wonder tall trees ain't layin' down

You can't conceive of the pleasure in my smile
You hold my hand, buff up my hair
It's lots of fun to have you there

I'd like to know what you've learned
The sky is blue and so is the sea
What is the color when black is burned?
What is the color?

You pick me up and you lay me down again

Crazy Horse,"They were hiding behind hay bales,
They were planting in the full moon
They had given all they had for something new
But the light of day was on them,
They could see the thrashers coming
And the water shone like diamonds in the dew.

And I was just getting up, hit the road before it's light
Trying to catch an hour on the sun
When I saw those thrashers rolling by,
Looking more than two lanes wide
I was feelin' like my day had just begun.

Where the eagle glides ascending
There's an ancient river bending
Down the timeless gorge of changes
Where sleeplessness awaits
I searched out my companions,
Who were lost in crystal canyons
When the aimless blade of science
Slashed the pearly gates.

It was then I knew I'd had enough,
Burned my credit card for fuel
Headed out to where the pavement turns to sand
With a one-way ticket to the land of truth
And my suitcase in my hand
How I lost my friends I still don't understand.

They had the best selection,
They were poisoned with protection
There was nothing that they needed,
Nothing left to find
They were lost in rock formations
Or became park bench mutations
On the sidewalks and in the stations
They were waiting, waiting.

So I got bored and left them there,
They were just dead weight to me
Better down the road without that load
Brings back the time when I was eight or nine
I was watchin' my mama's T.V.,
It was that great Grand Canyon rescue episode.

Where the vulture glides descending
On an asphalt highway bending
Through libraries and museums, galaxies and stars
Down the windy halls of friendship
To the rose clipped by the bullwhip
The motel of lost companions
Waits with heated pool and bar.

But me I'm not stopping there,
Got my own row left to hoe
Just another line in the field of time
When the thrashers comes, I'll be stuck in the sun
Like the dinosaurs in shrines
But I'll know the time has come
To give what's mine.",Thrasher
Crazy Horse,"Gonna leave the pain behind
Gonna leave the fools in line
Gonna take the magic potion

Get my feet wet in the ocean

I'm still living in the dream we had,
For me it's not over...

Walkin on the bridge on day
Lookin out across the bay
I saw a rippling in the water
Once a big ship had passed
I borrowed a traveler's glass
And focused on the ocean's daughter
Kind of like a wave confused
Dancing in the sunset hews
She waved to me and called me over

I'm still living in the dream we had,
For me it's not over...

Talkin' bout a friend of mine
Talkin' bout a gold mine
Richest vein in any mountain
Talkin' bout the enemy

Talkin' bout eternity

This is the last trip.
CXT KRS-One
Boogie down, Crazy Town.

[Chorus]
I'm a bad ass B-Boy
Two triple O.
A space age hip-hop
Superhero

I rock the block with glocks
And brass knuckles.
A pocket full of weed
And a B-Boy belt buckle.
Space age rage
To rattle your cage
Running amok as we
Fuck up the stage.
Taking hip-hop to a whole new level.
8-0-8 bass over twisted metal.
Shifty, the rebel. Supernatural.
A mac with a pull.
Act a fool. Excalibur
Destroying M.C.'s with my
Vocal algebra.
We got something new for you.
For you to take your ass and move it to.
Hit to lose it to
It's that crazy crew.
Taking you on a ride to the
Other side.
Check it.
Bar codes on freaks
Programmed to freak mode.
Black holes of lost souls,
Let the story be told
I rock a B-Boy stance
'Cause it's time to explode.

[Chorus]

If you ever want to know what time it is,
Compared to what time it isn't,
When you hear KRS in the house
Just run and get our ticket.
Because when you come into the jam,
The party will be kickin'.
All the wic wacs and DJ's in the house,
Jealous, it gets so sickenin'.
Now CXT are some cool guys,
Still getting paid without no ties.
At least no jack and I can't hack it.
When you gonna ask the question why.
I never liked working at Mickey D's,
All my life I got B's and C's.
Down with the crew called BDP
Shifty, and E.P.I.C.
Now when you be?

It don't get better, gather

I roll at light speed
Through space and time
With a boom box of beats
And a book of rhymes.
Cosmo kinetic.
I just don't get it
These fools want to rock
But their rhymes are pathetic
The Epic, digital bliss,
The mega sound
Consists of hard drive bits
Written underground.
Crazy Town rocks so hard,
You'll go berserk
With the sound that travels
Around the universe.
Ill thoughts disperse
We're the first and last,
High class, white trash,
Rolling a classic hovercraft.
In strange days,
The wickedest ways
Become the norm.
But it's far from the norm
When we perform.
Check it.
B-boys make some noise.
Get connected.
Respect it.
You should expect the unexpected.
B-girls reping at the front
Of the show.
I'm a bad ass b-boy two
Triple O.

Dope thoughts come
When I hear a kick drum
A bass beat transforms
The level of the street
And the lyrics
Boulevard status.
Yo, I'm the baddest
Beach front punks,
They insist I'm the raddest
Thing to ever hit since L.S.D.
Hallucinate while I dominate.
I bring Satan to the table.
When I rock, there is not
A label for it.
Critics adore it.
Homicidal as it gets.
Your wrist slit
When I make suicidal imprints
On your brain.
I induce pain, so I'm insane.
Hell bent burnt you like acid rain.
Extraordinarily, I lyricize,
Specialize.
In body rocking, rapping,
And macking.
Two triple O, I came to get down.
With my clique Crazy Town.
We came to get down.
Yes, yes y'all
We came to get down.

Put your mind over matter
Gather 'round the sound

Gather 'round the sound

Crazy Town,"Now people say I'm jinxed
I got some kind of voodoo hex
Life is so complex
There's no telling what could happen next
Life on the edge,
Fuels the sickness in my head
It embeds the type of thoughts
That got a lot of brothers dead
The smarter brother knows
To keep his foes close
And I'm the type of brothers
That smarter than most
A cold hearted overdose
Of lyrical antidotes
The cure to make sure
My karma can't take me down
Up to the same old tricks
I wonder if I'll stick around

Is a penny really lucky
If you find it on the ground?
I can't figure it out
My karma crashing down
In the form of a black cloud

[Chorus: x2]
I've got a little black cloud,
That follows me
Everywhere I go
It takes over me

I'm sick
I've got an ill disposition
My intentions are pure
But there's a cure for my condition
My decisions
Put me in the wrong positions
Chasing pipe dreams
Of fame and recognition
The Epic
Not only a name
A definition
My game remains no matter the pain
I stay a charmer
The Don of Karma
I navigate like the Dalli Lama
I ain't a saint
But I've got joi de vie
And I'm the one to blame
If the cloud rains on me
I can't complain about it
Or even let regret
Provoke the energy it takes
For me to get upset

A bad boy since birth
So I can't forget
what goes around
Comes around
And it ain't got me yet
I've gotten wise in my age
And tame the treat of my rage
I've got allot to learn
And I've got money to spend
To pretend is reaping more
Than sewing ever could mend

[Chorus]

Trade my torches for a dime
Black cloud's lifted for the light
The pressure's fading away now
A thousands cigarettes
Won't change the way we feel
The pressure's fading now
Can you bare the though of knowing truth?
Knowing truth?

I was rapping in the rain
Hoping that my luck would change
And if there's any truth
To all those all sayings
'Cause if I kill a spider
Would my house catch on fire?
If I walk under a ladder
Would it matter?
I tend to laugh
When a black cats cross my path
Break mirrors in half
Just to test the aftermath
Now here comes the rain
I protect my pain
Trying to make sense
Of these crazy things
I'm a diamond in the rough
Could I suffer enough?
I'm getting high for a living
Not giving a fuck
These hard times got me stuck
Stuck in a jam
Disastrous
Took time to master this
And the past
Is just a map to capture this
In the darkness
I'm force to adapt to this
I would change the past
If I could have one wish

You made me feel alive when I was almost dead

And fingers snapping

The giant scientist of hits that make you jump like a lunatic
On pogo sticks, waving your fists

Warned you about
I'm known for taking ladies home
And turning them out.
Like kissing all the girlies and
Making them cry.
I'm a wise guy with wits
The opposite of shy
Make your girl's pussy shiver
When she looks in my eyes.
So uh.
One's for the money,
Two's for the honeys
Three's for the pimp's players
And the playboy bunnies.
You best believe I throw down.
Ain't no need to slow down
You name the place and the time.
Find Mr. Shifty at the showdown.
Tearing you up.
That's why all the fly girls
Just can't get enough.
Said I loved you,
And you believed it was true.
That's hilarious.
But your mother should have
Warned you about
Guys like us.

'Cause players only love you
When we're playing

Now players only love you
When we're playing.

They will come
And they will go.
And all you players know just
What I'm saying
It's amazing just how many
Girls we know.

I know it ain't right.
But I don't want to change.
I've got so many dames,
I can't remember their names.
But don't be confused,
'Cause girls are players too.
So, we're going to tell you
About a girl we knew.
She was a pretty rebel.
A punk rock girl.
With a wicked sex drive
And the mind of a devil.
Like Agent 99,
Under cover all the time.
You want another kiss
You better rack another line.
Unique in design,
This freak was kind of fine.
But she's not the only one.
There's plenty of her kind.
Ain't nothing funny baby,
Her game's so tight,
She can make the sun shine
In the middle of the night.
She knows what she wants
And she gets it when
She wants it.
She knows that you want it
She's got it, so she flaunts it.
So, get up on it.
You know the old saying.
Players only love you
When they're playing.

Only the strong survive
I come alive and hit my mark.
The after dark player caper
Can't lie, I'm on the take.
A heartbreaker tonight.
The ladies call me Mr. Right.
And others call me a freak.
Girl, it's okay if you bite.
Some like it violent.
Mr. Mysterious type
Strong and silent
King player
I cast a hex
Inebriated talk of sex.

(Epic, I'm so into you)

Manipulation
I'm talking triple X rated
Sophisticated,
I'm game to elevate your mind.
An understated flirt
The chemistry's hot.
You can't deny.
So realize the size of it.
I can see it in your eyes.
I'd love to touch you baby.
And taste the essence of you.

You want to play?
Now, let me hear you scream
Out my name.
Players only love you when
They're playing.

Now ladies come, ladies go,
Out my revolving door
Some ladies never come back,
Most come back for more.
I've got a house in the hills
With a door that spins.
Goes in and out,
Out and in,
'Round and 'round again.

I live a life these player haters
Would love to be living.
Since a kid, I've been surrounded
By beautiful women.
And slippin' in them
To win them
The unforgiven.
Still something's missing,
'Cause deep inside I'm suffering
Of a lonely heart condition.
Wishing I could find a girl
That would take me away
From the chaos of the city
And the everyday part that I play.
Tell me why lay low,
Why say no
When I got girls serenading at
My window.
Ladies good to go
We's major league
The new breed. No so-so.
Highly advanced and got the game
To get in any girl's pants.
And romance her stone
'Cause I more than hold my own
They call me Shifty Capone
I make them moan
Yes, I'm the one.
Between the sheets,
I amaze and stun.
Ain't no need for me to brag
About the way that I'm hung.
Let's just say I got the skills
To get the flyest girl sprung.
Or to take and make
An older lady feel young.

[Chorus]

I keep my girls in rotation,
Door rotating.
You looking for a good time,
I'm always on vacation.
You could stop by baby,
If you want to try your luck.
But don't waste my time,
Unless you're down to fuck.
Unless you're coming back for more,
Well then you know what's up.
You know the routine
Girl, you're not the one.
You're just a one night fling.
Some ass to hold this Casanova over.
Till the right girl pass,
I'll drop this lifestyle fast.
'Cause what I'm really looking for
Is the one will last
And make my present past.
My adolescence surpassed.
By the will to chill,
I'm looking for something real.
In a world of fake hos in high heels
I'll drop hot wax on your nipples,
Causing trouble.
And when you ride me,
Yo, I'll be throwing up that triple double
My sex drive's kicking.
I'm sexually exploring.
So many possibilities,
It seems my life could never get boring.
'Cause I'm not fucking around.
I'll rub you down the right way.
I'll rock your world nightly.
So, can I hit it lightly?
Yo, girl, I like it like that.
Let me hit it from the back.
I'm a natural aphrodisiac.
Better known as a Mac.

Of it's own and it's toxic

The sound of heavy metal that tastes like cellophane
Collapsing every vein like umbrellas in heavy rain
My passion is pain
I do dirt to bury shame
I'm victimized an institution's no solution
A place where you're defenseless and guilt's the prosecution
Where necks are bound into slipknots of shallow souls
Walking narrow roads to be hung from gallows poles
Nobody knows me success has exposed me
To narrow-minded souls with goals to overthrow me
Suppose that I chose to live my life low-key
Would you act like you could teach
When there is nothing you can show me
Don't you understand I'm the head of the class
A straight A student not regretting the past

[CHORUS]
You see I'm okay now but I don't think it will last
Because reality is something I can't seem to grasp
Candy-coated pain is like a ball and chain
Pulling me closer to death, I feel closer to death now
Candy-coated pain is like a ball and chain
We only dig deeper by running away

It's deeper than what it looks like
We never got an equal shot so we took mics
Packed the candy-coated pain in the first pipe
That said my name and the candy-coated pain is the worst type
You got it nice my every day is like your worst night
The world is digging in my wounds screaming out I bet it hurts right?
But it hurts more I got regrets but
I'm glad I took the prize behind the first door
What's the hurt for?
Everybody hungers peace but they thirst war
It's crazy I'm not complaining because I probably would have tried better
And if the people that I trusted weren't lie tellers
So keep your candy-coated pain to make the vibe better
Now all the songs I'm writing sound like suicide letters

[Chorus]

Guilty or innocent whatever pick the verdict
Sometimes a perfect picture's not so perfect
Thought I could reverse the mixture it isn't worth it
Because my life seems to work no matter how bad curse it
I only know a little but I feel so much
The pain brings me down but it reveals the rush
See I got my arms up just to shield the dust
Because I lust for the things I can't seem to touch
Arrest me if I follow you
You congest me I'm so hollow from your gift
You infect me when I cut you
Still the same still insane
I think I love you

Stereotypical minds 
Got me falling from my pinnacle the minute I climb 
Now these subliminal thoughts got individuals blind 
I'm trying to look beyond the lies 
Just to see what I'll find 
I'm like a flower in a cave 
Another hour in the maze 
And I'll cower to the power of my criminal ways 
The sun is shining but I'm catching minimal rays 
It's time for me to grow out of this childish phase 
My life is like a battle that I'll probably never win 
'Cause I keep thinking big and risking everything 
Life's a challenge and I wonder if I'll ever find the balance 
Mixed emotions and confusion topped off with many talents

Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever change 
Can I change 
Would I change 
Or am I always gonna be the same 
I blame the world for making me such a freak 
But the world wants to blame it on me 
(my life is twisted) 

My finger's pointing in the mirror 
I'm the one now 
I see my shadow in the sun dial 
Am I really out of change 
Put my freedom in a cage 
Slow down 
Man I got a son now 
There's nothing new they all said it 
And I know it but I had to go through it myself 
I'm hard-headed 
That's the only way I'll learn 
Get caught in the fire there's no escaping the burn 
And it burns 
Change this 
Change that 
Change is full of lies 
I remain the same cat wear a good disguise 
Living life looking through my third blind crooked eye 
So if I change I'd be changing for the worst wouldn't I?

I want to run but if I run I'm only running form myself 
Would it be easier if I were someone else 
I'm like a child playin' with matches that's never been burned

On a highway to a destinatin I've earned 
So many exits, but I've never bothered to turn 
I'm like a piece of shard glass laying on a frame of a window 
That was broken by the bricks of pain 
Sometimes I feel just like the devil's guinea pig

Clenched fists as I pace the yard 
So many tattoos I ain't got no room for scars 
Escaped them all make a brother break the law 
Skip trial and escape tomorrow 
Til I end up in the courtroom 
White chucks, hair spiked up 
With my double fat laces on 
And I want this game over 
It's a fight to let this life pass by you 
And try to stay sober 
Till the weed and the pipe with Ley come over 
Till we fail again its pales of hen 
So many tattoos the feds can't see my skin 
So I think about my cell again 
And my friends do you realize what kind of hell I'm in 

[Chorus:]
And I got the pills for the pain the pain (pills for the pain) 
Deep down inside I've got to chill and refrain (I'm going insane) 
These crazy thoughts are running round my brain 
They're leading me to places decorated in flames 
Dec-dec-dec-dec-dec-dec-decorated in flames 
I'm highly decorated 
Decorated in flames, decorated in flames, decorated in flames 

Tire tracks running down my veins 
Dirty black slacks with the chrome hearts changing 
Got a record so dope they got to cut it the cane 
I know you know the face do you know the name 
I know you seen the stars in magazines 
Got drug dealers, street hookers, crooks and fiends 
Me I'm hooked on Kush smoking northern green 
Catching cheap thrills off the pills I fiend",Decorated
Crazy Town,"Everything is so complex
Everyday is like a test
For the obstacles that seem most impossible

And I'm thinking, just another breath.
Not a minute left, how long have I been drifting!.

Pass the glass pipe, hit the flashlight, now I break it
People say I'm a star, but I still think I'll never make it

And I'm thinking, just another prayer.
Not a second left. I feel there's something missing.

Sometimes I hate that chaos surrounds me
When all the answers that I seek are around me
Am I drowning, am I fading away,
Or am I living up to all your dreams that made me this way
Am I drowning, am I drowning, am I drowning, am I drowning..

I've been to hell and back, looking for the answers to life. 
Looking at myself trying to get things right

And I'm feeling, just another breath.
Not a minute left, I feel the darkness lifting!

There was a time that I questioned if I'll ever be all right
Running getting high, staying tracked by sleepless nights

And I'm thinking, just another breath.
Not a minute left. I feel there's something missing.

I'm running from myself and all the things I don't like.
Living every night like it's the last night.

And I'm thinking. just another prayer.
Not a second left. I need to stop resisting.

Sometimes I hate that chaos surrounds me
When all the answers that I seek are around me
Am I drowning, am I fading away,
Or am I living up to all your dreams that made me this way
Am I drowning, am I drowning, am I drowning, am I drowning

Drowning in the drama, lost in the light
Trapped by the currents of life, caught in the riptide.",Drowning
Crazy Town,"Now let me state it for the record 
I'm jaded but when you looked at me 
I couldn't escape it 
I really hate it when I'm out of control 
But baby after the show 
My mind just wouldn't let go 
Tell me was it a hallucination 
That made me feel so alone 
And even though I have never met you before 
I can't get you out of my head 
Now I'm pouring out my heart for you 

[Chorus]
I never meant to hurt you so bad 
I'm just trying to get over you 
I hope you never meant to hurt me so bad 
Don't you feel the same way too 

So now I sit and think of what I can say 
When you look at me to re-ignite the connection 
I'm gonna take you to a place beyond time 
Somewhere that we've never been 
Someplace that I couldn't find 
Tell me if you're feeling my addiction 
Without you I just can't disguise 
How much I need to see your face one more time 
I can't get you out of my head 
Now I'm pouring out my heart for you

Crazy Town,"[Chorus]
I was a skull in the ground now I'm a star in the sky 
I went from crawling around to being able to fly 
Saw no future for me until I opened my eyes 
I was a skull in the ground now I'm a star in the sky 

I tried love, heaven, hope and takin' chances 
And all I got were broken dreams and failed romances 
Suffered to a life of skin covered in scratches 
Looking for the light but I could never find the passage 
Tension, stress, pain yeah you best believe it 
Nose bleeding from my false way to relieve it 
Enough confusion to make serenity sick 
All my fake friends became my enemies quick 
Everyday I found another way to make excuses 
Took the ropes I was supposed to climb and made nooses 
Being stupid always giving in to the myth 
That life wasn't even worth living like this 
A grown man trapped inside a young man's skin 
With resentment very very deep within 
On a mission to end up either dead or in jail 
No wonder everybody always said that I would fail 

[Chorus: x2]

I found myself locked in a cell and I was just another number 
The thin ice was cracking and I was sinking under, in with sorrow 
Worried 'bout today dread would happen by tomorrow 
Who knows the answers well nobody knows for certain 
The evil things I did when I chose to close the curtain 
Perhaps I should relapse quit relapse quit 
Force it back and relax with a sack of good shit 
Now I find myself in a candlelit depression 
Using sex like drugs just to handle my aggression 

[Chorus: x2]

i had a little, had a lot, had it all and then I lost it 
Stars are in my eyes and skeletons are in my closet 
Now when I open my eyes and I rise from the dead 
Take control of my soul cause the lies are in my head 
The right way is the left way and the left way is wrong 
So I'm left with the right way and the right way is long 
So for once in my life I truly feel like I belong 
So I'll appreciate today and every day until I'm gone

I was a skull in the ground now I'm a star in the sky",Skulls and Stars

Maybe I could, but then again.

I said when I'd grow up I'd be a bad motherfucker
Nothings gonna stop me now, I'm breaking the rules
I'm gonna do it if it's not allowed
Thought I wouldn't when I would, would when I wouldn't
I did it for the reason everybody said I couldn't
I'm putting my best foot down like what now
Lets take it to the bridge and jump the fuck down
Fuck it like a clown jump off a building in a bucket
The worst is yet to come, here it comes so bum rush it

Would you jump off a bridge if I told you to
Would you change the way you live if I told you to
Would you jump off a bridge if I told you to
Well take it to the bridge and jump the fuck off [2x]

Are you ready to jump? Are you ready to leap? 
Well the head rush is heavy but for many too deep
I ain't said much too many but the words on the street
That were speeding up the world to keep the timing on beat
It keeps reminding everybody who's a pyramid freak
The pyramid eye, the figure inside
The leader that you follow the day that you die
We always bring it live which makes it easy to choose
Ain't now grieving or consoling or singing the blues
So when the levee breaks just remember the drums
And when the levee breaks don't forget how to run
Remember what I've done and everything I say
I'm living proof that you can jump and live to try it again

Would you jump off a bridge if I told you to
Would you change the way you live if I told you to
Would you jump off a bridge if I told you to
Well take it to the bridge and jump the fuck off [2x]

I'm torn like Korn playing follow the leader
In a baggy pair of dickies and a dirty wife beater
Should the rate a CD like a movie in a theater
Should they blame it on me? I say we blame it on you
Or blame it on the world there's no excuse for the things we do
Life's a maze I'll be amazed if I find my way through
One, two, tell me whatchya gonna
You gonna jump off the bridge like I told ya to
That's right, bum rush the stage
Whatchya made of, how much more can you take
Half of my life's been one big mistake
But no ones gonna take my place
One, two, tell me whatchya gonna do
Your gonna jump off the bridge like I told you to
That's right, bum rush the stage 
What you made of? how much can you take

And the Bentley driving guru is putting up his price.

With jingle bells and fairy tales and blind colliding scopes
And you can tell they're all the same underneath the pretty lies.

Cream,"In the white room with black curtains near the station
Black roof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings
Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes
Dawn light smiles on you leaving, my contentment

I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines
Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves

You said no strings could secure you at the station
Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows
I walked into such a sad time at the station
As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning

I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back
Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves

At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd
Consolation for the old wound now forgotten
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes
She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings

I'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd
Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves",White Room [DVD]

Hold it down,
Big man big man,

You gotta watch out for them suckas, you gotta watch out for them now

[First Verse]
Big man, big man, hol it down,
It's been a long time since I been out on the town,
I'm in Memphis, T now,
So I hope you gettin' READY,
I hold 'em ALL DOWN when your homies act shady,
Somebody told TEDDY, the fool was makin' cheese,
Beware of all them haters and beware your enemies,
And we all makin' cheese, and we all keep it real,
And don't want to be your friend, since you got your ass hit,
But when your pockets were bloated, you thought you was a dude,
You fired up the CREW,
And wouldn't let us THROUGH,
You need to listen to your FOLKS, 'cause they the ones who's real,
I'll be down for you homie, when my brain got peeled,
But when your blood spill, who gone be around?
I know it ain't gone be them haters 'cause they ain't never hold it down,
But I'ma ride for ya homie,
And die for ya homie,
And if you get gone, then I'ma cry for ya homie,
You gotta keep it REAL on the real, when you sell your rounds,
And set up like a BIG MAN, and HOLD IT DOWN!!!

[Second Verse]
HEY BIG MAN BIG MAN, WHERE YOU FIXIN' TO GO???!!!!!!
I'll make you a thousand dollars with my million dollar shows,
I'm hittin' out of town, I got to hold it down,
The only way I gotta do it, 'cause ain't no slob in me now,
'cause when I ran it out, see I was a drug dealer,
But now that I'm on the ground, I'm breakin' bread and countin' figures,
Yeah Cream on the scene with a pocket full of green,
Need the money and the power just to keep it from the fiends,
'cause I'm gettin' crack served,
And the police tryin' to get me,
And lookin' at my STEREO because my windows too tinted,
Lord help me 'cause they CRAZY,
Pray for your BABY,
But that don't mean a damned thing 'cause my pockets they be payin' me,
I made it through them good times and them bad times,
We be makin' a lil' dough, but they still want to take it,
Now hook up on them boys, ain't nobody gone tell 'em different,
I'm the big man, big man, so hold it down tricks

Know I got that feeling that the pimp gone make a killin'
Droppin' them bodies off by the dozen I wouldn't mind, makin' a zillion
'cause there ain't no love, like that love that's on the down low
Always watch your back, for some of them niggas they call your kinfolk
I'd rather be broke, then one of them niggas that's on the board
Every option that I got, got me livin' by the ????
Over here, givin' a toast, to some of the niggas that did they dirt
Nothin' wrong with recognizin' the real, fightin' and puttin' in work
I got some things I need to do, in the pursuit, in my one lifetime
And ain't no more two-stompin' me, only grant for makin' my grind
And I'ma get in, where I fit in my nigga, we both can roll, for the ride
Sleepin' your head, 
and nigga you fall to your knees when it's time to compromise
I'm at the point of no return, only concerned with the fact
Know that I feel with this hustlin' two thousand trick, 
tryin' to hold you back
On the bow, leanin' with one foot ahead and the bow, is bound to break
No more shots, no more pop, 
because he's dead and it's time for the paper chase

Now shoot them toys wit'cha boy, 'cause you know we on the scene

You fuckin' around with me and Cream gone do this shit today
Now get it crunk wit'cha boy, don't front on your boy
And if you thuggin' up in the gates, let me see you get it up
Now hold it down with your nigga, when you smokin' up in the truck
'cause you claim that you smoke pound, but you might get your shit smoked up

Go and get some plastic toys I think somebody tryin' to get me

Everybody be smokin' a pound, with the Cream on the scene
Don't make me get crunk on ya boy, 'cause real niggas they move in silence
I've been known for shootin' them toys in case them suckas want to get violent
Now what'cha want from your boy? Cream olde English and some of this weed
Turnin' all of my enemies into manipulatin' fiends
But if you want it, you can get it
If you smoke it, two can hit it
I ain't perpetratin' with it
I'm gone hit it until it's finished
And just like Popeye eat his spinach, I'ma stay crunk off this all day
I don't care what the people say, WEED make my paper straight
So HOLD IT DOWN wit'cha boy, don't hesitate to get 'em up
Go head and smoke up what you smoked up 'cause today we gettin' fucked up
We smoke a pound up in my chevy, rollin' round we makin' credits
I ain't messed up bout no change
We havin' thangs and I'ma remain the same
On top of the game, you niggas just can't get crunk up like my crew do

But she'emm may you down, hold you close
'Neath her wings it's alright she'll take care of you

He left no room to turn around and change

Cree Summer,"You must think like goes on forever
The way you bide your time
The way you talk too much
The way you stop trying

You believe life goes on forever
The way that the sun sets
The way you feed the fear
The way that you regress

Life after life goes on 
Until it bors you to a death
Even more frightening than being alive
You pretend life goes on forever a
And a day wasting away

You must think like goes on forever
The way you let it slip away
The way you hide the way you feel
The way you don't feel what you say

Catering to the complacent habit forming insecure
May the circle be unbroken

Like I'm grieving for something I've never had

It's the child who's crying for the woman

I can see chaos heading straight for me
Give me the dark night, let the sun ignore me
'Cause everything's alright even what ain't good for me

I'll smooth my heart down, long enough
For the world to come around
Smooth my heart down, long enough
For the world to come around

It's a good journey, I'm in no hurry
Not looking for handouts, don't need no glory
Leave my conditions, keep my edges blurry
I got nothing to hold to, I can't stay gracefully

I'll smooth my heart down, long enough
For the world to come around
Smooth my heart down, long enough
For the world to come around

Smooth my heart down, long enough
For the world to come around
Smooth my heart down, long enough
For the world to come around

Make my silence softer
Take the thrill of my anger
May I sleep through the heat
And wake up a stranger

I'll smooth my heart down, long enough
For the world to come around
Smooth my heart down, long enough
For the world to come around

Smooth my heart down, long enough
For the world to come around
Smooth my heart down, long enough
For the world to come around

Cree Summer,"Had a friend once upon a time who had a hunger to learn
Good and bad was all she had and all she was concerned
She found out they were one and the same

The truth don't need to have a name
She loved to share with the moon soon she shared with me
The adventure this life could be
If we just let ourselves be free

She gave me peace of mind
Like a butterfly song to a rainbow shrine
And today feels good

We never answered too much we asked all the time
Why it was always looking and what there was to find
We threw it all into the wind laughter sharing
Me and my best friend

Her voice was fine and it eased my soul
Her face was young but her eyes were old
And magic would unfold
We worship the goddess of the earth

Daughter of life, mother of birth
We belong where the mystic is strong
Humming a butterfly song

And today feels good soul sister",Soul Sister
Cree Summer,"Couldn't find where to rub myself
I didn't want to close my eyes
I would scream just to shake myself
Just to wake myself inside

Broken into human parts I was sheltered by his chin
Lives spent in wet cement underneath his skin

Still on my neck the breath of the dead
Even as blood and bone
I can tolerate a still heart
But I can't stand being alone

Open me up anywhere you wish
Take out anything you like
Seal me up when you're through
Leave a little room for surprise
Made myself new one too many times
To swallow his breath away
I left too much space upon my back
To ever make him want to stay

Still on my neck the breath of the dead
Even as blood and bone
I can tolerate a still heart
But I can't stand being alone",Still Heart
Cree Summer,"Stuff myself into your reason
I lie real close and cling
I'd get small I'd even crawl
For the madness you would bring

Find comfort in your tangled words
I'd be sharper than your grief
I'd gather up into the dust of all your fears
And live in the corners of what you believe

I'd conjure up a second heart
To house your sweet pain
I'd love you so hard other folks
Won't have to strain to hear
I'd become your shadow
And haunt for just a taste of your want

This sickness is a mutant bliss
It's a slow steady  shrinking into thinking
I'd evaporate without your hate
To remind me I'm still here

I'd conjure up a second heart
To house your sweet pain
I'd love you so hard other folks
Won't have to strain to hear

I'd become your shadow
And haunt for just a taste of your want

More than any other could
I would love you",Sweet Pain
Creed,"When dreaming I'm guided to another world 
Time and time again 
At sunrise I fight to stay asleep 
'Cause I don't want to leave the comfort of this place 
'Cause there's a hunger, a longing to escape 
From the life I live when I'm awake
So let's go there 
Let's make our escape 
Come on, let's go there 
Let's ask can we stay? 

Can you take me higher? 
To the place where blind men see 
Can you take me higher? 
To the place with golden streets 

Although I would like our world to change 
It helps me to appreciate 
Those nights and those dreams 
But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights 
If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same 
The only difference is 
To let love replace all our hate 
So let's go there 
Let's make our escape 
Come on, let's go there 
Let's ask can we stay? 

Can you take me higher? 
To the place where blind men see 
Can you take me higher? 
To the place with golden streets

Up high I feel like I'm alive for the very first time 
Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams 
And make them mine",Higher [Live on Letterman]

Violent sons make bitter mothers

Creed,"I spent a day by the river
It was quiet and the wind stood still
I spent some time with nature

And remember that you feel
I said it's funny how silence speaks sometimes when you're alone
And remember that you feel
Again I stand, lord I stand
Against the faceless man
Again I stand, lord I stand
Against the faceless man

Now I saw a face on the water
It looked humble but willing to fight
I saw the will of a warrior
His yoke is easy and his burden is light

He looked me right in the eyes
Direct and concise to remind me
To always do what's right
He looked me right in the eyes
Direct and concise to remind me
To always do what's right

Again I stand, lord I stand
Against the faceless man
Again I stand, lord, god I stand
Against the faceless man

'Cause if the face inside can't see the light
I know I'll have to walk alone
And if I walk alone to the other side
I know I might not make it home

Again I stand, lord I stand
Against the faceless man
Again I stand, lord I stand
Against the faceless man

Next time I see this face
I'll say I choose to live for always
So won't you come inside and never go away
Next time I see this face

Creed,"When dreaming I'm guided to another world
Time and time again
At sunrise I fight to stay asleep
'Cause I don't want to leave the comfort of this place
'Cause there's a hunger, a longing to escape
From the life I live when I'm awake
So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask can we stay?

Can you take me higher?
To the place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To the place with golden streets

Although I would like our world to change
It helps me to appreciate
Those nights and those dreams
But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights
If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same
The only difference is
To let love replace all our hate
So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask can we stay?

Can you take me higher?
To the place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?

Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams
And make them mine

And no one else is there
Waiting by the phone
To remind me
I'm still here
When shadows paint the scenes
Where spotlights used to fall
And I'm left wondering
Is it really worth it all?

There's a peace inside us all
Let it be your friend
It will help you carry on, in the end
There's a peace inside us all

Life can hold you down
When you're not looking up
Can't you hear the sounds?
Hearts beating out loud
Although the names change
Inside we're all the same
Why can't we tear down these walls?
To show the scars we're covering

There's a peace inside us all
Let it be your friend

Creed,"Hands on a window pane
Watching some children laugh and play
They're running in circles
With candy canes and french braids
Inspired to question
What makes us grown-ups anyway?
Let's search for the moment
When youth betrayed itself to age

So let the children play
Inside your heart always
And death you will defy
'Cause your youth will never die
Never die

In searching for substance
We're clouded by struggle's haze
Remember the meaning
Of playing out in the rain
We swim in the fountain
Of youth's timeless maze
If you drink the water
Your youth will never fade
So let the children play
Inside your heart always
And death you will defy
'Cause your youth will never die
Never die
Never die
Never die

I won't let go of that youthful soul
Despite body and mind my youth will never die
I won't let go of that youthful soul
Despite body and mind my youth will never die

Inside your heart always
And death you will defy

Creed,"The dust has finally settled on the field of human clay

One early morning
She showed her crown of thorns
She whispered softly
To tell a story
About how she had been wronged
As she lay lifeless
He stole her innocence
And this is how she carried on
This is how she carried on

Well I guess she closed her eyes
And just imagined everything's alright
But she could not hide her tears
'Cause they were sent to wash away those years
They were sent to wash away those years

My anger's violent
But still I'm silent
When tragedy strikes at home
I know this decadence is shared by millions

And we labor in between
In life there are many quotients
And I hope I find the mean
The mean, the mean

Creed,"I can't find the rhyme in all my reason
I've lost sense of time and all seasons
Feel I've been beaten down

By the words of men who have no grounds
Can't sleep beneath the trees of wisdom
When your ax has cut the roots that feed them

Forked tongues in bitter mouths
Can drive a man to bleed from inside out

What if you did?
What if you lied?
What if I avenge?
What if eye for an eye?

I've seen the wicked fruit of your vine
Destroy the man who lacks a strong mind
Human pride sings a vengeful song
Inspired by the times you've been walked on
My stage is shared by many millions
Who lift their hands up high because they feel this

We are one we are strong
The more you hold us down the more we press on

What if you did?
What if you lied?
What if I avenge?
What if eye for an eye?

But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then Is this the end?

Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then Is this the end?

Sometimes I be wakin up at high noon
sayin, ""Why me Lord?"" -- folks thinkin I'ma die soon
I just tell em keep seekin, but when they sleepin
I be concealed up in my room, knowin that it could happen
I'm just tryin to maintin, because the future is untold
till the static unfolds that the good die young
Please God let a Bad Boy die old
Do you think I wanna lie cold
Or better yet have many shots come close to the head
Shirt soaked til it's red
The most that was said was that my homies had a toast to the dead
Do I need a pack a vest for stress so I can rest
Cause even though I'm blessed in my flesh
It all came down to a test
A motherfucker wanna go and put a tattoo on my chest
Now I'm caught up in the mix and I can't do shit, but still
I can't ride with program, fearing no man
Hit the car door let the door slam it's a blessing that he had slow hands
But he's still right behind me
All these heartless fools is steady comin after my P
So many phony niggaz lovin to hate Sean
So many cheddar niggaz comin after my cheese
Is it my car that they're losin, are we all for the choosin?
Or is it all in confusion?  Better yet all an illusion
Shots rang through the hall bullets cruisin for bruisin
Don't let this heartless bastard take my life away
I don't wanna conceive takin his either
Dipped into the back and took a breather
Heard steps steady in closin with the bullet skeezer
Gotta do somethin, I ain't scared to go
but yet my heart is steady pumpin for somethin
I refuse to be the one that they be dumpin
Gotta get away before the techs start gunnin
Bodies start jumpin, wreckin my brain not to try and understand
but withstand, is it cause I'm a rich man
Or just to try to put a brother down in the dirt like quicksand
But no matter what the reason, I don't wanna stop breathin
There's dreams to fulfill still
Can't complete em with a still kill
Face to face with enemies still grill
Forgive me for the pain I've caused and the sins I've committed
even though I'm not hopin to go
I wish someone would open the do'
This man's holding the trigger and his finger's steady choking it slow
Is this the end?

Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then Is this the end?

Just, can't, let, go Is this the end?
I, just, don't, know
Wish it would've happened then

Did I just hear a tight jam, now it's on let make my maneuver
Hit the alley saw a man in a landcruiser
In his hand was a Ruger, dipped in a Lex like Luger
Heard shots from a steel bruiser
Teflon in the seat took a pale stress
Felt the hate on my chest as I placed on my vest
What's wrong with the brakes in the LX?
Ran straight into a lightpole, just before I got my life stole
A car came to the rescue
I bailed in and said, ""Bless you
But what made me the man you would wanna show help to?""
I proceeded to ask him, and he said with a passion

I could never watch a soul die, plus you the man lookin too fly
But who are you?  The pimp nigga named Twista from the cold Chi
When the sun's shy gotta keep one eye, nigga I been shot at and stole on
No protection from one time, only caught for my prime
So I asked the Father what I did so wrong?
Cause shit it's been hard for me besides chief
and the smell of sweet news when the beef brew
Motherfuckers steady ballin but steady fallin
right in detours, bout to hit my feet soon
So I just presume, deep into the rhymes of a rapper
Prepare my mind for the capture
Thinkin Ginuwine like the bachelor
But why these niggaz wanna make us into crime with the rapture?
Ego for dispersin us, don't even hurt the clutch
Cause he's coldblooded and merciless
Steady bustin shots at both of us, was the strap close to us
Then for survival we both to bust
But Renaults get to roast to crush, cause he steady gettin closer
Paranoid like a crackfiend when the gat seen
scream when the bullet hit me in the shoulder
Don't wanna die til I get older
Try to visualize the beholder, he's inconceivable
so now my sight is gettin dark a lot
Best to step off in this parking lot where them dogs bark a lot
And try to wait until his ma get hot
I can make a person fight to survive whether good or connivin
You never know when it's your time to leave
Smokin weed to keep my mind at ease, let's go back to the car
but wait, I can't find the keys
Plus we didn't chill long enough, the footsteps are comin close
Is it one of them unholy men?
With a strap ready to boldly sin
Mama told me it was comin, but I wish she woulda told me when
Is this the end?

Momma told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older

It's been a while, where should we begin
Feels like forever
Within my heart are memories
Of perfect love that you gave to me

Oh how quickly life can turn around

Something I touch and can feel
I'll hold it close and never let it go
Said why, why do we live life
With all this hate inside
I'll give it away ‘cause I don't want it no more
Please help me find a place
Somewhere far away
Yes, I'll go and you'll never see me again

All this energy to give

I tell it like it is
If the truth will set you free

Can't you hear the ringing ‘cause
for you the bell tolls

I'm looking down now that it's over
Reflecting on all of my mistakes

Been trading love with indifference

Creedence Clearwater Revisited,"As long as I remember
The rain's been comin' down
Clouds of mystery pourin'
Confusion on the ground

Good men through the ages
Tryin' to find the sun
And I wonder, still I wonder
Who'll stop the rain

I went down Virginia
Seekin' shelter from the storm
Caught up in the fable
I watched the tower grow

Five year plans and new deals
Wrapped in golden chains
And I wonder, still I wonder
Who'll stop the rain?

Heard the singers playin'
How we cheered for more
The crowd then rushed together
Tryin' to keep warm

Still the rain kept pourin'
Fallin' on my ears
And I wonder, still I wonder
Who'll stop the rain?

",Who'll Stop the Rain

There's a calm before the storm,
I know; it's been comin' for some time.
When it's over, so they say,
It'll rain a sunny day,
I know; shinin' down like water.

I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain
Comin' down on a sunny day?

Yesterday, and days before,
Sun is cold and rain is hard,
I know; been that way for all my time.
'Til forever, on it goes
Through the circle, fast and slow,
I know; it can't stop, I wonder.

I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain

I set out on the road
Seekin' my fame and fortune
Lookin' for a pot of gold
Thing got bad and things got worse
I guess you know the tune
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again

Rode in on the Greyhound
I'll be walkin' out if I go
I was just passin' through
Must be seven months or more
Ran out of time and money
Looks like they took my friends
Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again

A man from the magazine
Said I was on my way
Somewhere I lost connections
Ran out of songs to play
I came into town, a one night stand
Looks like my plans fell through
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again

If I only had a dollar
For every song I've sung
Every time I had to play
While people sat there drunk
You know, I'd catch the next train
Back to where I live
Oh Lord, stuck in a Lodi again
Oh Lord, I'm stuck in a Lodi again",Lodi

It seemed like a good idea way back then.

Was it something I done, something that she heard?
You know she left me, my baby left me.

But, I stand at my window, wring my hands and cry.
I hate to lose that woman, hate to say goodbye.
You know she left me, I say, she left me.
My baby even left me, never said goodbye.
Help me, boy!

And now, one of these mornings, lord, it won't be long,

You'll look for me and, baby, daddy he'll be gone.
You know she left me, I say she left me.
My baby even left me, never said a word.

Clouds of mystery pouring Confusion on the ground.

Caught up in the fable, I watched the tower grow.
Five year plans and new deals, Wrapped in golden chains.
And I wonder, Still I wonder Who'll stop the rain.

That you better learn it fast, you better learn it young,

Creeper,"Pretty, but he don’t tell you about it
Winter scarves and skirts of velvet
Still drink just like we did in school
I passed your old house down by the cemetery
Club nights and university
When your friends sing ‘Born to Run’, baby, resist, 'cause we were ‘Born to Drift’

If you could see the wreck I am these days
you’d have new reasons to stay away
Just hold my hand for a little while
Misery never goes out of style

I see you sometimes in dreams I have
In your bra in the room you used to rent
Do you ever wish you could wake someone else?
And so I wrote down a list of coroners, their names, their office phone numbers
To pronounce dead the thing we had
In tombs, ex-boyfriends bedrooms

If you could see the wreck I am these days
You’d have new reasons to stay away
Just hold my hand for a little while
Misery never goes out of style

If you could see the wreck I am these days
You’d have new reasons to stay away
Just hold my hand for a little while

I’m your chipped nail paint 
I’m the fabric of your coat
You are all I fear 
You are words I never wrote
I’m your chipped nail paint 
I’m the fabric of your coat
You are all I fear 
You are words I never wrote
You are years ago

Creeper,"Baby, I'm sorry to call you so late
Oh, I forget I can't call you that name
Still make those slips all of the time
Don't know when I'll get better
I think to the night that you handed me back
The records we shared and the life that we had
You said in that condescending tone
""I'll never forget you""

She's in your jeans, but I don't care
You were my dream, now my nightmare

At your sister's wedding I gave all that I had
Your father was cold and your mother was sad
I thought to myself they were like you and I when we last met
My love is a nail I can't pull out with pliers
The lovers I've had have been gaslighting liars
Don't know what that says about me, but I just give in
I mean it now, it's making me ill

She's in your jeans, but I don't care
You were my dream, now my nightmare

So call me when you break up as you always do
Can't promise I will pick up
I'm done with you

Sadly not far enough for you to stay off my mind
I took out an ad in the ""lonely hearts"" section
It read ""Don't come back""

But baby, now we know the world is ending
And there's no point in us pretending not to want to disappear
Some days I lace my coffee with poison just to feel the hit
And I've been cheating death for years

So you're leaving, I ain't grieving
'Cause darling, we all die alone
You're sick of me now
And I can't blame you
I'm sick of myself too

Remember when we sat on bumper cars at 3 a.m. in warm weather?
Broken apart, but I thought we'd be better broken together

But baby, now we know the world is ending
And there's no point in us pretending not to want to disappear

You're sick of me now
And I can't blame you

You know everything about me
So I'm still praying for a comet to wipe out everything I promised you

So you're leaving, I ain't grieving
'Cause darling, we all die alone
You're sick of me now
And I can't blame you
I'm sick of myself too

But life don't seem as dark when I sing with you, with you

Old enough to fall apart

We were burning down houses singing ""love has left us low""
You swim the water now even though you know exactly what lies below
Calling ""wolf"" each time you say you'll go

Eternity, in your arms

Wrap your heart in chain mail
We all die just to feel alive
Your friends become echoes of a life that you left behind

Floating like an astronaut in space
They tell me that purgatory's such a pretty place
But I never thought about living here
Heaven knows hell's gates are near
Forever seems like such a thing to waste

Running from this world's demands
All those radio bands never made me feel

And in your diary you had an entry listing all your enemies, 
What you'd do to them and what you'd do it for

All those radio bands never made me feel

Can music save your mortal soul? 
Can you teach me how to dance real slow?""

And in your hospital room at the midnight hour,
You had your boyfriend back just for half an hour
Past the landscaped shrubs and the rusted iron gate

So let's start a siege, you make a list of demands
Set the hostages free and we'll die holding hands

And it's bed time for the troubled sea

An they asked me if anyone who cares
Would join them for lunch with brandied pears
Bring Tracy we have her missing tears
Chasing Tracy is all I do Tracy's rotten

All the way through captain killjoy
Said that it was true two lovers lost
And searching for sat naked on the casino floor
Be brave boy show your broken wings but don't
Listen it hurts when Tracy sings

Chasing Tracy is all I do Tracy's rotten
All the way through captain killjoy
Said that it was true don't know what to do
Well I waited beneath the giving tree

And wondered if it would set me free rest
Gentle beneath the emerald sea there's Tracy
Cool hands of mercury chasing

I'm not as down as you

To walk around these days

There was a man unkown
Stripped himself down to the bone
And he said
Hey, give me nothing, I'm from nowhere
And you don't know my name

Chance of a lifetime
Romance and white wine

And there's not a bone in my body that's good
I watch the tanks roll by
Disguising themselves as the ambulance
Who will race to the show
Waving flowers and caskets, oh no
It's just another win for hope and a heart made of tin
If I were alive I would slow dance in the ghetto
And sleep beneath the street
Doesn't exist
Guess I just missed
Chance of a lifetime
Christmas and sweet pine
Easy living
A new beginning

Left all alone
Watching breakups and afternoon drama
I must have lost my mind
She was trapped on the bus
With a kiss in her hand
And when the screams died down
Her lips were on fire
Spitting magic around
There was one more mile
It was long it was long
I would float on the thermals of laughter
High where I belong
It doesn't exist
Guess I just missed
Chance of a lifetime
Lemonade and sunshine
Easy living
It's just beginning

Stole my saxophone
Stripped me to skin and bone

Red and cruel
Ask myself can i fight this

Telling me jokes again
Nineteen he was handsome
A ray farmer spreading sun on the roofs of man
Moon queen she was sexual
Silver hands to hold
Bouquet of marigold
Sad to love her

Nothing he had could touch her
Frail arms reaching for the star
Sparkling jewel

Blinds me she's hysterical

Delia had
Hot pink fingernails
Grey armour bright red shoes
And a violin
Take care

Loves her alcohol
Hates me when i don't call

Whirling around 'till I drop

My mind is in a whirlpool 
Give me a little hope 
One small thing to cling to

You got me going in circles 
Oh, around and around I go 
You got me going in circles 
Oh, around and around I go 

First you go and tell me this 
Then you go and doin that 
Its mixed signals in my head 
You never give me straight facts 
Comin' at me with these stories 
Taken up a playa time 
You seemed confused up in yo head 
And you can not make up your mind 
I'd be the first one to listnin'
But I think its disrespect 
Lyin' through yo teeth talkin' out the side of yo neck 
Got me goin' round and round 
Make a playa wanna hurt ya 
Thinkin' that you was straight up 
Got me goin' in a circle 

Ay, my head is constantly spinnin' twistin' 
'cause Nadas was trippin' on me 
First time for ya lovy dubbi 
And now he call me his homie 
Wishy washy kinda feelin 
Tryna play wit my emotions 
And mumbled the words I love you 
Went then said that he was jokin'
Stuffed up in the mind 
Tough love is what he calls it 
I don't read between the lines 
Now you need to get the talkin'
Spell it out and make it clear 
Don't tell me what I wanna hear 
Yes or no jus' goin' and say it 
'cause inside I'm goin' crazy

[Chorus] 

I'm strung out over you (you, ova you)

Yes it relaxes me, satisfactory, 
Treat me like a queen 
It was love at first sight on that night 
Once I stepped on the scene 
Now my body once I got it 
Fulfillin' all my needs 
He had my feenin', obscenein' not meanin'
Jus' smellin' his grease 
I really want him, yes I want him 
But the law disagrees 
Our loves illegal certain people

Ay since we came on the scene we been hated on mostly
Niggas talk shit but they watch real closely
Ay put that thang on that nigga tell that nigga you don't know
Bitch nigga you don't know me nigga you don't know me

Now its a bunch of niggas hatin on the mob since we came on
Niggas talkin shit cause they broke and they ain't on
Who them niggas rappin they ain't snappin on that lame song
Tell them muthafuckas that them suckas got the game wrong
You seen us on MTV and our album on the shelf
4-5 hundred strong and we ain't need no fuckin help
Fuck a hype man we can crank the show up by ourself
And play them hatin ass muthaufuckas to the left

I ride in the back wit lil buss niggas 
All of em back wit em black wit em black pumps wit them black slacks and black macs
And all of em gutta thoreau with that gangsta
Nigga we blow perk we don't blow reggie with them wankstas
I'm trapped out on the curb and errbody in my squad 
You know we keep that expensive ass herb
For all these fuck niggas who plottin and hatin on me
Ha ha you already slow I keep a K on me

[Chorus: 2x]

Since we came up on scene we been hated on contemplated on
But that shit don't even phase me homes (phase me homes)
Niggas smile up in yo face and turn around and turn around and steady hatin
We one of the reasons that yo song is in heavy rotation
Who can say they made a classic hit that gets the club jumpin
Started in 2001 4 years passed and today its still bumpin
Always on the fuckin grind niggas tryna stop our shine
You'll never get the best of us cause we too tough and we gon ride

We gon ride and leave you counterfits behind playa but this click gon shine
You hatin cause I got mines but its all good that's just you
L12's get the L in they face 
Flaw niggas get no props they get put in they place everyday
That's just how it is that's just how it goes
So I stay up on my toes and chose my money over hoes
Mobbin over esub dammit ay lil stupid bitch
MOB that be the click and you don't really know about me

[Chorus: 2x]

You know we stars now in them duece dueces
Hand out the brain nigga throw them dueces
Or I might throw it back I'm in the bichevy 
Niggas hatin on me because my pockets heavy
Dreads in my head I got my mind right
My next day say I'm 30 so the time right
I do alotta flexin yeah I be puttin on
I guess that's that's the reason why you boys be hatin on
I'm known to get it on rain sleet or snow
I sack em fat they start runnin off like some hoes
Niggas hatin cause they bitches jumpin out they clothes
Suckin him and suckin me the greatest nigga yeen know

And keep my eyes on them boys jumpin' out them black vans

I'm a man, get it right, 'cause I ain't playin'
Six shots out the roof, it'll make you feel what I'm sayin'
And these hoes be on my nob, like a motherfuckn' hand
Every fight, the Mariot, she let me beat it like a band

I never had to rob, I never had a job
They wouldn't hire me 'cause I was lookin' like a slob
At school I was a fool, my grades was off the wall
Was failin' every class so they wouldn't let me play no ball

I started makin' beats,then hooked up with these thugs
Been grindin' everyday while steamin' away from sellin' drugs
Didn't have to steal no dubs or leave um' wit no pocket lint

Stay on the grind all the time, gotta get mine, I'm a hustler
I stay away from the haters and the busters

Naw, I ain't fake, I don't talk 'cause I don't trust you
Never gotta sell rocks just to get dough
I do my shit the right way just so I can get mo'
'Cause if you don't you gon' use it as a question
And try to bust a nigga's head everytime the money get low

You already know money is my mind frame
Nigga's jackin mine, they ain't got no type of mind games
'Cause Ellenwood is where I hang
Do my shit myself, got my own rules and my ways
I got a aura about myself and that's greatness

Never settle for the less, stop all the hater shit
Don't get offended 'cause I'm gettin' mine to make it
And I'm tryin' always, can't nobody come and take this

Money makin' my everyday mission, I slippin' if I don't flip
All you suckers, you listen this pimpin'
Keep these bitches whipped straight from the bottom now
Ballin', ridin' high with my niggas, never could I be a lame

'Cause them lame's don't count figures, they roll nickel's
And they definitely love to hate and I shine in their face
While they throw they life away
I'ma keep on countin' cake
Keep that yip yap to yourself

Ain't no shame 'cause I need a nigga with a job
I'ma grind through the heat or the sleet or the snow stayin' up on my top, baby
Even through the fall standin' tall, never settle for less so I'm the best

Never second guessin' 'cause your girl want it all down the hustle
Just to get it off the muscle, if I have to I'ma struggle
'Cause I am down for my nigga's crime mob
Never better for deez streets for the heat

You better practice what you preach

Can't stop, won't stop, nigga, that's that Crip Hop
Roll until I hit the top, find a bitch to break my crop
Hit a switch and then a drop, if it's a club then she gon' hop
From club to club and dick to dick, trick bitch, hush the shit
Hit licks for big chips, get rich, retire quick
Spit shit for convicts and hoes that's full of nonsense
Fuck a guilty conscience, I kill shit regardless
It's real shit, the hardest, the realest regardless
Don't ever try to get shit started, that's retarded
You ain't gotta ask how we got in, we bogarted
y'all gon' know how we lay shit down, it ain't no secret
And it's gon' stay in the fam, nigga, that's how we gon' keep it
It ain't no time for jokin, nigga, fuck the Dreamcast
Busters be mad, see well on a misssion that means cash
You better soak up some game and learn to be a rich roller
Shots hit you through your window while you was holdin your controller
Now it's over

[ CHORUS: Joi Patrice ]
All my life I played this game
And my life is full of pain
I don't know if I'll ever change
Perkin on drink and smokin Mary Jane

[ VERSE 2: Spice 1 ]
My life is full of sin, too much drama in California
Niggas runnin up on ya to dump and put you in a coma
Or worse, six feet, get put as deep as you stand
Get carried by five homies, your brother the sixth man
Think about your life and what you got to live for
You may not have a lot of money but you still find a way to glow
Just keep pushin and strivin, livin one day at a time
Have patience with life and one day your light'll shine
And when you shine, watch them niggas that watch you gleam
Cause envy brings niggas to jack for bling-bling
In my life it's hard to deal with the pain
But it's part of bein a man, it's part of the game
Accept the shit and move on, partner, and hope for the best
Cause the best way to get some revenge is through success
Cause they don't like to see you come from nothin to somethin
Single in rotation on the radio bumpin

[ CHORUS: Joi Patrice ]

[ VERSE 3: Celly Cel ]
When I really think about it, life is fucked up
All the shit I did and man, I'm still here, I lucked up
I know it's people prayin for my soul every day
Before I go to bed I get down on my knees and pray
Niggas like me ain't gon' never be shit
If you can't shoot a basketball or grab the mic and make a hit
We set up to fail before we get a opportunity
It's easy access to drugs in the black community
So we choose it, we sell it and we use it
We like to live our life fast and know we might even lose it
Abuse it, with 40oz. Mad Dog and hard liquor
Have you catchin cases, makin a nigga walk the yard quicker
It ain't no love, mayne, mama didn't raise a thug
But I got caught up in the streets, I like to taste the blood
I like drug money, 211 thug money
I ran the streets fascinated by that blood money

Crimpshrine,"You left sometime ago, and now I just don't know.
Bur for right now, I know there ain't no way
And it seems to me that you seem to be 
A million miles away.
What can I do? I need to be with you
There's so much I've been meanin' to say
And I can't see why we have to be
A million miles away.
I had a dream last night, everything seemed alright
You weren't so far away
Sunshine in your eyes, makes me wonder why
I have to wake up alone another day.
And this lonliness just makes me feel depressed
But thoughts of a smilin' face
Assures me that there is someplace
That I can run to, that I can be with you
I can see it in my mind
So it's back up to Mendo one more time.
And I'll be back in the summertime
With a handfull of flowers and a bottle of cheap wine.
In the summer time.
And I know just where to find you at
And when I do I ain't comin' back, no
So long as you're by my side.",Summertime

Inspiration
And the thought of a hundred million smiles
And a hundred million buildings burning to the ground
From a hundred million miles away, I can hear the sound
Of a hundred million burning definitions
And a hundred million dead restrictions
And a hundred million minds set free
From the chains put there a generation before
I can see the world falling to it's knees
Screaming please someone help me

Now I can see, we've destroyed ourselves with certainty
And this machine will crumble and fade
To a hundred million miles away
Where there's someone just like me

Thinking everything will be OK
From a hundred million miles I can see a man
And I know he understands
Saying your chains are your own
It's your mirror, so smash it.",Inspiration

Now I had this lil' homie that I thought was real
Had flows in his game and I'll never forget him
Used to be down for the hood thang
Quick to cook and breakin' cane
Straight runnin' thangs around the way
Havin' his money man
A rider from the hood understood by many sets
With the hood tatted on his back arm and neck
Givin a fuck about a robbery steady dippin and ready for trippin
Let the good times roll when my nigga put that clip in
The type of homie you can depend on
When some shit got crazy or relict went dead wrong
Respected by G's, lil' locs and ghetto queens
Stripes from late night creepin' with infra-red beams
He seemed to be a soldier who thought he would switch
And start talkin like a lil' old punk bitch
When the Feds got on him
He ran his mouth like a two dollar hoe
Even brought that motherfucker to my door

Betrayed, can't trust nobody cause people nowadays act crazy
Betrayed, can't trust nobody cause people nowadays act shady

Now I had this fly bitch that was on my team
Big tits, brown ass fallin' out them jeans
Used to be down to suck a fat dick
Quick to turn a bitch trick
Brang the scrilla home to me
Kept my pockets fat
Should've stopped me on the block sellin' coochie for big leaf
With the cold dippin' the pocket while she on her knees
Givin a fuck about a murder, give her a strap watch it now
Breakin' a nigga a bid
When it comes down to the snaps
That type of hoe you can rely on
When the chips get low
This hoe gon' get a grand O
Laced on the team I guess that's why she call me daddy
Never thought this funky bitch will run her twist and try to have it
For the ki's I got this hoe tried to set me up
And the folks out side waitin' to tie a nigga up
But I'm sure I do this funky hoe was up to something
So I grabbed the .9 and started dumpin'

Now I got this crazy uncle kept a badass hoe
Runnin games, havin' thangs, steady stackin' the dough
Used to be down for the hoo ride, quick to do a homicide
If you owed him chips you better pay him or you for sure to die
Soldier from that old school, ready for combat
With a left hook down to put a youngster on his back
Really not care where you come from, what set you claim
See it's all about that scrilla, when the .9 take game (that's right)
That type of uncle you respected
Hit a lick for the chips, bump a bitch and get naked
He used to lounge in my house when the things got crazy
Never thought he'd crossed the line and be fuckin my lady
But it goes for sure then my uncle was a cold nigga
Played to find a weakness in my bitch and he went up in her
Hit the stash, get some cash and a quarter key
Want to kill his ass but I can't smoke my own family

Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head",You Go to My Head

Hey man, I've learned my lesson
Got a good girl, count your blessings
Instead of spending them up on sex
And good girls don't grow on trees
(B.I.G) I was out in the world just messin'
With the bad girls, getting refreshed and
Got a call from my girl
Just left saying good girls don't grow on trees

I felt like it was yesterday,
The times we had that went away
We're still young, but of course we felt a lot
Now I've been living like a villainess been shot
I met her through a friend of mine,
Who told me that this girl was fine.
I picked her up and I started to figure out
There's more on the inside than on the out

(What she say? what she say?)
She said don't bother me (hey hey)
She told me that I had to leave
I wanted her just to believe

Hey man, I've learned my lesson
Got a good girl, count your blessings
Instead of spending them up on sex
And good girls don't grow on trees
I was out in the world just messin'
With the bad girls, getting refreshed and
Got a call from my girl
Just left, good girls don't grow on trees

Helped me get my world in tact
She had my heart, I told her that
Now it hurts every time I think about
The very night that I started with acting out
The morning brought a painful sun
Knowing now just what I've done
She always was the better half for sure
The part of me in life that I preferred

I gave up all of me (hey hey)
Though I tore her up inside
We still kept the love alive (Amen!)

Hey man, I've learned my lesson
Got a good girl, count your blessings

Woah, she's like a diamond out the rough
You know the good girls tainted by the bad world
The good girls hard to find
Woah, she's like H2O, can't get enough

Y quien soy yo para verte

Sube, sube y mira lo que veo yo
Sube y mira lo cerca que esta el cielo
Yo te lo debo

Mi son mi canción con cada latido del corazón
Esta va por ti

Y saca tus penas, abre la ventana
Y mira como brilla hoy el sol

Outside I can hear this dying world screaming. 
Displaced from my earthly home, like the corpse from the tomb.

Turn red in the fall
To brown and to yellow
They fade

And then they have to die
Trapped within the circle time

Visions of shadows that shine
Till one day I returned
And found they were the victims

Luchando por vivir en este espacio cúbico,
Entre la tele el compact y el frigorífico,
Sacarte de mi vida fue realmente estúpido,
Como si el corazón fuera un tubo dentífrico

No creo que haya un complejo vitamínico,
Para sacarme de este grave estado anímico,
Pues siento como sé que siento en esta buscada,
Perdido en tu recuerdo siempre tan esdrújula

Sintiéndome gris,
Amándote ahora, pensando en ti, otra noche así,
Mientras que en el techo se aman los gatos yo sigo aquí,
Yo sigo aquí

Yo sigo aquí,
Pensando en el nuestro con rigor científico,
Para evitar tomarlo como algo trágico,
Porque por dentro soy tan sólo un fanático,
Que quiere que regreses y que está nostálgico

Mientras que en el techo se aman los gatos yo sigo aquí,

Y así detenerlo con el pensamiento
Es como tallar una obra de arte
Que no puedes crear sin enamorarte
Es como abrazar las nubes más bellas

Con mantos de estrellas 
Es como beber las luces del día
Cargando la sed de mis fantasías

Amarte a ti es soñar despierto
Los ojos abiertos
Amarte así es de verdad,
El corazón entregar,
Tan lleno de paz

Es como escribir la última historia
Gritando pasión en vez de victoria
Es como curar aquellas heridas
Es como empezar una nueva vida
