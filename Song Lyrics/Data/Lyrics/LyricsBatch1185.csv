Steppenwolf,"Humanity grew weary
Of it's doubtful state of mind
So it summoned from far and near
All the wise men thought to be sincere
To heal it's wounds and make it whole
And lead the way back to the soul

The charlatans they stayed behind
To count their bags of gold
And some stayed away as if to say
I know that my way's the only way
Afraid to learn they may be wrong
They preach their nothingness at home

But the wise men came together with the hope to free mankind
Of the rubbish that had gathered in god's name
To embrace and trust each other in the search for the supreme
And they found that all their teachings were the same

And when at last the word went round
That all were one and all
Many returned to seek the light
Nobody claimed that he was right
It's sad to know it's just a song
To dream and hope still can't be wrong 

Repeat chorus",Spiritual Fantasy
Steppenwolf,"You comin' here
Tellin' me how proud you are
Some clown just handed you
A shiny little silver star
You say, over there, the men are brave
While the chickens stay away
Cause they're all too much afraid
To fight for somethin' they should believe in
I'm sorry friend, you've got it backwards

They won't follow when your whistle blows
Won't come runnin' when your rooster crows
Don't eat the same old crow until their minds have gone 
They don't fear the squawk of the little silly chicken hawk
Uh, uh huh, help us clean our own backyard
Before you go to preach abroad
Believe me it won't be easy

As you well know, not every bird can roam the sky
I see your wings, man, but can you fly?
All I see when I look down, something jumpin' on the ground scratchin' dirt
Cluckin' in the barnyard, tell me, could that be you?
In that case, lay another egg
Try to save yourself from the bar-be-cue",Chicken Wolf
Steppenwolf,"Don't cry, it's gonna be alright.
I'm goin' to listen to what you have to say tonight
Oh my, did you do something wrong? 
You got messed up while sitting on the throne

Dear ladies won't you turn a new page
We saw your daughter's burning the stag

Look up, turn your head around
Then take a look beside you on the ground
Yes mam', I saw the old man
Sleeping off his trip beside two stimulation cans

Dear ladies won't you turn a new page
We saw your daughter's burning the stage",Don't Cry
Steppenwolf,"What drives a man to do all that he can
Brings people down to what he call his own
Believes in himself but nobody else
Does he trust and try to understand
How they feel, can he see?

Not so good

He's a God fearing man
Yes, he does all that he can
To try and understand
What's wrong with his fellow men?

What's wrong, what's wrong?

He looks at me, what does he see?
Blood, flesh and bones and my rib
Love is gone and hate has come
But don't blame yourself
If you can't find somebody else

He's a God fearing man
Yes, he does all that he can

Steppenwolf,"One another, love each other, friendliness is kind
Specially when you're a friend of mine
Come together at the same time

I'm goin' upstairs, and bring down all of my clothes
Where I go baby, you will never know

My mother dead and gone, my father don't want me around
My mother dead and gone, my father don't want me around
Don't you know baby, I ain't got no place to go

Steppenwolf,"What can you see with your ear on the ground
Try to lift up your feet, girl, and take a look around
Let me see your eyes girl
We've got to make them big
If you'd like to see the truth
I'd better tighten up your wig

Your mind is too narrow, and it's no surprise 
If you fell on a pin, well, you'd be blind in both eyes
Oh, let me see your head, girl, we've got to make it big
Until your ears come apart,
I better tighten up your wig

Watch out for the lunch bunch, they'll try bring you down
Don't get hung up in the shower, baby, you might drown
Oh yeah, oh, your head looks kinda big
Before I loose you mind, girl,
I better tighten up your wig

Just before we go, I'd like to mention Junior Wells
We stole his thing from him, and he from someone else
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, he plays the blues like few before
May he play forevermore",Tighten up Your Wig

Steppenwolf,"You've filled this house with things of gold
While handing crumbs to the old and poor
And then you preach about being pure
And wonder why we're laughing
In your old way you're trying to find us
But we can't follow what's behind us
Too much blind faith, it will blind us
Though sometimes it's a blessing

But I remember when I still embraced you
A lttle prayer would ease my mind
'Til I saw that you hide from the misery outside so I left you behind
But all the other teachings
That I've tried were 'bout the same
One grain of truth mixed with confusion caused by man
But since you're around anyway
May as well get you back on your feet again
Get right back up on your feet
Don't ya know we need somebody to 
Do some work down in the street
You might just touch somebody
Start to think about today
Throw your robe and staff away
And break away from yesteray
Ah, tell me can we reach you
I don't know, still we got to go
From here to there eventually

While others die up against the wall
You take the time to tell us all
'Bout how we're not supposed to ball
You really are a riot
It's got nothin' to do with heaven or hell
What I do in bed, I'm not gonna tell
What I'm talking about you know damn well
You really ought to try it

Repeat chorus:",From Here to There Eventually
Steppenwolf,"Starin' at the boob tube, turnin' on the big knob
Tryin' to find some life in the waste land
Fin'ly found a program, gonna deal with Mary Jane
Ready for a trip into hate land
Obnoxious Joe comes on the screen
Along with his guest self-righteous Sam
And one more guy who doesn't count
His hair and clothes are too far out

While pushin' back his glasses Sam is sayin' casually
""I was elected by the masses""
And with that in mind he starts to unwind
A vicious attack on the finest of grasses

Well it's evil, wicked, mean and nasty
(Don't step on the grass, Sam)
And it will ruin our fair country
(Don't be such an ass, Sam)
Well, it will hook your Sue and Johnny
(You're so full of bull, Sam)
All will pay that disagree with me
(Please give up you already lost the fight, alright)

Misinformation Sam and Joe
Are feeding to the nation
But the one who didn't count counted them out
By exposing all their false quotations
Faced by a very awkward situation
This is all he'd say to save the day

Well it's evil, wicked, mean and nasty
(Don't step on the grass, Sam)
And it will ruin our fair country
(Don't be such an ass, Sam)
Well, it will hook your Sue and Johnny
(You're so full of bull, Sam)
All will pay that disagree with me
(Please give up you already lost the fight alright)

You waste my coin Sam, all you can
To jail my fellow man
For smoking all the noble weed
You need much more than him
You've been telling lies so long
Some believe they're true
So they close their eyes to things
You have no right to do
Just as soon as you are gone
Hope will start to climb
Please don't stay around too long
You're wasting precious time","Don't Step on the Grass, Sam"
Steppenwolf,"He was talkin' 'bout the army while he passed his pipe around
An American deserter who found peace on Swedish ground
He had joined to seek adventure and to prove himself a man
But they tried to crush his spirit 'til his conscience ruined their plans
And he thought of those who suffer for the sake of honesty
All those who refuse to follow traitors to humanity

Here's to all the draft resisters who will fight for sanity
When they march them off to prison in this land of libety

Heed the threat and awesome power of the mighty Pentagon
Which is wasting precious millions on the toys of Washington

Don't forget the Draft Resister and their silent, lonely plea
When they march them off to prison, they will go for you and me.

Shame, disgrace and all dishonor, wrongly placed upon their heads
Will not rob them of the courage which betrays the innocent",Draft Resister
Steppenwolf,"What gives you the right  hey you
To stand there and tell me what to do
Tell me who gave you the power
To stop me from livin' like I do

Remember if you plan to stay
Those who give can take away.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you

Just one time I'd like to be somewhere where
None of your clever lies fill the air
I'm tired of your frozen smile and voice of tin
Just might all gang up on you
Turn the knob and do you in

Remember if you plan to stay
Those who give can take away.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you

This never ending power play
'Tween Jealousy, greed and vicious hate
Is grinding us like giant millstones
But it can't be our only fate
It's time we got our heads together
And let 'em know that we're awake

Those in the dark, you know they're no longer blind
They're breakin' from your strangle hold on their minds
Those who can see don't need no one to cross the street
Be careful who you're pushin' round
They just might find you obsolete

Remember if you plan to stay
Those who give can take away.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you",Power Play
Steppenwolf,"Drop down Mama let your boss man see
If you can howl just like a dog for me
Black leather is my favorite game
And you will learn how to scream my name

Look here girl, rest your gums
I'm gonna do like your daddy done
Now let me see you Baby, rockin' soft and slow
Hey! If you don't believe I'll follow you down girl
You've got to go
Don't ya squeeze me Baby, or you will earn your stripes
And you better not be a ball crusher
If you don't know how to pay the price

Now if you really want to taste a joy supreme
You should stay and meet the team
The vulture and his plastic straw
Make you want to dance and shout for more
Come on Baby let me show you 'round the room
And give you time to holler
Any time you can sling it around
We can surely raise a dollar",Ball Crusher

Steppenwolf,"Forty days and forty nights
Since my baby done left this town
Oh the sun shinin' all day long
But the rain it just keeps on comin' down
She's my life I need her so
Why she left I just don't know

Forty days and forty nights
Since I sat right down and cried
It keeps on rainin' all the time
But the river is runnin' dry
Lord help me it just ain't right
I love that girl with all my might

Forty days and forty nights
Since my baby done broke my heart
I've been searchin' for her everywhere
Just like a blind man in the dark
Love can make a poor man rich
Or break his heart, I don't know which

Forty days and forty nights
Like a ship out on the stormy sea

That she would come back home to me

I must admit she seemed kinda tipsy at the time 
The more she drank the more 
She seemed to be pickin' up my vibe 
And by the end of the night 
I got them digits down in my phone (down in my phone) 

We met again 
This time at club 
She wouldn't stop puttin' down shots of crown 
She was all lickin' up on me 
Like there wasn't anybody else around 
And when I left she texted me 
That I should have taken her home 
(should have taken her home) 

We started hanging 
She wasn't drinkin' 
She wasn't payin' 
Me any attention 
No conversatin'
No escalatin'

What we was doin so I figured out 
She only likes me when shes drunk 
Why don't I give it up 
Don't get a word unless the girls gettin' gone 
Don't wanna get her drunk 
Just to get love 

When she drinks shes only leadin' me on 
Another week went by and then I get another invite 
To kick it at a place alone so I responded alright 
Another chance with a girl of my dreams 

Yeah shes a ten (yeah shes a ten) 
So I show up at nine but an hour after I said I would 
The way she actin' seems like this girl really like me good 
But then I see she brought 
A bottle down its happenin' again (happenin' again) 

Another time hangin'
How much she be drinkin'
Girl I ain't playin' 
No more delayin' 
I go to ask her 
About this disaster

You know its only gonna throw my game off track 
No a drink in her hand 
Wont get a man 
Wont even ask her what your sayin'
I tried to get a hug and 
I had to fill my mug and 
She wanna get it it on a 
Only with corona 

If I give her white wine

Sterling Davis and His Orchestra,"Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song
Sterling Davis and His Orchestra,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You
Sterling Davis and His Orchestra,"If they ask me, I could write a book
About the way you walk and whisper and look
I could write a preface on how we met
So the world would never forget

And the simple secret of the plot
Is just to tell them that I love you, a lot
Then the world discovers as my book ends
How to make two lovers of friends

If they ask me, I could write a book

Sterling Davis and His Orchestra,"It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Dear one, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you

It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue

Sterling Davis and His Orchestra,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Sterling Price-McKinney,"Life without a romance is a life that's sad
 I've never had a love of my own
 Every day is just another day to me
 Why must I be alone

 Chasing shadows
 Chasing love dreams in vain
 While my heart keeps on singing 
 Just a lonely refrain

 Chasing shadows
 All is cloudy above
 Like a shadow I'm drifting, 
 Hoping I'll find my love, find my love

 Who knows some day someone may come along
 And change my lonely song to happiness
 Unitl the darkness fades into the dawn
 I'll just go on, I guess

 Chasing shadows, 
 Just a dreamer am I
 Hoping I'll find a rainbow 
 When the shadows roll by

 Walking 'round in circles. don't know where I am 
 Or who I am, My mind's in a daze
 Nothing happens just another day is gone
 Must I go on always",Chasing Shadows
Sterling Silver,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You

I promise that I won't be wasting your time

I'm making a point and I'm tryin' to draw the line
And if I'm wrong then hell it might be blind

Pieces missing out ya puzzle
Notch up your mind
And everywhere I turn I keep seeing signs like
(Oh) y'all look good together
(Oh) looking like sister and brother
(Oh) y'all act just like each other play it off like man whatever
And now I'm thinking about

[Chorus]

I'm going hard till I get her
Cause my mission won't be complete till I'm with her.
Even though right now she acting kinda bitter
But I'm thinking in a minute she will reconsider
Especially if she understands how I dig her
Yea I think big but I plan even bigger
Walking in the sands holding hands by the river
Good love make her legs shake then she shiver
Being all that she needs is my soul purpose.
If she don't feel the same way though it's all worthless
Everybody makes mistakes so we ain't perfect
It's not cause I want this to happen I deserve it
Peeped your whole style out and I observe it
I see you ain't making this easy I gotta earn it
But I gotta make this official tho I can't be the man I wanna be till I'm with you though.

Can a thug let you know whats going on
In my mind girl this wont be long
It something so mysterious about ya
That's why I want to keep you round and everything about ya
You look like you were made yesterday
I see me waking up to you everyday
But girl I'm only human
Now I'm weighing options

I Remember being single
Girls gone wild steering wheel high
I remember being single
Eyes low on the down-low riding slow-mo
I remember being single
Going where I wanna go
Ain't nothing like doing me
I remember being single
I remember being single

Now I gotta
I gotta get myself together I'm tripping
But you should of seen the way I was living
Chicks in skirts in every area code
I was wilin' outta control
Girl you just don't know
I know your perfect for me
So excuse me reminiscing
But girl I'm only human
So I'm weighing options
I was getting my grown man on doing what I wanna
Catch me in the club just sipping a corona
If I seen a dime bets believe I gotta bone her
I remember them days

Want you to know, what you want us to know

To pimp ya hand slips, I'm set to rip tits

You niggas should leave, well who's that?
    ""Frukwan!""
I got style and physique, see
Prince Paul, what, what, we know that you got guts
Let 'em know what's up wit the scratch and cut

    (Prince Paul scratches it up)

[Daddy-O]
You got on and on and three steps ahead
Hot butter on, say what, the cornbread
Stet start troopin' wit the rhymes galore
You do the patty duke, til you can't no more
Play after dark, and search to come in
You might bump heads wit some of ya friends
And the D.J., he may blow ya mind
D.J. Prince Paul, is one of a kind

[Delite]
With a little pat, we smack and then shalat
To a monk that hates, spit out the fact
That the crew is not a threat to society
But opportunity to make people feel hot beats
So we deliver the fun, take her way down un'
Make people gather round and shake their bun
And we never leave a jam til the job is done
And if you want to fight that, we could go for some

[Frukwan]
Right to left, you right, he's deaf
Fly girls in the corner, you shootin' ya best
So watch rock the show, so she says no
'cause she see the Prince Paul, cut sparks'll flow
When these cuts are made, it go inside wit the fade
After that's done, that's when we get paid
It's Stet prefect, Prince Paul is direct
And he cut's the old school and that's hi-tech

    (instrumentation)

[Daddy-O]
Dip-dip-dive, so-socialize
I didn't teach to throw ya, threw some exercise
We did the push-up, the sit-up, the jumping jacks
And when we went through, we went around the tracks
But when you smoke that crack, you run like a snail
I didn't teach a poet that we goin' to fail
But when the test came, you know we passed
'cause we the best M.C.'s in the whole gym class

[Frukwan]
Up and down and all around
Now bust the rhythm of the Stetsa sound
Bring if you feel you wants to get snotty
Take a good look at the size of the party
It's six on the mix and Human Percus'
D.B.C. on the keys and the three will discuss, us
'cause we're the must and the cuts we trust
Grand Wizard Prince Paul is ya vitamin plus

[Delite]
We go back and forth, and forth and back
Wit the rhyme on time, we cuttin' on slack
Wit the chance to advance, and hand yo dash
Wit the rhythm that's flown from U.S. to France
We got the D.B.C. to devastate the keys
And the light skinned brother on the mix machine
It's not a funk machine that cause a heart attack
But the mighty Prince Paul on the old 8-track
It's like that ya'll, as personality wins

[ Daddy-O ]
Well here's a little story with an added surprise
About what took place with me and Wise
Went walkin one morning with our new suits on
Wise in his Adidas, me and my (Benetton)
Coolin out drinkin stout, talkin 'bout the world
When we were suddenly stopped by a beautiful girl
She was gorgeous, she told us that her name was Faye
She would like to get busy for the rest of the day
""Well of course,"" we replied, ""but whose date will you be?""
She said, ""(1) or (2), it makes no difference to me""
Whoa, we was with it, had a freak, we could tell
Dialed the first seven digits to the best hotel
In town, rented a room and not a sec too soon
Ordered delicious lunch, about half past noon
After stuffin our face, well, Faye wanted a drink
We ordered up the strongest drink that we could think
After she got a little tipsy I gave Wise the look
Cause we could (smell Faye's tunafish startin to cook)
She started pantin, and breathin, and lickin her lips
And then the next thing you know she was rubbin our hips
Freakin Wise on the bed, freakin me in the corner
I said, ""Why Faye, why?"" she said (""cause I want to"")
Man, it went on for I don't know how long
I thought that I knew strength, but that girl was strong
And how I knew her sexy lovin wouldn't steer me wrong?
When she kissed me on the chest, she kissed me on the neck
She kissed me on the cheek and sang this song
She said:
[ *starts to sing* ] 
""Higher than the highest mountain
And deeper than the deepest sea
That's how I will love you
So darlin, endlessly..""
Break it down, Wise
She said:
""If you think I'm (sexy)""
Say little boy, reach out and (touch me)
If you really need me 
Say little boy, reach out and tell me
And gimme your lovin, gimme your lovin
Don't forget about the all-night squeezin
And don't forget about the huggin and teasin""
- overall it was a good afternoon
(Man, I hope that me and you get to see Faye soon)
You know it, I got some more juice to release

The real, the right dynamite is in the atmosphere
As there's a time and place for everything that's under the sun
This is the time and the place that we have some fun
Now take a see to check the pedigree
of the band that's spelled S-T-E-T
The rhymerator, Dee-Lite, the are-O-D
And on the keys, my brother D-P-see
Wise, Frukwan and my DJ Paul
We puttin competition back, up against the back of the wall

Good lokkin out, we thank ya very much a

Fight to the end, I bet we'll bust ya up
And ya welcome to a force that creeps
Slowly but surely, enough we'll defeat you, BREAK.....

Break: (*scratchin*)

Straight to the letter witta hip-hop band
of America, London and even Japan
And you surely will admit by bein a fan
Nobody else does it like we can
To battle us is truly a gamble
Excellence is proven by example
The ladies smile while the bodies are in shamble
Back off Puba, this ya can't handle
The rhythm homeboy is definitely ringin
The beats and rhymes are the chords that are tinglin
So grab your girl, let's start the jam
For at the helm is a band who's in demand, BREAK.....

Break:

Go (x31)

Ch-ch-ch-champ wit the punch of a verbal grenade
and a rhyme that's equipped as a barricade
Cool and clever, crack I never
Wit my crew I will never sever
Brooklyn, New York is our home town
That is the place we always go down
And every night a party goes down
And when it starts, it never slows down
We boogie to the DJ's non-stop
To the sound of the Brooklyn hip-hop
And if you've ever seen Brooklyn rock
(*scratchin of 'Brooklyn'*) rocks it non-stop, BREAK........

Break:

Go Brooklyn (x15)

Point blank, our deliverance is me but smooth
Stands out like a winner at'cha favorite tune
All tension is released upon the call of the beat
As you rock along to a funky treat
Like a torch, we're keepin you active
Our rhythm will hold you captive
We're perfecters of the poem we sing
Mobbin in to the top with the style's that's addicting
No doubt, about what we capture
A-nother classical treasure
So productive and effective
Chuck it out as a jam that's spreading

It-it ain't nuttin like hip-hop music
You like it 'cause you choose it
Most DJ's won't refuse it
A lotta sucker MC's misuse it
Don't think that Stet can lose it
Too much to gain to abuse it
The name of the game is rapture
This song is complete and captured, BREAK.....",Go Stetsa I

Awaken my conscious to a jubilee
Restore me with everlastin energy
My rhyme does work when I put it to use
Makes me glow when I'm walkin up and down the Deuce
And when I'm shoppin on Delancey buyin brand new gear
Girls always want to whisper somethin in my ear
At a show old ladies even waitin in line
And it all takes place on the count of my rhyme

My rhyme
Talkin 'bout my rhyme

[ Delite ]
My rhyme is the force of sheer suspense
The stroke of elegance and excellence
The best and no less, seizing in your interest
My rhyme is packed with the muscle and finesse
Satisfaction guaranteed as I get ill
Definitely approved that's a thrill to thrill
My rhyme ??????? the escapade
Or at least as a teacher from my trade
Of my rhyme

[ Fruitkwan ]
My rhyme's wrapped in a fury of hate
And dare a devil rhyme rebel my axe terminate
Subduin and pulverizin suckers from afar
Couldn't sling with the king, I'm a hazardous detour
Break north, suckers, I'm intensively hard
My rhyme is on point cause I stay on guard
It might be quiet, but it's deliberated
And when it rocks the mic, it stays motivated

Sayin what I mean, meanin what I say
Hooray, you toot and chant when my rhymes are played
If I may, today, demonstrate my sway
A display like the Grammies shoulda went to Sade
My way, my occupation on the m-i-see
The way I handle my rhyme, they call it mastery
Quakin earth, crashin symbols, ringin bells over towns
And you all want to come hearin Daddy-O's rhyme
Sucker MC's fear it, my fans all cheer it
My rhyme's a category of personafied lyric
Livin, it tastes, feels, hears and sees
You may not believe it, but my rhyme breathes
It only dresses in the freshest gear
And it never wears words that I wore last year
In the summer you may hear it in L.A. at a show
Or at Miami gettin played at a radio show
My rhyme

[ Fruitkwan ]
My rhyme is devious, but believe me it's
One of a kind, you agree from the previous
Rhymes that you're hearin is devastatin
This rhyme made Tschernobyl stop generatin
After effects of my rhyme gets bolder
It move very swift just like a locomotive
The rhymes I possess can surely produce
To any size, big or small, and I can even reduce
My rhyme

Sturdy as a bow, I'm sharp as a arrow
A king among kings, a rhymin pharao
Here to ignite, excite tonight
I'm the daddy of swing, the Rhymorator Delite

We're athletically inclined like a gymnast flip
And rock 'n roll could never ever hip-hop like this
It's to the beat y'all, as I go on and on
Don't stop the wop until you (BREAK YOUR ARM!)
We're on fire, raw, and we're God-conceived
The electrifyin act of intensity
Is mandatorily right the ??? coacts
Better gather up your force or you might get waxed

We-we-we took a little time
Wrote a little rhyme
Spent a little money on some studio time
Came up with a fresh little funky beat
Added a scratch to make it all complete
And now it's on wax, so we can relax
And work a little harder on a little more tracks
It might add up to a little more tax
At the end of the year we claim it all back
When we're coolin on the block we carry our big box
Playin L.L.'s 'Rock the Bells' or Run's 'Rock Box'
Wearin some high-top Cons or some Fila socks
And the newest Benetton sweatshirt in stock
We rent a Cadillac stretch and explore the town
And if some fly girls pass we roll our windows down
And say, ""Hey fly girl, can we take you to the wire?
We're the band called Stet - and we're on fire""
We're ?flyer than chicks? and rollin our punches
And when it comes to rhymes, we write em in bunches

For the keys I hold, one tough blueprint
That dictates zone, whenever I'm blown
You sucka M.C.'s, that's all she wrote
The Rhyme-a-rator, til we beauty ache
Wil the Mellow Frukwan to tell it straight

[Frukwan]
Frukwan! I get 'quipped when I'm on my microphone
Somethin' special keeps me rockin' on and on
And each season, I get a little better
And when they don't hear my voice, I get letters
'cause darken the beats is how I do grips
Make ya rap roast start a boogie and shake
I'm the M-S-K, the Double S-A
Now I bring on Daddy-O, huh, if I may

[Daddy-O]
If there was a time, that I felt fine
Then that is the time, I run my rhyme
'cause at that time my emotions are high
My adrenaline's be, not telling a lie
But if a body penetrated by a spiritual force
My character seems to stake a sector
The thoughts in my mind, start to fluctuate
Til it gets to the point, when I say I'm straight
And a little on hits, most perfect date
Will get a dope, if he ever comes my way

[Delite]
New, reknown, let the part without a start
'cause stay in my machete, is the way of my heart
Con' sting ya, creator, prospered, innovator
To get funky fresh, remain top rated
Being on time be the mastermind
That's right, the are-O-D, is you out to death rhyme
To conquer and prevail, excede without fail
And never let myself within a jail cell

[Frukwan]
For kickin' the mic, can't I do what I like
If I want to please the crowd, let me do it tonight
And when I'm finished wit the end, I will do it again
'cause I could rock all night, and I would have to depend
On the fake m.c.'s, that want to copy a piece
Of my best selling rhymes of the century
And I do want to say, I won't be so amazed
To see a bitin' M.C., quote my rhyme in a phrase

[Daddy-O]
Nowwww! When we came to a party, we don't mess around
We immedietly proceed to throw down
Wit the Rock De La Stet, the alleget, supreme
As we dose through the place, we gon' let out steam
And it'll be like that, to the end of our ring
And it won't be soon, by the way it seem

My first taste of Miami Bass
Came on my first tour, this I gotta relate
I was at the hotel, had nothin to do
Flipped on the radio, heard the 2 Live Crew
Started dancin around, left and went downtown
Bought up some mo' shit, cause the shit was down
Then I said to myself: New York ignited the Bass
But in Miami is where they got the deepest bass
Miami Bass

(Pump that bass)

[ Fruitkwan ]
This may be hard to believe
But in Miami I ain't even wanted to leave
I seen a girl so fly, she caught my eye
With her Benzi box kickin a song, give it a try
So she rolled down her tint with a look that said 'come'
I got real close, and then the telephone rung
You couldn't say I wasn't in a serious place
Cause in Miami the girls got the deepest bass
Miami Bass

(Pump that bass)

[ Delite ]
While cooling in Miami in my fresh limo
I seen a fly girl, so I said hello
She was quite polite, so real and so nice
She asked for my name, I said my name is Delite
I said, ""Now where do you go on a Saturday night?""
She said, ""Downtown, I know the place that's right""
An ace for your taste, a smile for your face
Cause Miami is known for the deepest bass
Miami Bass

Going for swim when the ocean is rugged
A six plus on my kick is how I love it
Heavy rotated, bass is waded
Radio jocks don't understand how it's rated
Want my opinion? It's all about winning
Cause I think big, and in Miami I'ma dig in
Grab me a piece of what I'll never replace
Cause I still say the girls got the deepest bass

(Pump that bass)

[ Daddy-O ]
Now know that it's true, from Stetsasonic to you
That we're from New York, our allegiance is true
We're not makin a fuss, but my man, you can trust
That the bass from Miami is a serious must
So loosen up your body, let your mind be free
Forget all your worries, the drink's on me
And after a while we're gonna wiggle our waist

And if I sat on a bus, it wouldn't be in the back
And I reside in the East and all the Gods say peace
And every since I started rappin' I've been Ebony Chief

I'm readin' Stephen King, Joan Collins ain't my thing
Whenever I got beef, I give [Name] a ring
I cool with Walter and Lumumba in an Aero Star
Yo Wise, a little bit of that human guitar

Thank you
And in karate class love when it's time to spar
I tape the daytime soaps on a VCR
I drink low-fat milk to give my tummy a rest
I use ??? in the shower cause I don't like ???
I eat my ice creams slow, call Puerto-Ricans bro
And when I had a yoyo, I had the one that glowed
I used to make go-karts, now rappin' is my art
Scott La Rock still lives inside my heart

Now I'm a lover of hats, I make money in stracks
Love to watch The Box, music video tracks
Always stayed in school, my mother raised no fool
And if I broke any rules, then my pops got rude
Call me MC Delite a/k/a Shaheed
Here to teach and lead by my rhymin' spree
Make the crowd yell 'ho' when I go solo
Yo Wise, give me a taste of what you gave Daddy-O

I love to cool and relax with a girl that's real
She will chill at my place and I will cook the meal
I've been so many places and saw many faces

On weekdays I build, the weekends I chill
And the closer you listen, you detect the skill
Then you think in your head about the lyric I said

Special dedications to DJ Scratch
And the Albany Projects in Brooklyn, you know what I'm sayin?

We gonna break it down a little somethin like this here

1, 2, and don't forget the Daddy
O is for the only, chief is for relief
People like to talk about the Hip-Hop Band
Not that they get away with it, but they think they can
Cuttin their eyes, and frownin at Wise
And sayin Paul can't cut - kiss my butt
Don't know Bobby, smirkin at D.B.
Boy, stop jockin S-t-e-t
Do what you feel, and if you feel real froggish
Leap on this, so I can bust your lip
Because Allah made man, but man made speech
And speech is only talk, and talk is cheap

[ Delite ]
Well, like a boxer, we got the groove that sticks and moves
Boom! another k.o., and now a major news
No short cuts when it came down to this
Some have wrote us off cause we continued to persist
Without fail, our actions prevail
Success breeds, and the legend unveils
While many pop duty, the Band stood cooly
Till our chance came, and we smashed them rudely
Proved that the soft talk was all pink water
Baked and fried em and threw em all a quarter
Cause when you talk that talk, and your talk is kinda cheap
You reap what you sow, and you sow what you reap

(Action speaks louder than words)	(2x)

[ Daddy-O ]
Aiyo, the situation seems very peculiar
Like the Jungle Brothers said: I'm gonna do ya
But I'm not gonna do ya like a guy does a girl
When I do you, I'm gonna crash your world
Lights out, with the click of a switch you're cut off
You can't handle, so you break north
Then I said it before, and I'ma say it again
I'm the Daddy, O is for the wars I win, friend

[ Delite ]
Speaking of a war, yo, I get excited
The taste of victory, man, keeps me ignited
And like a bolt of light that shoots across the darkness
I'm flippin MC's out by my pin-point sharpness
Punishment is due them, I whip em very thorough
I'm servin up the hype like there ain't no tomorrow
The a-see-t-i-o-n means get the job done
MC Delite, now grab hold to my wisdom

Sittin in the park out in East New York
Soak in the sun, watchin the girlies walk
By, some say ""Hi"", and some say ""Hello""
And some say, ""How you're doin, Daddy-O?""
I say, ""Alright, but the beef I got
Is how the faggot MC's try to cop my spot""
Cause it's cool to occupy your own
But if you come for mine, I'm gonna crash your dome
See, I don't really always want to be the aggressor
But my respect for MC's continues gettin lesser
And just like my mother used to say in the past
Don't let your mouth write a check that your ass can't cash

[ Delite ]
So just imagine all the flack that you'll be catchin
When you're pop that weak, boy, yo, I be bashin
Rip all your bull, to show that we're winnin
By blood, sweat, no tears, we're provin, not pretendin
We daze and amaze till foes are left confused
Like some men treat their women, they get whipped and abused
Cause Stet is rolling strong, so what the hell goes on
Try to gank this, your ass is gettin bombed
Cause action overspeaks above any plight
Peace, sincerely yours from MC Delite

Kickin off a fresh rhyme to a beat that's funky
Splurgin on the style, you feel you gotta
So let loose, sucker, and ???
Why do you even bother?
To call our shit junk 
From the bottom of heart
When you was biting from the start
Of it all, punk
Give me a break, there's no mistake here
Your girl'll be the only thing I take

Rip up ours with ??? scuffle
Hustle and tussle with the best of them
Blow thsyelf a Philly and commence the stompin
R.O. D-e-l-i-t-e
The poet is me, a poetry epitome
Here to stimmulate, to teach and educate
And those who perpetrate, I bend your path straight
Point blank, by the line that tells it all
Hell could freeze and the Stet would still reign tall
Cause our flow is soul and so electro
From my intro pooh-puts are petrol
We strom the stage, rip it kinda slick
A little silver, yeah, we on a different tip
About our silver - our crown to our glory
You want to know - read the real story
And plug in to the smooth reservoir
Complete funky freestyle seminar
Don't ever try to diss us on any issue
Or you'll be outta here like used wet toilet tissue
For the Stet it's cool, we're never living foul
Step wrong, we'll be gankin and buckin wild

I like to jam and party a lot
But I don't like jams where people get shot
But I do like jams that people have fun in
(Say what now?) So let the fun begin (fun, fun, fun)
Startin with the ladies who like to have fun
If the guy can't dance, then go, get another one
And get high on the drug called life
Nuff said from the Dad, so kick it, Delite

[ Delite ]
I'm kickin steps to a new program
Slip, slide in easy, and bam! slam the jam
I heard you liked to party, so what's the fuss about?
Go, go for yours, and turn the mutha out
I stand, this here will shift you into full gear
(In high gear) so tell the rest to stand clear
And bust the footnote: no time for dead bodies
No parkin on the dancefloor, cause I like to party

Now when I'm at a party, I'm settin it off
Cold grab me a cutie, and I break north
Out to the dancefloor, Stetsa style
Break Stetsa fool and get Stetsa wild
3 o'clock in the morning I'm still here
Waitin for the Stet limo to appear
But Daddy-O'll get busy up until that time
Nuff said from the Dad, Dee, say your next rhyme

Lines around the corner, just to see the band
Bodies are packed like sardines in a can
I mean with the boom, said it kinda perfect
No doubt about it, yeah, I come to perk it
P-p-work it on up, what's up, it's time to move your butt
The rhythm thumps that keep you all hyped up
The ruff and the rugged, ain't nothin hip, but
It, so get up, it's time to strut

I like to party

(Take it to the bridge)

[ Daddy-O ]
Parties are made of people, and people make a party
And fights don't make it, cause fights'll ruin your body
When people choose to fight, the party ain't right
And it won't be right for the rest of the night
So take it from the Odad, party for fun
And take it for the Stet band, party for the next one
But don't party with a gun, that's dumb
Just as dumb as a soft MC tryin to get some

[ Delite ]
be	-be	-be	-bass is boomin, on the mic we're stylin
Guys workin up a sweat, damn near buckwildin
You're cool, scopin out the girl that you like
Cause it's true: freaks still come out at night
And as you check your spot you know it's time to mingle
And get on down to the go-go single
We're makin it clear (yeah) from front to rear (a-ha)

She ain't no floosey, though
She's a doosey
Speaking about that girl named Suzy cause she's groovy, baby bubba
Ah, we funky down here, y'all
Come here, Suzy baby
Let me rub you down, Suzy baby
Ah, you fat bubba-mubba-wabba

[ Daddy-O ]
Speaking of a girl named Suzy
Said she'd do anything to soothe me
Take off clothes or put em back on
Ain't that right, Wise? (Word is bond)

[ Wise ]
Comin from the show she was always there
It's like we couldn't get her out of our hair
She would even follow us late at night
Right, Delite? (Yo, believe the hype)

[ Delite ]
Suzy was a girl we couldn't get enough of
Can't say it was love, cause I don't know what it was
Homeboys said she was a real loose cutie
So I tapped the Dad and said, ""Yo, we got a Suzy""

[ Daddy-O ]
Speakin of a girl named Suzy
Yeah, yeah
(Suzy)				(4x)

[ Daddy-O ]
Do you remember that day, we was on the tour bus
Listened to a tape, I think it was the Cold Crush
Suzy heard the tape and said, ""Who's that?""
Delite said (Shhh, just sit on my lap)
She said, ""Okay, whatever you say""
I saw the game and asked: ""Can I play?""
She said, ""Sure,"" I said, ""Really?
And what about the rest of the Stet posse?""
She just smiled and I just grinned
And the band, they got ready to win
Or should I say start, or should I say begin
Anyway you put it, she was all in

[ Wise ]
Started on the tour bus, she was in a rush
(Rush to do what?!) You know what's up
The bus had three rooms, she started in the first
And it was pretty bad, but the second got worse
And in the third I had to tip my hat
(You mean it was like that, hops?) Yo, it was like that
Suzy had a thing for the boys in the band
And the band bein Stet, be assured, my man
Everything that glitters ain't always gold
But for all the groups, yo, she broke the mold

[ Daddy-O ]
Speakin of a girl named Suzy
Yeah, yeah
(Suzy)				(4x)

[ Delite ]
Right before a show ???? D.C.
I looked at Wise, the Dad looked at me
We slapped five while the band got ready
Then we all glanced around for Suzy
Had a monogramm top with our names of each
A two-piece bikini like you wear on a beach
A shape no man could bever forget
And on the back of her shorts - mh, take me to the bridge

(Do it now)

Then one day, it was in the winter
Snow was on the ground, we were leavin Philly
I was in my bunk, geared to my radio
Wrapped in his blanket, cause it was kinda chilly
Not too long after, we all fell asleep
And the snow storm got a lot worse
Our bus driver started dozin off
The bus started driftin, Suzy noticed first
She awoke the crew, and the driver, no doubt
Saved our lives, and that's a fact
And one thing about Suzy, you all should know
She may be a groupie, but we love her to the max, Jack

Ah, Oran Juice Jones
Don't be 'yo baby-in' me, I am not Suzy
Everybody, let me tell you:

A German Sheperd dog with a leash and a flea collar
And a tail and fur and everything?
She's a real dog and she's following em
Because they draggin her on a leash with a can of Alpo in they pockets!

I reside in Chilltown but came from East New York
From a time of bein' broke to a life of luxury
Stay in the house or you won't see much of me
But when I'm out I go to Brooklyn just to chill and max
And from my head to my toes I wear all black
No, I'm not a criminal, playin' with my digital
Lay back in my chair while collectin' my residuals
Cash that I made during winter, summer, fall, spring
But gettin' dissed by a foe is just a small thing
Rememberin' the time I was goin to a talent show
I saw my ex-partner who's now a foe, you know
Anyway, the brother said hi, cool
This took place in Jefferson High School
I was here to observe all the talented acts
He was there to try to battle, here's the facts
Was sittin in my seat, the host grabs a mic
""Stet's Human Mix Machine versus Essence tonight""
I said, ""What? Who set this up?""
The crowd started goin' crazy as they start to erupt
Between every act of people doin' their show
Essence got on the mic and said, ""Wise, let's go""
I didn't want to battle, why waste my time?
He got on stage, kicked beats while his MC started rhymin'
But the timin' stunk like the beats he was kickin', see?
Then his MC started dissin' me
I said nah, I just about had it
Time for me to wax his ass, goddamn it
Then stood up and walked down the aisle, and
You could feel the crowd's presence as they start buck-wildin'
Then hit the stage and grabbed the mic
And said, ""Who's in the house tonight?""
People started screamin' ""Pink House, Brownsville"" with total excitement
""Tilden, East New York"", he got hyped, man
I started with the 'Go Stetsa' roll, ended off 
With 'Faye', said peace and broke north
He was still on stage, at the moment bein' outraged
Due to the fact he lacked and got outstaged
The self-proclaimed King of Beats was hurt
He played me like a high piano and the boy got burnt

And move right to left, from left back to right

Does it feel the same when she calls your name.

To say hello, to say good-bye
Maybe something strikes you funny
Or you don't know exactly why
Ain't no reason to try and hide it

A whole lot easier to let it out
First it's playin' with your eyes
Then it's makin' mischief around your mouth

Feelin' glad to share the ride

Holler 'cheese' and face the Polaroid
Show the love you feel inside

Do you work at a job you despise? Do you live with cockroaches? 
Have you been mugged lately? Did your favorite jeans shrink in the wash? 
Everyone has problems. It doesn't mean you have to be a sourpuss. 
After all, 

The expression you wear on your face is far more important than the clothes you wear on your back. 
Instead of letting the inside influence the outside, make the outside influence the inside. 
Act the way you want to feel. If you want to be happy, start now.
Just smile, just a smile

A smile makes someone who's mad not mad
A smile makes someone who's sad not sad
A smile makes good people outta the bad
A smile is an asset you always had

It can bring you back from the end of the world
Pick you up when you feel down
Put you in touch with your fellow man
Take an ugly situation and turn it around

Classic New York City, everybody shovin'
The crowd was uncouth, gettin' mad, gettin' strange
'Cept the man in the booth, the man makin' change
He looked me in the eye as he handed me a token

He flashed me a smile and a spell was broken
Just a smile, just smile, just a smile, just smile
I bust through that turnstile, I ran to my train
People still looked hostile but somethin' had changed

My express pulled in, the doors swung wide
And I started to grin as I stepped inside
I smiled as the train pulled outta that station
Sort of tickled by the humor of my own situation

Just a smile, just smile, just a smile, just smile
And my attitude spread to all fellow riders
They looked at each other and threw off those blinders
Eyes that were dead suddenly shone

One by one, they were touched, touched to the bone
As they exited that car, great smiles burst forth
Like the evenin' star, like breezes from the north
Then one by one, they all departed

And I saw what the man in the change booth had started
Just smile, just a smile
A smile is a very infectious thing. It spreads joy. 
It's a sign of caring. 
Success or failure is Caused by your mental attitude, not your mental capacity. 

Yes, a smile can pick you up outta the gutter, make you prosperous. 
Now I take taxis. You just have to smile once and the whole world will smile with you. 
And remember that old Chinese proverb: 
""Man without smiling face must not open shot. Paste that in your hat, honey. Smile.""",Smile
Steve,"Well, where's the rhythm I've been searching for
Am I in the flake side looking for, is it just the way it is

And truth, truth is I see the summit now
I'm climbing high, not looking down and that's the way it is, yeah

'Cause I'm still in the race, taking the place from my zealous core
I'm still on my feet taking the heat from my zealous core

Yeah, yeah, I feel the rhythm of your heart
We've been in the race right from the start, it's what we're living for

And truth, truth is the words we're singing out
There's hope today without a doubt and that's the way it is, yeah

Steve,"You wonder when the Lord will renew the strength within you;
You wonder how, how can He use you as you are.
Seems like you're wasting precious time,
But then a voice comes to remind you (to wait).

[Chorus]
Wait, wait, wait on the Lord;
You will understand in time.
Why you must wait,
Wait, wait, wait on the Lord;
Yes He hears you,
But for now you must wait on the Lord.

Answers come slowly to your cries of desperation,
But time is His tool, teaching the greatest lessons learned;
So let Him do His work in you,
And watch the miracles come true as you (wait).

[Chorus]

And He wants you to know that
They that wait on the Lord
Shall renew their strength;
They will rise up with wings as eagles,

They will run, not get weary.
They will walk and not faint;
That's a promise to us when we (wait).

A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust
Steve Alaimo,"A month of nights, a year of days
Octobers drifting into Mays

And you cast your fate to the wind

You shift your course along the breeze
Won't sail up wind on memories
The empty sky is your best friend
And you just cast your fate to the wind

That time has such a way of changing a man throughout the years
And now you're rearranging your life through all your tears
Alone, alone

There never was, there couldn't be
A place in time for men to be
Who'd drink the dark and laugh at day
And let their wildest dreams blow away

Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
Well, you left the only one who ever loved you
And I'm back here on the wild side of life

I'm only a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife

And even the palms seem to be swaying

But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I intend to be independently blue
I want your love but I don't want to borrow
I have it today and give back tomorrow
For my love is your love but there's no love for nobody else",Love Me or Leave Me
Steve Allen,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",St. James' Infirmary

Grab a seat, get strapped in tight
You may have heard about an earthquake ride
But these ones happen deep inside
My life is a chain of troubled times
That which only last a little while
And then when the next one comes along
I'm getting ready to jump, jump, jump

Earthquakey people, jump around
Nothing they can do or say to bring us down
Earthquakey people, jump around
Get ready to shake with the power of sound

Break me up, break me down
Turn my life upside down
Brush it off, there and then
Pick my life up again
I'll still keep on dancing
I'll still keep on dancing

When my daddy left my mum
When I got kicked from the prom
When I got my first pink slip
When my only tooth got chipped
It doesn't matter what you got in store
I'm able to handle so much more
And I never hide away in me
Let's shake it up, shake it up right here

Steve Aoki,"If the leather fades and the children age
And the love we share, separates
In a perfect world do we know we're done?
But I don't wanna grow up, not for anyone!

I wanna be alone, with six at home
I wanna take control of my main oh
If I could free this
I said if I could free this
If I could free this fuckin' madness in my mind!

Free your mind
Free, free your mind
Free your mind
Free, free your mind
Free your mind
Free, free your mind
Free your mind
Free, free your mind

Kells
And if tomorrow I wake up and I'm sixty years old
I hope when I look in the mirror and ask have you lived
I look right and back and say, ""shit, you tell me!""

So I smoke this herb with my homies (Park the car with my homies)
Couldn't afford a roof over my head
Now I let that bitch burn with my homies
We living life in the moment huh
Walk in this bitch like we own this
Screaming out fuck the world 'til it's morning
And if I can free this
Madness, stop the screaming!
Inside of my mind needs freedom
And it's magic, a perfect evening
All I wanna do is have a little sunlight
All I wanna do is drink a little moonshine
I can show these motherfuckers how its done right
But don't nobody ever wanna have a good time

I wish I can see this
I wish I can free this
I wish I can free this
Fucking madness in my mind

Free your mind
Free, free your mind
Free your mind
Free, free your mind
Free your mind
Free, free your mind
Free your mind
Free, free your mind",Free the Madness

Cause I'm not coming down
The battlefields have left me only scars

I'm swimming in the sound

The higher than they climb
The harder they will fall
And we will break their bones until they fold
