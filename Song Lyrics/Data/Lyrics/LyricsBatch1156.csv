Secondhand Serenade,"I'm staring at the glass in front of me,
Is it half empty? Have I ruined all you've given me?
I know I've been selfish,
I know I've been foolish,
But look through that
And you will see,
I'll do better, I know,
Baby, I can do better

If you leave me tonight, I'll wake up alone,
Don't tell me I will make it on my own,
Don't leave me tonight,
This heart of stone will sing till it dies
If you leave me tonight

Sometimes I stare at you while you are sleeping,
I listen to your breathing,
Amazed how I somehow managed to
Sweep you off your feet girl,
Your perfect little feet girl
I took for granted what you do
But I'll do better, I know
Baby, I can do better

If you leave me tonight, I'll wake up alone,
Don't tell me I will make it on my own,
Don't leave me tonight,
This heart of stone will sing till it dies
If you leave me tonight

And don't you know my heart is pumping, oh,
It's putting up the fight,
And I've got this feeling,
That everything's alright,
And don't you see,
I'm not the only one for you
But you're the only one for me

If you leave me tonight I'll wake up alone,

(Stay) If you leave me tonight,
(Close) I'll wake up alone,
(Don't) Don't tell me I will
(Go) Make it on my own,
(Stay) Don't leave me tonight,
(Close) This heart of stone
(Don't) Will sing till it dies
(Go) If you leave me tonight
Don't leave me tonight","Stay Close, Don't Go"
Secondhand Serenade,"Turn Around
Turn Around and fix your eye in my direction
So there is a connection
I can't speak
I can't make a sound to somehow capture your attention
I'm staring at perfection
Take a look at me so you can see
How beautiful you are

You call me a stranger
You say I'm a danger
But all these thoughts are leaving you tonight
I'm broke and abandoned
You are an angel
Making all my dreams come true tonight

I'm confident
But I can't pretend I wasn't terrified to meet you
I knew you could see right through me
I saw my life flash right before my very eyes
And I knew just what we'd turn into
I was hoping that you could see
Take a look at me so you can see

You call me a stranger
You say I'm a danger
But all these thoughts are leaving you tonight
I'm broke and abandoned
You are an angel
Making all my dreams come true tonight

You are an angel
Making all my dreams come true tonight

Take a look at me so you can see
How beautiful you are

Your beauty seems so far away
I'd have to write a thousand songs to make you comprehend how beautiful you are

I know that I can't make you stay
But I would give my final breathe to make you understand how beautiful you are
Understand how beautiful you are

You call me a stranger
You say I'm a danger
But all these thoughts are leaving you tonight
I'm broke and abandoned
You are an angel
Making all my dreams come true tonight

You call me a stranger
You say I'm a danger
You call me a stranger",Stranger
Secondhand Serenade,"Suppose that I missed you
Suppose that I cared
And suppose that I've spent all my nights running scared
And suppose that I was never there

And my eyes are screaming for the sight of you
And tonight I'm dreaming of all the things that we've been through
And I can't hold on to you
So I guess I feel lonely, too

Suppose we were happy
Suppose it was true
And suppose there were cold nights
But we somehow made it through
And suppose that I'm nothing without you

And my eyes are screaming for the sight of you
And tonight I'm dreaming of all the things that we've been through
And I can't hold on to you
So I guess I feel lonely, too

Slow way down,
This break down's eating me alive
And I'm tired, this fight is fighting to survive

Tell me a secret, (I want it)
Tell me a story, (I need it)
I'll listen attentively,
I'll stay awake all night
Allow me to whisper (so softly)
There's nothing I did mean (please help me)
But it's in my body
It's strong enough to fight (Let's make this right)
Please help me make this right

Suppose that I was wrong,
Suppose you were here
And suppose that I reached out and caught your tears
And suppose this fight just disappeared

My eyes are screaming for the sight of you
And tonight I'm dreaming of all the things that we've been through
And I can't hold on to you
So I guess I feel lonely, too
But I'd rather be here with you",Suppose
Secondhand Serenade,"Slow down, the world isn't watching us break down
It's safe to say we are alone now, we're alone now
Not a whisper, the only noise is the receiver
I'm counting the seconds until you break the silence
So please just break the silence

The whispers turn to shouting
The shouting turns to tears
Your tears turn into laughter
And it takes away our fears

So you see, this world doesn't matter to me
I'll give up all I had just to breathe
The same air as you till the day that I die
I can't take my eyes off of you

And I'm longing, for words to describe how I'm feeling
I'm feeling inspired
My world just flip turned upside down
It turns around, saw that's that sound
It's my heart beat, it's getting much louder
My heart beat, is louder than ever
I'm feeling alive, I'm feeling alive

The whispers turn to shouting
The shouting turns to tears
Your tears turn into laughter
And it takes away our fears

So you see, this world doesn't matter to me
I'll give up all I had just to breathe
The same air as you till the day that I die
I can't take my eyes off of you

I'm finally waking up, a twist in my story
It's time I open up, and let your love right through me
I'm finally waking up, a twist in my story
It's time I open up, and let your love right through me
That's what you get
When you see your life in someone else's eyes
That's what you get, that's what you get

So you see, this world doesn't matter to me
I'll give up all I had just to breathe
The same air as you till the day that I die
I can't take my eyes off of you
So you see this world doesn't matter to me
I'll give up all I had just to breathe
The same air as you till the day that I die
I can't take my eyes off of you",A Twist in My Story
Secondhand Serenade,"The buttons on my phone are worn thin
I don't think that I knew the chaos I was getting in
But I've broken all my promises to you
I've broken all my promises to you

Why do you do this to me?
Why do you do this so easily?
You make it hard to smile because
You make it hard to breathe
Why do you do this to me?

A phrasing that's a single tear,
It's harder than I ever feared
And you were left feeling so alone
Because these days aren't easy
Like they have been once before
These days aren't easy anymore

Why do you do this to me?
Why do you do this so easily?
You make it hard to smile because
You make it hard to breathe
Why do you do this to me?

I should've known this wasn't real
And fought it off and fought to feel
What matters most? Everything
That you feel while listening to every word that I sing
I promise you I will bring you home
I will bring you home

Why do you do this to me?
Why do you do this so easily?
You make it hard to smile because
You make it hard to breathe
Why do you do this to me?

Why do you do this to me?
Why do you do this so easily?
You make it hard to smile because
You make it hard to breathe
Why do you do this to me?

To me, to me, to me...",Why
Secondhand Serenade,"Waiting for your call, I'm sick
Call, I'm angry
Call, I'm desperate for your voice
Listening to the song we used to sing in the car
Do you remember, Butterfly, Early Summer
It's playing on repeat
Just like when we would meet, like when we would meet

I was born to tell you I love you,
And I am torn to do what I have to,
To make you mine
Stay with me tonight

Stripped and polished, I am new, I am fresh
I am feeling so ambitious, you and me, flesh to flesh
'Cause every breath that you will take
While you are sitting next to me
Will bring life into my deepest hopes
What's your fantasy?
What's your, what's your, what's your, what's your

I was born to tell you I love you,
And I am torn to do what I have to,
To make you mine
Stay with me tonight

And I'm tired of being all alone,
And this solitary moment
Makes me want to come back home

And I'm tired of being all alone,
And this solitary moment
Makes me want to come back home

And I'm tired of being all alone,
And this solitary moment
Makes me want to come back home

And I'm tired of being all alone,
And this solitary moment
Makes me want to come back home

I was born to tell you I love you
And I am torn to do what I have to,
And I was born to tell you I love you,
And I am torn to do what I have to,
To make you mine
Stay with me tonight",Your Call
Secondhand Serenade,"You can say goodbye
To all the things that you have ever known.
You can say goodbye
And leave behind the life that you have grown.
What's the point
You try to start from scratch
But get let down

You can say goodbye
Just to realise there's no-one left around.
So what am I fighting for.

Tell me
Is there anybody out there
Am I swimming through this empty sea alone
Am I looking for an answer
Or am I trying to find a way to get back home.
Is there anybody out there
Would you hear me if I screamed or if I cried
I'm looking for an answer
And just trying to find a way to survive.

You can live or die
Without the chance to find out what your worth
You can live or die
And never find the one that she'd deserve
You can walk alone
And live behind the shadows in your heart

You can say goodbye
Or live and find out you've been alone right from the start
So what am I fighting for.

Tell me
Is there anybody out there
Am I swimming through this empty sea alone
Am I looking for an answer
Or am I trying to find a way to get back home.
Is there anybody out there
Would you hear me if I screamed or if I cried
I am looking for an answer
And just trying to find a way to survive.

Never thought I would end up all alone
Every day I am feeling further away from home
I can't catch my breath
But I am holding on.

Is there anybody out there
Is this the last time I have to say goodbye
Am I staring at my future
Is it time to take charge of my life

Is there anybody out there
Am I swimming through this empty sea alone
Am I looking for an answer
Or am I trying to find a way to get back home
Is there anybody out there
Would you hear me if I screamed or if I cried
I am looking for an answer

Secondhand Serenade,"Look away, pray for salvation
And pray for a sweet conversation
The problem's not with you
It's without you
I love the way that you told me I'm better
The way you described me in letters
There's nothing I can do
Is there nothing I can do

I'll scream just to get your attention
I have seen what happens to a lonely heart
And I'll scream just to get your attention
I have seen the nightmares that tore us apart

So long, I wish that you would tell me you're wrong
That were not dead and buried
And save your harsh goodbyes
Your salty liquid eyes
And this song is just another song
Don't know why I bother
I can't tell truth from lies
I can't tell truth from lies

I'll scream just to get your attention
I have seen what happens to a lonely heart
And I'll scream just to get your attention
I have seen the nightmares that tore us apart

Your fire's burning bright
It's burning me alive
No one can save me now
Your touch was all I had
It's eating me alive
No one can save me now

I'll scream just to get your attention
I have seen what happens to a lonely heart
And I'll scream just to get your attention
I have seen the nightmares that tore us apart
Your touch was all I had",Nightmares

Your friends think that I am no good all they ever do is try to pull you
Away. but I wont let them ever take you ever take you ever take you.

So long I've waited for this day to find someone to go to and I just want
To tell you that its so on we're leaving yesterday and I don't think life

Dead silence on the phone leading to a dial tone this is not what I have

Secret Agent 8,"Our eyes first met in the old dancehall
That was the day that I let down my guard
Her voice was sweet like candy to my ears
She whispered sweet lollipops for me to hear

She danced so nicely, quite a woman
She said her name I want to hear it again
I said I like the way you move your feet
So baby would you like to dance with me, now girl

Time for a new beginning

Dawn of a century

Of joy and tears

Let your arms enfold us
Through the dark of night

And the wind whispering soft lullabies
Will soothe, so close your weary eyes

Can you feel spirits embracing your soul?
So dream while secrets of darkness unfold

Spinning without control;
The wheels of the heart keep yearning.
For the sound of the singing soul.
And nights are full with weeping.

But, tomorrow is ours for the keeping,
Tomorrow the future's shown.

See the never-ending story,
Come with me to the Gates of Dawn.

The sun from the heaving sea?
The power that ever amazes –
We look, but never will see?
Who scattered the seeds so life could be,
Who coloured the fields of corn?
Who formed the mould that made me – me,
Before the world was born?

Secret Garden,"I remember a meadow one morning in May
With a sky full of dreams that sailed in that day
I was dancing through green waves of grass like the sea
For a moment in time I could feel I was free

There are waves of forgiveness and waves of regret
And the first waves of true love I'll never forget
In the meadow that morning as I wandered alone
There were green waves of yearning for life
Still unknown

Take me home to the meadow that cradles my heart
Where the waves reach as far as you can see
Take me home to the meadow we've been too long apart
I can still hear you calling for me

Take me home to the meadow that cradles my heart
Where the waves reach as far as you can see
Take me home to the meadow we've been too long apart
I can still hear you calling for me

What I'd give to remember that heavenly state
Just a moment in time all mine to create
As I'm taking my last breath, I know what I'll see

Cause everything I love is what I kill for

Secta 7,"I've tried to wrap my mind around the thought of you
I stretched myself so far I nearly come unglued
You hold the universe inside your hands
Still you thought of me

I can't believe
Is there no limit to your love for me
As shallow as this selfish heart can be
You are the maker of reality

And I stand in awe
You are God

Who am I
To understand your ways
Who am I
To give you anything but praise
Who am I
To try and solve the mystery
Behind the heart and soul of all that I believe
Who am I

You're every reason for my heart to hope
Creator of the things I've yet to know
You are the river for my thirsty soul
You are my desire
You are God

I am your child

You gave your life

Don't run back inside, darling, you know just what I'm here for
So you're scared and you're thinking that maybe we ain't that young anymore

Make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain
Waste your summer praying in vain
For a savior to rise from these streets
Well now, I ain't no hero, that's understood
All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood
With a chance to make it good somehow
Hey, what else can we do now?
Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
Well, the night's busting open, these two lanes will take us anywhere
We got one last chance to make it real
To trade in these wings on some wheels
Climb in back, heaven's waiting on down the tracks

We're riding out tonight to case the promised land

From your front porch to my front seat
The door's open but the ride ain't free
And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken
But tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken

There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets
They scream your name at night in the street
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
And in the lonely cool before dawn
You hear their engines rolling on
But when you get to the porch, they're gone on the wind
So Mary, climb in

Speaks from deep
Beneath the cold black water.
It's twice as clear as heaven,
And twice as loud as reason.
It's deep and rich like silt on a riverbed
And just as undisturbing.
The currents mouth below me opens up around me.
Suggests and beckons all while swallowing.
It surrounds and drowns and sweeps me away. 
But I'm so comfortable, too comfortable. 
Shut up shut up shut up shut up
Shut up shut up shut up shut up 
You're saturating me
So how could I let this bring me
Back to my knees again again again 
Under for the third time.
I've been baptized by your voice.
It screams from deep beneath the endless water.
And it's half as high as heaven
And half as clear as reason.
It's cold and black like silt on the riverbed.
But I'm so comfortable.
Far too comfortable.
Why don't you kill me,
I'm weak and numb and insignificant,
And I'm back on my knees.
Lost in euphoria.
I'm back down. I'm in the undertow.
I'm helpless and awake in the undertow.
I'll die within your undertow.

Who kept his ear to the ground, and used himself to find his way
To find his way, to find his way, to find his way

Through a time of life design, a notion that may lose it's shine
A change in stride, another find, the picture clears
He's on his way, a phase
A plan's in place, the fears he had are gone away
He moves with ease,
Through each day his head is high, he's on his way
He's on his way, he's on his way, he's on his way

An ability, to keep himself from traps
That he might normally want to fall into
And throw his opportunities away
He fought it everyday, aware of his mistakes
None of which he could not change
So he simplified his faith and now he's found his way
He's found his way, he's found his way, he's found his way

He's found his comfort zone
A place no one but him can know
It's come clear now that it's near

Seduction,"When you came into my life
You showed me what true love was meant to be
You brought light into my shadows
And made me be your number one priority
And when you hold me in your arms

Drying off the last year of our bind

Why did I run? Why did I hide?
Because the memories bleed on and on

Like thunder in a rainstorm

I ask myself

Could this be love
Or just a memory
Of the two of us together
Lifetime friends forever
You and me a unity
Of friendship and love

As we moved our separate ways that day
Tears ran down my face
And I asked myself
Was I just too weak to face the truth
That love is what I have for you
You're someone special deep down inside
Your love is true, why did I hide?
Why did I run? Why did I hide?
Because the memories bleed on and on

When it was just me and my brother and my mother played

Thought I was brighter than a Polo sweater

But that's no excuse, only you and God know the truth

Never know and so, she goes to the club on the weekend
A little freakin', but them niggas holla
But she never speakin', but tonight I see the devil creepin'
'Cause she been lonely, she ain't felt a man in seven seasons
Damn! She do the best that she can
Her mama tellin' her to find another man
She college educated with a felon boyfriend
That's what she thinkin' tonight

All trough the night she cyant come
The girl is fire inna di morning sun

When the light of the morning comes
It's 6 o'clock and right at the break of dawn
I'm tired and I'm sleeping

I can't believe what I see as I wake up from a heavy groan

She tear up me shirt in a very rude style
Buckle up me arm to the bed she a tie me
No way out, now she lift up her nightie
American girl is out for a ride
There is no regulator
And she's a rude navigator, me 'ave no choice

Seeed,"I had a jackpot girl in my arm 
But over night she had left and gone 
I think I have to call a detective (call a detective)
Call the police and detective (hire a detective)
I searched up and downtown
I searched all day and now the night come
What should I do today is a bad, oh what a sad day
Yes man my woman disappeared
She was the type of girl that I searched for
All my life, everyday
The chapel was chosen wanted all of them to see
I’m going marry her
But the girl was not there
I searched every where ooh yeah
I’m gonna everything do that I can
To find my jackpot girl, she’s the bomb
I think I have to call a detective (call a detective)

Nein mann ich hab deine braut nicht gesehen 
Und überhaupt alter, sie will gehen, lass sie gehen
Okee ich muss gestehn do hast’n mittleres problem
Doch do wirst sehen bald wird wieder rückenwind wehen
Schließ die augen, zähl bis zehn, zack da steht marlene
Dein kopf ist ihr genehm also wird sie ihn dir verdrehen
Vielleicht wird es schiefgehn vielleicht wird’s super, je nach dem
Lass sie kommen, lass sie stehn, das ist bockreich und bequem

Jackpot girl in my arm but over night she had left and gone 
I’m gonna keep up the fire
'Cause never succeeds at last
Don’t be afraid of our divine combination
'Cause as I said, it’s meant to be from creation
And it’s my desperate desire
To get you back right into my arms
You're the jewel that I lost in a deep deep water
Where are you oh please reveal
Jackpot girl, have you seen my jackpot girl
Jackpot girl, has anybody seen my jackpot girl",Jackpot Girl
Seeed,"We sing a song for all the bad minded people
Half of your heart might be ruled by the evil
Still you look for some love in some way
You are afraid, hear what we say

Put the spot on our treasure
The love goddess, the queen of pleasure
Even odd is her measure
A heavy shock cold and hot
She is like the weather
Do not block, better rock

Show what you adore
Take what you've got
Break on through the door
You cannot find more
Than what you look for
Her love shot, increases the score

Love is unkind if you step outta line
She's a cold, she's a warm hearted mother-a-a
Love is divine if you enter right in time
You better check it next time

Put the spot 'pon the queen
We want her, she's so hot
True love goes from one to another
Get, shot her arrow, choose
I to play inna drama
Six kids now call me father

For every coin there's a slot
You miss it once, twice or more
Then you think you had your lot
Queen is known to be moody

Try again till you got through to her
Then she'll say, ""go on your way
Now that's all""
Well, at least you have been heard

Love is unkind if you step outta line
She's a cold, she's a warm hearted mother-a-a
Love is divine if you enter right in time
You better check it next time

You get hot
Another trophy that I'm taking home
You've had a lot
Can I ever please her majesty?
You pick a loss

Had to feel it, yes, she let me know
It's not all that has a sparkle that is gold
Hotter than hot
Love is our treasure
We have a lot

But we've got to pass it over
Don't interrupt
So come let's go and spread it out
And you'll see, we can please her over time

Love is unkind if you step outta line
She's a cold, she's a warm hearted mother-a-a
Love is divine if you enter right in time
You better check it next time

Seeed,"Der Asphaltboden zitterte es wummerte im Ohr
Als ich an einen dicken Beat mein junges Herz verlor
Seit damals gefällt mir die Stadt besser als zuvor
Wenn ich durch Berlin-City cruise is Reggae mein Motor

Ich singe auf dem Fahrrad, mal Bass und mal Tenor
Zuhause dreh ich Sound auf, die Nachbarn ham Humor
Die stehn auf frische Downbeats aus meinem Recordstore
Concrete Jungle, Supersonic - Soundsystemkultur

Wenn Party is, dann sind wir on the dance floor
Der Deejay macht den Vers und die Jarvis den Chor
Du versinkst im Bass wie´ne Moorleiche im Moor
Es zwingt dich in die Knie, denn der Riddim is Hardcore

Wir shaken, was wir haben bis morgens 7 Uhr
Woanders gibt´s 'ne Sperrstunde, bei uns die Müllabfuhr
Dann baun wir´n dickes Rohr, kommt dann schon mal vor
Und blasen dicken Smoke durchs Brandenburger Tor

Im Sommer tut's du gut und im Winter tut's weh

Im Sommer tut's du gut und im Winter tut's weh
Mama Berlin mag Stein und Benzin
Wir lieben deinen Duft, wenn wir um die Häuser ziehen

Die Berliner Luft im Vergleich zu anderen Städten
Bietet leckersten Geschmack, allerbeste Qualitäten
Um Paraden zu feiern und exklusive Feten
Die Massen sind jetzt da, es hat sie niemand drum gebeten!

Früher ging's in Berlin nur um Panzer und Raketen
Heute lebe ich im Osten zwischen Blümchentapeten
Kümmer mich nicht allzu sehr um Taler und Moneten
Baue hier und da´n Track, aber dafür´n konkreten!

Coolness-mäßig platzt die Stadt aus allen Nähten
Aber wo sind jetzt die Typen, die auch ernsthaft antreten
Um ihr Potential, ihre Styles heiß zu kneten
Zuviel Kraft in der Lunge für zu wenige Trompeten

This is my main stage I owe the whole space
Take it for free babes don't wait in vain chase
The slow center of the storm where everything lasts on

I ride on my wave no matter where I got it's there
I fly my light safe, I am declared I am aware that I am fool and brave
I build my thrones, I break my bones
I am my kingdoms rave, I never rest things move on fast

Going for a slowlife, almost understand
Time has got no end, let the soul drive
Going for a slowlife, almost understand
Time has got no end, let the soul drive

Slowly freakin' out, hear me now speakin' out
Won't be speakin' loud
How do you feel about listening to crazy men?
Whose minds, sneakin' out
A hazy sense of evidence for what life is all about

It's real love and everything, a family, no scattering
Daddy swing the children like Hollywood happy end
Just like so many men, I look for almost everything
Meanwhile whistling, here we go sing again

No matter how close to perfect it is
It's taken me too far, I'm afraid, I'm obsessed with it, vex with it
Good's not enough, be the best in it
In order to the best, I can never stop flexin' it

You flex it to the max and it feels like sex with it
It's made you to the boss and you feel you're blessed with it
Now everybody wants it, you start protecting it

Die ganze Halle schwimmt im Bass
Du denkst du kriegst 'n Kind
Alles was ihr über uns gehört habt stimmt

Uh Babe, schwing dein Teil
Teile schwingen, Typen finden's geil
Nananana nanana
Seeed geht ab und ihr geht steil

Du warst Samstag feiern auf unserer geilen Show
Sonntag warst du leider taub und low
Am Montag um sieben kriechst du ins Büro
Montag mittag boxt du deinen Boss K.O.

Dann testest du sein bestes Cabrio
Nimmst dir die Schlüssel für sein Haus und Boot
Bringst ihn vor Frauchen in Erklärungsnot
Bei Chefchen gibt's jetzt nur noch Trockenbrot

Bis jetzt war dein Leben mausetod,
Aber jetzt siehst du rot, alter, jetzt geht's los
Du fliegst um die Welt dank Chef sein Moos
Und beglückst seine Frau und spendest Trost

Du befreist alle Tiere aus allen Zoos
Bringst den Frieden direkt nach Nahost
Jeder fragt sich woher hat der die Power bloß?
Seeed-Sound macht kleine Typen groß

Uh Babe, schwing dein Teil
Teile schwingen, Typen finden's geil
Nananana nanana
Seeed geht ab und ihr geht steil

You can be what you wanna be
We make you strong like a tree with a whole lot of energy
You nah go flee from the enemy
Brave and proud like a boomboxwarrior

Come with me and you gonna see
Jump with me 'cause we're family
Shout an free your teeny little voices
All by the power and force of Seeed

Eine Million aktivierte Klon-Top-Killer
Jagen uns um die Erde wie Godzilla
Denn wir bedrohen jede Religion noch schlimmer als Fernsehn
Denn unser Sound schockt immer

In Berlin hört jede Queen Seeed
Aber Frau Müller weiß
In New York sind wir dicker als Jigga
Seeed in Paris, in New Orleans und Manila
Wegen Seeed sagte Kennedy ich bin ein Berliner

Dann bist do gnadenlos mich und meinen Laden los

Mal hast do sonne und drei Frauen
Dann hast do keine mehr
Zwischen Ultrasex und billigem Geschlechtsverkehr

Behalt ich unseren Weg I'm
Auge aber das is schwer
Was liegt quer

do musst davon ausgehn dass nich alle
Wege I'm Leben nur geradeaus gehen
Den Irrgarten, n paar Schussfahrten
Musst do in Kauf nehmen

Und wer früher ankommen will
Der muss früher aufstehn
Und aus dem Haus gehen

Es muss in jedem fetten Jahr
N verdammtes Beben geben

Manches davon geht daneben

Trust me, dirt tastes dusty
My demons push me and rush me
They got me by the throat like a goat
So I wrote these notes that everybody can see

You know when you're all alone and you're on your own
And you feel stripped down to the bone
Just lying down in the dust and a bloody dirty crust
Is running up and down your nose

Spit it out brother, say it loud brother
Come on, enough is enough, I'm too tough to give it away
One of my demons will pay
For these crazy puzzles I face everyday

You must rebound, stand up my friend

You ain't gonna see me rest till I made my better best
To the good, to the better, to the best
Never gonna let good be my measure
This gonna be my quest mi na go sleep, mi na go rest

More mountains to top, more oceans to dive in
And more beauty to drop and our soul makes it up
We go dead or alive, right now we sing our life
See how these words can drive, where do you wanna arrive?

We wanna move non-stop seeing all your heads up
Don't need a roof on our club, we are all part of the mob
Wanna rock your soul, that's our goal
Gonna pick you up truck around the clock

The moon will guide our way
You and I gonna walk on forever
Until our dying day

The past, gone and over, let the future come
Grab what you can, girl, let us hit and run
Don't you wake the sleeping, don't yo make a sound
And before sunrise we'll slowly sneak out of town

We hear the hound dogs howl from the past (we have to run)
I hear you breathing and my heart pounds fast
Run up the rocky road swim across the sea (we'll overcome)
I swear we'll lose them for they're far too weak

The earth has started shaking behind the velvet rope
Why do settle for less? Our love deserves it all
This city is a mess, I know it's about to fall

They may hold grudge against you and I 
But we don't let them even close to our life
Under black skies we move into a new dawn (We'll overcome) 
The past behind us as we keep moving on

You and I gonna walk on forever
The moon will guide our way
Girl, I know that you and I gonna walk on forever
Until our dying day

A cloud of danger blows in the wind of change
Love has no comfort zone, love is the sweetest strange
Days can be bitter, still you make them taste sweet
And if we ever shiver we'll we create the heat
The seeds we plant will bloom from midnight to high noon
And let the night take the night and carry us through
My nights are daydreams, golden and green
I take a breath and sing ""Oh, long live me queen""

Saw her face underneath my pillow.

See your face outside my window.

When I look at them I write them down.

Seelenluft,"Bobby was a man, he belonged to an old clan,
He had a sword with a handle made of silver,
He was no knight, he just couldn't really fight,
All he wanted was to stand in that magic light

His real aim, who's to blame,
Was to dance on a star,
Like a flame, with no shame,
He would fly so far

Once he touched a ray, but he lost it right away
It left a hole in his chest and he felt empty,
He was aware of the risk but he didn't care,
So he chased the light again,
It made another hole

His real aim, who's to blame,
Was to dance on a star,
Like a flame, with no shame,
He would fly so far

His real aim, it's not a game,
Was to ride on the moon,
Like a flame, with no shame,
He would escape the gloom

Life is a whore, there's no Bobby anymore,
He was more hole than his body so he disappeared,
His only legacy was his sword addressed to me,
Which I don't know, what to do with

His real aim, who's to blame,
Was to dance on a star,

I was looking at all the life 
There were plants and birds and rocks and things 
There was sand and hills and rings 
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz 
And the sky with no clouds 
The heat was hot and the ground was dry 
But the air was full of sound 

I've been through the desert on a horse with no name 
It felt good to be out of the rain 
In the desert you can remember your name 
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain 
La, la

After two days in the desert sun 
My skin began to turn red 
After three days in the desert fun 
I was looking at a river bed 
And the story it told of a river that flowed 
Made me sad to think it was dead 

You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name 
It felt good to be out of the rain 
In the desert you can remember your name 
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain 
La, la 

After nine days I let the horse run free 
'Cause the desert had turned to sea 
There were plants and birds and rocks and things 
there was sand and hills and rings 
The ocean is a desert with it's life underground 
And a perfect disguise above 
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground 
But the humans will give no love

Seether,"I met a girl, who hated the world,
She used her body to sell her soul,
every town, they break her in pain,
tear out her heart and leave her in pain.

I never found out how she survived,
all of the saddness she kept inside,
I never found out how she could lie,
the smile on her face,
and the scratches she'd hide.

You could love her,
if you pay,
you could have her, everyday.
You could love her if you pray,
you could have her, everyway.

Down on her knees,
she wept on the floor,
this hopeless life, she wanted no more,
dead in her mind,
and cold to the bone,
she opened her eyes,
and saw she was alone.

She never found out how much I tried,
all of the saddness she kept, made me blind,
she never found out how much I cried,
held her so tight, on the night that she died.

You could love her,
if you pay,
you could have her, everyday.
You could love her if you pray,
you could have her, everyway.

I never found out how she survived,
a life with lies, is a life with denial.
I never found out how she could lie,
love on her face, and the darkness inside.

You could love her,
if you pay,
you could have her, everyday.
You could love her if you pray,
you could have her, everyway.

You could love her,
if you pay,
you could have her, everyday.
You could love her if you pray,
you could have her, everyway.",Love Her

Seether,"Vacate is a word
Vengeance has no place so near to her
Cannot find a comfort
In this world

Artificial tears
The vessel's stabbed
Next up, volunteers
Vulnerable, wisdom can't adhere

A truant finds home
And a will to hold on
There's a trapdoor in the sun
It's immortality

As privileged as a whore
Victims in demand for public show
Swept out through the cracks
Beneath the door

Holier than thou, how?
Surrendered, executed anyhow
Scrawls dissolved
Cigar box on the floor

A truant finds home
And a will to hold on to
There's a trapdoor in the sun

It's immortality

I cannot stop the thought
Running out the door
Coming up a which way sign
And all good truants must decide

Oh, stripped and sold, mom
And an auctioned forearm
And whiskers in the sink

A truant finds home
And a will to hold on to
Some die just to live, oh

Seether,"I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies
Something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen
And all its sad goodbyes

I'm never gonna dance again
Cause guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find

I'm never gonna dance again
Cause guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

What am I without your love

Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose the crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we wanna say

We could have been so good together
We could have lived this daze forever
Now, who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay

I'm never gonna dance again
Cause guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you",Careless Whisper

You got me feeling sublime
I want to yell it from the rooftops down
Until it's over, and we're older

For my entertainment
You tell a whimsical lie
To keep me complacent
You knock me down with a smile

How did we get here?
How do we pretend everything's alright?
And how do we stay here?
Do we erase all the fear inside?

I feel so alive tonight
You got me feeling sublime
I want to yell it from the rooftops down
Until it's over, and we're older

Like sugar and cyanide
These worlds are gonna collide
I want to yell it from the rooftops down
Until it's over, and we're older

So take me, but go slow
Let me hide somewhere I know
And let this seed grow
Until we finally call this home
So take me, but go slow
Let me hide somewhere I know
And let this seed grow
Until we finally call this home

If I was to die tonight
Would it tear you apart?
Would you yell it from the rooftops down?

I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here

Seger Ellis,"I knew the time had to come
When I'd be held under your thumb
I'm like a pawn in your hand
Moved and compelled, at your command
Whether it's for bad or for good
I would never change it if I could

Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm weak, maybe I'm strong
But nevertheless I'm in love with you
Maybe I'll win, maybe I'll lose
And maybe I'm in for crying the blues
But nevertheless I'm in love with you

Somehow, I know at a glance, the terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking

Maybe I'll live a life of regret, 
And maybe I'll give much more than I get
But nevertheless, I'm in love with you

In spite of all I could do
I went ahead falling for you
So if I laugh or I cry
I made my bed, that's where I'll lie
For what happens there's no excuse
I put my own head in the noose",Nevertheless

Seis Del Solar,"Siempre en la noche mi mamá buscaba el sueño
Frente a la televisión, y me pedía que por favor
No la apagara, su soledad en aquel cuarto cuarto
No aguantaba, aunque jamás lo confesó

Yo niño, no entendía su horror, porque uno es joven
Y no sabe del amor, crecí mirando a mi madre vivir
Aferrada a una esperanza que la enterró, toda
Amargada, dentro de una noche que no acabó

Y mi madre le ha temido a la noche desde el día
Que se fue mi papá
Hoy la miro y comprendo que ella aún piensa
Que las cuentas del alma no se acaban nunca de pagar

Hoy día comprendo su dolor, y lo terrible que es amar
A una ilusión que está atrapada entre la sombra del pasado
Y que en las noches se libera y va a su lado
Como el fantasma de un amor que no murió

De fiesta y ron, noche y rumba
Su plan es falso igual

Vestido a la última moda y perfumado

Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

Way back on Calvary

Selah,"I've had many tears and sorrows
I've had questions for tomorrow
There've been times I didn't know right from wrong
But in every situation
God gave blessed consolation
That my trials only come to make me strong

I've been a lot of places
And I've seen so many faces
But there've been times I've felt so all alone
But in that lonely hour
In that precious, lonely hour
Jesus let me know I was His own

Through it all, through it all
I've learned to trust in Jesus
I've learned to trust in God
Through it all, through it all
I've learned to depend upon His Word

So I thank God for the mountains
And I thank Him for the valleys
I thank Him for the storms He's brought me through
'Cause if I never had a problem
I wouldn't know that He could solve them
I wouldn't know what faith in His Word could do

Through it all, through it all
I've learned to trust in Jesus
I've learned to trust in God
Through it all, through it all
I've learned to depend upon His Word
Yes, I've learned to depend upon His Word
I've learned to depend upon His Word

Along the broken road

I wiped my brow
Kept pushin' through

Pointed straight to you

Led me to where you are

That God bless the broken road

Just passin' through

And give it back to you
But you just smile and take my hand
You've been there you understand

And every lie that gave up hope
We live in the shadow of the fall

It may be unfulfilled
It may be unrestored
But when anything that's shattered is laid before the lord
Just watch and see
It will not be unredeemed

While the firm mark of wrath divine,
His Soul in anguish stood.

Was it for crimes that I had done
He groaned upon the tree
Amazing pity, grace unknown!
And love beyond degree!

Well might the sun in darkness hide
And shut his glories in,
When Christ, the mighty Maker died,
For man the creature sin.

Thus might I hide my blushing face
While His dear cross appears,
Dissolve my heart in thankfulness,
And melt my eyes to tears.

Selah,"What Child is this who laid to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping

This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring Him laud
The Babe, the Son of Mary
The Babe, the Son of Mary

Why lies He in such mean estate
Where ox and ass are feeding
Good Christian, fear for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading

This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring Him laud
The Babe, the Son of Mary

So bring incense, gold, and myrrh
Come peasant, come king to own Him
The King of kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him

Raise, raise, the song on high
The virgin sings Her lullaby
Joy, Joy for Christ is born
The Babe, the Son of Mary

This, this is Christ your King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, Haste to bring Him laud
The Babe, the Son of Mary

Dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander like a
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love, which
Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

Jai Guru Deva, om.
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Darlin' I'm starting to find

I'm getting used to you
Ooh and I'm loving every single thing about you
I'm getting used to you
And I could never get used to living without you

Didn't think that a love could mean that much
But you sure changed my mind with your touch
Never knew that my heart could need you so
Now I know that these arms can't let you go
No they wouldn't even try
'Cause I'm sure that you're the one that I
Oh one that I need in my life

I'm getting used to you
Ooh and I'm loving every single thing about you

I still hear your seawinds blowing
I still see her dark eyes glowing
She was twenty one, when I left Galveston

While I watch the cannons flashin'
I clean my gun, and dream of Galveston

I still see her standing by the water
Standing there looking out to sea
And is she waiting there for me
On the beach where we used to run

Before I dry the tears she's crying
Before I watch your sea birds flying

Es a quién le hago cartas noche y día
Que no puedo entregar

Es el quien me haré tartamuda y mas
Es en quien yo pienso y sueño noche y día,

Y le digo que no me caen los viejos rabos verdes
Y camino a mi cuarto muy lentamente
Con la esperanza de verlo
Y cuando sale a caminar
Me saluda con una sonrisa
Que de veras me conquista

Pero hoy por fin me he decidido de veras
Todo mi amor a confesarle
Toco su puerta y se me enchina la piel
Y me contesta una güera
Y mi corazon se quiebra

Carcacha paso a pasito
No dejes de tambalear
Carcacha, poco a poquito
No nos vayas a dejar
Carcacha, paso a pasito
No dejes de tambalear
Carcacha, poco a poquito
No nos vayas a dejar

Miran muchachas que no me arrepiento
Why tampoco me a me averguenzo yo de mi galan
Aunque se pobre why tenga
Un carro viejo
Me trata como reina
Un hombre de verdad
Why aunque tenga una carcacha
Lo que importa es que voy con el
Tampoco sera el mas guapo
Pero si es mi novio fiel

Carcacha, paso a pasito
No dejes de tambalear
Carcacha, poco a poquito
No nos vayas a dejar
Carcacha, paso a pasito
No dejes de tambalear
Carcacha, poco a poquito
No nos vayas a dejar

Carcacha, paso a pasito
No dejes de tambalear
Carcacha, poco a poquito
No nos vayas a dejar
Carcacha, paso a pasito
No dejes de tambalear
Carcacha, poco a poquito

Selena,"Ahora que ya no estas, me siento libre
Yo voy donde voy, y nadie lo impide
Yo mando mi vida, y ya siento mas feliz
Que nunca, nunca volveré a caer contigo

Ahora que ya no estas, me siento alegre
Ya ha pasado todo, y ya no me duele
De hoy por siempre, solo habrá felicidad aquí en mi alma
Yo de ti, no quiero nada

Porque rompí y las cadenas de tu amor
Y ya nunca nunca volveré
Porque rompí ya las cadenas de tu amor
Y ya nunca mas te quiero ver
Porque he olvidado esos recuerdos de tu amor why tus besos
Y espero alguien nuevo

Que me esta esperando

Y un aburrido de detiene otra vez

es en quién yo pienso y sueno noche y día
El, solo el

Y un viejo me invita, chica ven a verme
Y le digo, no me caen lose viejos rabos verdes

Y camino a mi cuarto muy lentamente
Con la esperanzo de verlo
Y cuando sale a caminar
Me saluda con una sonrisa
Que de veras me conquista

Forget the ones I made

Will I get whatever I want?
I'd be ever so enticing
Eat a lot of icing
Never have to watch my weight
Yeah when I'm gone
I'm gonna come back as a blonde

I wanna I meet myself, as someone else
Just to see what it feels like
Take a walk, on the other side

Break some different hearts, finish what I start

Maybe I'll even
Laugh about it someday

But not today, no
Cause I don't feel so good
I'm tangled up inside

Tomorrow is a mystery to me

And it might be wonderful
It might be magical
It might be everything I've waited for,
A miracle
Oh, and even if I fall in love again
With someone new
It could never be the way I loved you

Letting you go is
Making me feel so cold, yeah
And I've been trying to make
Believe it doesn't hurt

But that makes it worse, yeah
See, I'm a wreck inside
My tongue is tied and my
Whole body feels so weak
The future may be all I really need

And it might be wonderful
It might be magical
It might be everything I've waited for,

The one and only true love
Wasn't it written all over my face, yeah
I loved you like you loved me (oh)
Like something pure and holy
Like something that can never be replaced

And it was be wonderful,
It was magical,

Selena Gomez,"It's the boy you never told I like you,
It's the girl you let get away.
It's the one you saw that day on the train,
But you freaked out and walked away.

It's the plane you wanna catch to Vegas,
Things you swear you'll do before you die,
It's the city of love that waits for you,
But you're to damn scared to fly.

Hit the lights, let the music move you, lose yourself tonight,
Come alive, let the moment take you, lose control tonight.
Hit the lights, let the music move you, lose yourself tonight,
Come alive, let the moment take you, lose control tonight.

It's the time that you totally screwed up,
Still you're trying to get it out your brain.
It's the fight you had when you didn't make up,
It's the past that you're dying to change.
It's all the money that you're saving,
While the good life passes by.
It's all the dreams that never came true,
Cause you're too damn scared to try. (Scared to try.)

Hit the lights, let the music move you, lose yourself tonight,
Come alive, let the moment take you, lose control tonight.
Hit the lights, let the music move you, lose yourself tonight,
Come alive, let the moment take you, lose control tonight.

It's a mad, mad world, gotta make an escape,
It's a perfect world, when you go all the way.
Hit the lights, let the music move you, lose yourself tonight.

So let's go, go, go, go all the way.
Yeah let's go, go, go, go night and day.
From the floor, to the rafters, people raise your glasses,
We could dance forever!

Falling over me
It makes me weak
So damn weak

She crawls in a pit
Say hello darling
Twisted insanity
Fallen humanity
All I want is some tranquility
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?
Well come on, boy

Well come on
And take me to the other side
I'm gon' away
When I look into your eyes
I'm so in love

And then I don't
I'm gonna leave you
And then I won't.
I can't live live with or without you
I can't live live with or without you

Here's my dilemma
One half of me wants ya
And the other half wants to forget
My-my-my dilemma
From the moment I met ya
I just can't get you out of my head (can't get you out of my)

And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted
To my dilemma, my dilemma
It's you, it's you

How you choose to express yourself
It's all your own and I can tell
It comes naturally
It comes naturally

You follow what you feel inside
It's intuitive you don't have to try
It comes naturally, hmm it comes naturally

And it takes my breath away (away, away, away)

You are the thunder and I am the lightning
And I love the way you know who you are
And to me it's exciting
When you know it's meant to be
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
When you're with me, baby
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
Bay bay bay baby

You have a way of moving me
A force of nature, your energy

So I threw her in the lost and found

With a pink trombone and a tuning key
So just ignore the footprints
And just ignore the sand

So wear your ego to the funeral of a frightened man
Saw her standing in the doorway
Fade away

If I were dead
If I were dead she wouldn't love me anymore

Know he's watching her go

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low

Sembradores de la Sierra,"Maquillaje a granel
Usaba a diario y vendía la piel
A precio caro de las 8 alas 10
En una esquina era joven y fiel
La rosa y espina y se llamaba no se
Nunca lo supe nunca le pregunte
Nunca dispuse de su tiempo y su piel
Era un mocoso y tan solo le mire
De pozo en pozo

Y era un pajarillo de blancas alas
De balcón en balcón de plaza en plaza
Vendedora de amor
Ofrecedora para el mejor postor

Cinco inviernos pasaron
Y ahí seguía la misma hora de ayer
La misma esquina era joven y fiel
Y aun tenia la rosa de su piel
Y mas grande la espina
Sonreía al pasar de los mirones
Bajo de aquel farol noche tras noche
Veinte veces se la llevaron presa
Y canto su canción tras de las rejas

Y era un pajarillo de blancas alas
De balcón en balcón de plaza en plaza
Vendedora de amor
Ofrecedora para el mejor postor
No supo nada

Se le arrugo la piel
Y el maquillaje suficiente no fue
Para taparle la huella que dejo
El sexto invierno se le acabo el color
Y hasta el aliento de las 8 a las 10
Solo en las esquina se quedo aquel farol
Y aquella esquina la rosa no sello
Donde se iría y se llamaba no se y sonreía

Semisonic,"Twilight in the sculpture garden
When we walk around the place
Look upon the beautiful secrets
That all the artists' made.

And we still wanna stay
How fast the light has faded
Turn down the noise in the city
At night they turn the water on around the artworks

The dark downtown parade.

In the garden, In the garden.
Underneath the cherry moon
Midnight in the sculpture garden
We can make our own beautiful secret
Rose petal vermillion breezes
We can join the fabled few.

Starlight in the sculpture garden
With a stainless steel balloons

In the garden, In the gardenI beieve the artists knew.
At night they turn the water on around the artworks

Semisonic,"I wandered in the moonlight
A ghost without a friend
All around the starlight found are lost and wounded men.
I know that I did some damage
I wanted to be home again
So I waited for a star my soul to mend

I waited for a star my soul to mend.
She came a long way to love me
And I'm tasting her spark
Now my lips are wet
She came a long way to kiss me
And I want to stay here forever in her light
I know that I don't deserve it
But I want to hear her sigh
I want to stay forever in her light.

Star you're a beautiful sight
Bring me you lovely light
I'll be a satellite, satellite.
Star you're a beautiful sight

Bring me you lovely light
I'll be a satellite, satellite.
And I might want you to shine
And there's a dark crater space in heaven
And there's a bright little place in my head
And darkness blows my mind
I can lie on my back and wonder
Why I've been treated so fine

I'll make love to her while we have tonight.
And make love to her while we have tonight
Star you're a beautiful sight
Bring me you lovely light
Star you're a beautiful sight
I'll be a satellite, satellite.
I'll be a satellite, satellite,
Bring me you lovely light
I'll be a satellite, satellite.

Semisonic,"Last night I dreamed of falling
Down a wishing well.
No one could hear me calling
From where I fell.
And from above the ground
The world and all her sounds

I could faintly hear
Songs, vows, playgrounds, tears.

I fell in a wishing well
And who, who have I become?
Now the damage is done
Not even angels saw me

Bright in my eyes.
From tall starry skies.
And then a searchlight shone upon me
For all this time I prayed

Now stranger I'm afraid
You might come around.
I might call you down.
I fell in a wishing well

Now the damage is done
And who, who have I become?

I'm through with my dream come true.
Then it's just begun
And who, who have I become?
Opened my eyes and woke up twice this morning

Lately getting up has only got me down.
Maybe there's a place where I can live again
Never leave the ground.
I fell in a wishing well
Now the damage is done

(Now the damage is done)

And who, who have I become?
And it's just begun.
I'm through with my dream come true
Who, who have I become

I was old enough to want it but younger than I wanted to be

When I had nobody to call my own
I told her I was looking for somebody to appreciate

Take out your crowbars, take out your knives
Drain out your blood, we all deserve to die

And all the martyrs they have convinced themselves

You'd better stand there's no turning back.

The Bugle sounds and the charge begins

As I plunge on into certain death.

The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall.

We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day.

We get so close near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow

And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear I draw my parting groan.",The Trooper
