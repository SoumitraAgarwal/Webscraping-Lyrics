Mo Thugs,"[Cat Cody]
No, no, no, no, no
We ain't said no names, why'all
We know just who you are
And exactly why you came
Now wouldn't it be real fucked up
If we start namin' names?
We ain't said no names

[Krayzie]
I can remember back in the day
if you bit another nigga
you was considered a biter
Non-originality, simply disrespectin' a true rider
Nigga, I'm fired up
Nigga, keep on bitin' the Bone
and your jaw'll get wired up
Keep on lovin' my song
but my nigga, you ain't Bone
Can you understand what's wrong?
Better get on
Sayin' you been flowin' since back in the day
Some of you was
Well okay, but whatever it was you were stressin'
It wasn't effecting nobody like this way
Hit me, so niggas can miss me with they drama
Tell them all like Willie-D told niggas
""Bitch, play with your mama. 'Cause I'm not your toy.""
So nigga don't test me, cause Krayzie ain't no sample
But really, could you handle
Big old slugs from these here magnum?
Ever since we came with Thuggish Ruggish Bone
Niggas been comin' up out the woods singin'
We stole they flow and song
If that's the case then why when we kick
Wicked shit, muthafuckas all like it?
And then why when you come tryin' to kick my shit
I can tell you strugglin' tryin'?
And back in the day how many niggas
Was really claimin' to be thugs?
Niggas was gangstas
So what the fuck done changed 'em? Huh?
What really be fuckin' my head up
Is when one nigga do somethin', come up
Make a Little bit of money, somebody all on your nuts
I'm keepin' it real, and bitch
If you Feel I'm talkin' bout you
Then it must be the guilt
I think we should give them the murder treatment
Yeah, that should learn 'em, baby

[Krayzie]
Oh, oh, we gonna kill them with the big shotgun
Yeah, fuck why'all niggas who's talkin', nigga
Niggas talkin' shit over here, nigga
Fuck why'all niggas wantin' to do it

Aw shit, these niggas done started over here
They talkin' shit, say we ain't rappin' (What?)
Niggas has got the nerve, and look who platinum
Niggas been runnin' off at the mouth
Before they think and look at the reality
I'm a speak on it, so bitch, be mad at me
Now first of all, why'all can't even talk
why'all need to go get your speech right
And then while you at it
You need quit samplin' that bullshit
And get your beats tight
Let's meet up at midnight in the alley
Where nobody knowin' what's happenin'
What's happenin?
You want to pull out some guns or do some rappin'?
A nigga don't want no problems
But then if he wants to cause it - a nine millimeter
Dawed-off, a .380, TEC-9, comin' out my closet
Probably only have to pull a muthafuckin' twenty-two
Probably just say ""Boo!""
And watch you niggas scuffle, scatter everywhere
Them niggas up outta there
That studio shit been known
To give niggas like you wig-splits
I hear you talkin', woofin' nigga
But I really can't feel shit
Now face it, nigga, rap just ain't the same
Especially since my Mo Thug family encountered the game
The fame is pain, for this I'll pay the price
And niggas tryin' to take my life
Always feelin' violent vibes
Just because I'm shinin' now
In the hood, it was sarcastic shit like
""You paid now, been awhile since you came around.""
So you tellin' me that I ain't down?
But first of all, when I was broke as fuck
You niggas did not give a fuck
Now all of the sudden
Ya lovin' me when we drunk, playa hata
We know who you are, can find out where you live
Better protect your kids
Fuck it, let's blow up his crib
10-o'clock news: ""Nobody lived.""

[Tombstone]
You better roll
Cause we give no love where we got to buck
Break you off somethin' proper with hate
I 'll break you off somethin' proper with love
It's all how you take it
We been never takin' no strippin'
For the body dippin'
Grips in the wasteland all from mad-testin'
Even though they know about death - a cold place to rest in

[Cat Cody]
We know just who you are
And exactly why you came
Now wouldn't it be real fucked up
If we start naming names?
We ain't said no names",Ain't Said No Names

Lately you've been stressin me, that's when I'ma give you some
Callin me, jockin me, sweatin me, gonna rush me none

There's more to a relationship, then jumpin in the sheets
And if that's all you want, then you better go, 'cause that ain't me
I don't give me love to just anybody
If I'm not correct, then prove me wrong and, just hold on
Gradually you'll see, just how good it'll be
When the time is right, I'll ease your mind with a little bump and grind
Fantasies full of ecstasy, we'll have a real good time

Since it's all good baby, we can get it on
Hey, you want to ride? Krayzie Bone
Come and jump in the Benz and tell your friends that you will get with them

Come and let me take ya, got a couple of things I want to show ya
I'm really tryin to know ya, I'm just curious
Is it really all good? You serious (I'm serious)
If it is, then I gotta jump on it, ride it, ghetto cowboy
Surprise, you thought I was quiet, I never was shy baby, niggas just act like
that
Lay back, but don't let that buddah rule ya, give that nigga the bag
'cause we won't have time to talk
I've been peepin for a minute now (Yep, yep, yep) and I know just where I'ma

Because it's almost over?
Yeah, roll or get rolled over
Hey, hey, hey

My first love is my religion
Quickly repentin' for my sinnin'
And it baffles me: how could you hate against the

Not enough artillery for you to
Fight against me and me Mo mighty

You were no kin to me, you my enemy

And all I see is R.I.P
Fin to jack those, lookin' for the backdoor
Fin to act up, when you got robbed
You ain't fast enough
Take ten paces back and watch me blast shit up

Sharp pains to your chest, man, layin'
""Oh, you think we're impressed with your thing?""
I can see straight through you like water

Little nigga hear the fall out

With my diamonds on the world

Now I'm feelin' alright

You believe in love
'Cause I've got something to sing about it

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast you know they never last no, no
What you need is a big strong hand to
Lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Long stem roses are the way to your heart but
He needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees to express himself
You've got to make him express himself, hey hey

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not

For this moment to come alive 
And all my life I've known for sure 
That you'd be coming back for more 

Forever, never gonna let it go forever 
Picked up an old daydream 
Let it take me where I want to be 
Where everybody moved slowly 

And the world was silently asleep 
Now show me where you send the daytime 
Show me all that I never knew before 
I'll let you go away and come back 

I've realized that it's everlasting 
All this time that I've been waiting 
For this moment to come alive 
And all my life I've known for sure

Moa,"I wish that everything
Could be the way it was
But too many things have changed
Time has come, to fulfill promises
Touching came easy
But holding takes more

We shall overcome...

I cry, but I've run out of tears
You used to lick them dry
To ease my pain
Do what it takes to make me
Cry again
Tears are the fruits of unconsciousness

We shall overcome...

I smile, but it's lost without you
You used to make me smile within
My heart
Do what it takes to make me smile again
You know the secrets, you made the code

We shall overcome...
",Overcome
Moa,"You only live twice or so it seems
One life for yourself and one for your dreams
You drift through the years and life seems tame
Till one dream appears and love is it's name

And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on
Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone
This dream is for you, so pay the price
Make one dream come true, you only live twice

And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on
Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone
This dream is for you, so pay the price
Make one dream come true, you only live twice
Make one dream come true, you only live twice
You only
You only live twice

We're rockets on a journey
Exploring me and you

I wish that we could land
On the dark side of the moon
Where no one can see us
Embraced by the gloom
I don't know
Where our trip will end

And for a day the world was ours
I will never forget although time may pass by
How you came to me so tenderly

The night was cold and it felt so old
Until you came with your youthful flame
And suddenly like freed from spell
The night felt young and hot again

And now that time has passed
I still remember your tenderness
Just the thought brings the warmest breeze to my memory
When you came to me so tenderly

Touch me again so tenderly
And I'll survive every day
Cause I'm burning inside, by your sparkling side
Since you came to me so tenderly

Get bodied because you doubted the word
Never fucked your bird, stop askin her
It's not that serious, keep backin up

Send that bitch home on her period

You're the kinda girl that has a little bit more fun
I'm literally yours hun
Cause' I never seen a ass so big with a waist as little as yours hun
And by the expressions on them hotties grills
I know they want to holla at somebody real
And I'm usually lookin' for somebody skilled
Enough to make a nigga say aye aye aye yo niggas get mad 'cause I may slay they hoe
But I don't want to let the a.k. spray so
Stop face fightin' me, like ya face frighten' me
I do this every year so I ain't never scared
I do this everywhere and you ain't never there
They sayin' this everywhere, how could you never hear

I want you give me some of it because minute by minute
Temperature it all a rise because you thighs and all you hips, style
You shockin' it, you a rock it, you a kill it

Pull out the four-five, and kill him motherfuckin dead
Pump his ass with lead
Never fakin moves, motherfucker run the jewels
Buckwild, blowin niggas out the frame
Matter fact, don't call me shorty, kid you know my name
So next time, you see me, you better duck me
Cause I don't give a fuck G
Catch wreck with the tec then I'm out like quick sex
Who's next, bitch ass nigga?

Bitch ass nigga nah you don't want none

Kick it when I'm wicked and all smoked out
The little nigga that gets on your nerves so read about
You say yo shorty trauma, what's all the drama?
I shoot em up like their last name was Farmer
Shorty got the death wish, I wish to die
But when I try, it just goes by
You couldn't kill me because I can't kill myself
And if I got beef then I got it for self
And if I catch a body, I catch it for self
To me, murder is good for the health
Little man paranoid, Mr. Schizophrenic
Thirty-five niggas wanna funk, don't panic
Just shoot a head up, or take your beatin like a man
Or pull a burner if you want a longer lifespan
That's how I see it if I gotta die so be it
But maybe one day, my luck'll run out though
Until then, I couldn't give a FUCK yo
Little shorty one time, I'm goin all out for mines
Cause there won't be a next time
So what you wanna do punk, back up a little
Gimme some space, I'm hittin hearts, street sweeper
A little crazed nigga from the streets
Raised in the ghetto, I'm puttin out heads yo
I'm open, time to catch wreck, put em in check
Snap his neck, grab his loot then jet
Who's next to be a victim - easily ripped up
Get ready to run when I ripped em
Drop to the floor, feel the wrath of the drug war
Call me a thug who gets buck when I want more
Maniac react with a tec 9
Hit me up now cause there won't be a next time
Nah you don't want none

Bitch ass nigga nah you don't want none

Who's that nigga standin with the jewels?
Throw on my hood, cock back the tool
Just to get a rep, yea you god damn right
Just lick lick shots cause I don't fuck with fights
Back on the ave, and five-oh arrive
Chalk on the ground where the motherfucker died
Niggas know who did it but ain't nobody snitchin
No word of to myself, if they do, I'm flippin the script
Settin it off, yo, put em in a dopefiend
And cut em up like protein
The Lord of criminal juvenile crimes committed
Set it some bitch-ass nigga, I'm widdit
You couldn't fuck with the skills of the five foot
And all it takes is a set to get your crew shook
You're fucked up, kid your rap styles sucks

So I threw on my hood, pulled out the banger
Swung it at the kids, that put me in danger
They put away them blades and said
""Why it gotta be like that?""
Cause you get a little ox, and don't know how to act
Yeah, now I got props, and I'm runnin shit
And when it comes to phone time, you don't get none of it
So sit back and just chill
Before you make a lil nigga have to get, ill
Only got a month left, so I gotta be on my best
But yet and still herb niggas wanna put me to the test
So I wild, with a blade and a Kool-Aid smile
Let the juvenile catch wreck for a sec
Damn, I wish I could put my hands on a
Nice-ass tec, and blow a nigga to Babylon
But if you don't, got a knuckle game that's a damn shame
Nigga I feel for, they got you washin drawers
But I refuse, cause I got nuttin to lose
Props I gotta earn, plus I gotta pay my dues
So in the meantime, I got a ox in my pocket
They got me locked in Spofford

Locked down, they got me locked down
Damn, they got me locked down
Locked down, they got me locked down
Damn, they got me locked down

To Spofford, and JV's worse than Rikers
Adolescents that ball hardcore
With the criminal minded juveniles
The real lil niggas step out of the piles
And I'm not takin no shorts while I'm up here
Spit em up, gem stars, but ain't no scars here
Protective custody's got mines
No type of help, I'm in here for self
And so I got locked up on a one to two
On the bus, catchin beef with mad crews
Run my shoes, fuck that, I'm goin out kid
But not too buckwild, cause I gotta finish my bid
Four times, for my peoples up from the 'Bridge
Here, it takes a lot of heart to live
Behind bars, child correction
Trapped in the buckwild dorm E section
They got me smokin the death sticks
Niggas got me fightin for my life, cause shit is real
Shorty kill a man got locked down
You want a buck sixty, you betta betta back down
On the streets a hood, but in here
You're up to no damn good, nigga I wish you would
Try to take mines, and try to shank mines
Shorty corrupt, there's no stoppin me
Even in jail, I tear shit up
And when I get out, it's gonna get worse
The devil in the flesh
I'm puttin hammers on a hearse
So while I'm in here, don't forget my name
Ain't shit changed, I'm still the motherfuckin same
I couldn't bitch up when I got here
Cell wreck, I got shit locked here
One more month I'm goin Uptown
To the big pen, and I'mma still win
Cause jail is my life, and I like it here
Ain't no rules, you can do what you like in here
Jailhouse blues, I miss the ghetto
C.O.'s think they're five-oh's with no heat
So what am I to do when they step
Put em in check, and throw hands with a redneck
And now I got a little crew to watch my back
Lunchtime comes huh, you ain't gettin none of that
Cause I got shit sewn up real tight
Not one bit of fright, while I'm locked in Spofford

Locked down, they got me locked down
Damn, they got me locked down
Locked down, they got me locked down
Damn, they got me locked down
Locked down, they got me locked down

Step in to my highrise hell
You gots to be on the up and up
Watch your back, pump your crack
But don't forget to re-up
A burner's your God and you pray to it all day
Then at night, you catch a body
But it's just the shit you got to do
Cause if you wasn't watchin, they'd catch your ass too
You gotta go all out if you want props
Or you can just kill a man, and it's the same for cops
Now you want a little fame from the drug game
Whether you shoot em up, or pump cracks, it's all the same
But fuck it you're in it to win it
Fat uptown, cookies in the rocks, your spot's hot
Now you're livin the life of a project sad song
Makin your loot from all the right wrongs
But that's the way it goes when you choose your path
And you might just, feel the pain of a tec 22 blast
All out war, with niggas from the next block
You're pullin out the Glock, to shut em down
Now you're Mr. Big Shot in your tribe
Niggas know your name from Mt. Vernon, to Southside
Comin from the streets of Fright
Where the only thing you'll know is how to roll it up right
And load it up, tight, you're startin a block war
Nigga pull the trigga if you want a little more
Frank Nitty style, buckwild
Thirty-eight slugs from uptown thugs
No question, you're true to the game

From skelly tops to props ? and all that

Just a little snot nosed bastard
Always causin havoc, with a blade
But now it's a burner, used, for murder
Step a little closer and your ass is grass
You better move fast 'fore I kick that ass
Cause I'm sharp like glass, but I won't break
Walk into the project hallways is your big mistake

Move, what? I never lose

But the shit ain't real unless you got that buddha filled
Chalm, keep me goin on when I perform
Charge the brain, lick em up, that's the name of the game
So it's the move when I move little smooth

Rock you in your face, stab your brain wit' your nosebone
You all alone in these streets, cousin
Every man for theirself in this land we be gunnin'
And keep them shook crews runnin'
Like they supposed to
They come around but they never come close to
I can see it inside your face
You're in the wrong place

With bullet holes and such
Speak the wrong words man and you will get touched
You can put your whole army against my team and
I guarantee you it'll be your very last time breathin'
Your simple words just don't move me
You're minor, we're major
You all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player
Don't make me have to call your name out
Your crew is featherweight
My gunshots'll make you levitate
I'm only nineteen but my mind is old
And when the things get for real my warm heart turns cold
Another nigga deceased, another story gets told
It ain't nothin' really
Hey, yo dun spark the Phillie
So I can get my mind off these yellowbacked niggas
Why they still alive I don't know, go figure
Meanwhile back in Queens the realness is foundation
If I die I couldn't choose a better location
When the slugs penetrate you feel a burning sensation
Getting closer to God in a tight situation
Now, take these words home and think it through
Or the next rhyme I write might be about you

'cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look
They shook
'cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look
Livin' the live that of diamonds and guns
There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds, earn funds
Some of 'em get shot, locked down and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts end straight up shook ones, shook ones
He ain't a crook son, he's just a shook one, shook one

For every rhyme I write, its 25 to life
Yo, it's a must the gats we trust safeguardin' my life
Ain't no time for hesitation
That only leads to incarceration
You don't know me, there's no relation
Queensbridge niggas don't play
I don't got time for your petty thinking mind
Son, I'm bigga than those claimin' that you pack heat
But you're scared to hold
And when the smoke clears you'll be left with one in your dome
13 years in the projects, my mentality is what, kid
You talk a good one but you don't want it
Sometimes I wonder do I deserve to live
Or am I going to burn in hell for all the things I did
No time to dwell on that 'cause my brain reacts
Front if you want kid, lay on your back
I don't fake jacks kid, you know I bring it to you live
Stay in a child's place, kid you out o' line
Criminal minds thirsty for recognition
I'm sippin' E&J, got my mind flippin'
I'm buggin' think I'm how bizar to hold my hustlin'
Get that loot kid, you know my function
Cause long as I'm alive I'ma live illegal
And once I get on I'ma put on, on my people

Kid, watch your back, one time's comin' always (Yeah)
They lock me up for 12 days,  I can't comprehend
Now I'm a free man on the streets again
Chasin St.Ide's down with some Seagrams Gin
Life is like a dice game and I'm in to win

On the scene from the 41st side of Queens
We get the CREAM, laid up, love-love for dame
Cos I mean what I mean, I'm out to claim King
Doin my thing, do wild stakes my name'll reign

To all my peoples locked down comin back to life
In the world once again though ya bid was trife
While you was gone, we was goin to war and even more
Saw my man layin dead on the floor, kid I swore
That our crew will live forever, I guess I was wrong
No, until we meet again, hold ya head and stay strong(Yeah! )
Yo, got my mind on a place to hide from police(Where?)
Sweatin dogs as I'm runnin cross 12th Street
Just as I approach the block
I spot a jake on the creep down by Vick's weed spot(So what! )
Made a U-ey up the hill plus a change of plans
I had to hurry back so I could warn my man

Ya had me stressin little son, had my heart rapidly pumpin
Niggas start a guttin behind the bushes duckin
My ears rung, I punch a clip into the guns
Got grazed in the arm,  one slug hit my son
He was bleedin from the head, I couldn't believe it
We was defeated, if it was a case I couldn't beat it
Felt like cryin(The temperature's risin)
I saw my man helpless, damn near on the verge of dyin
So to P I passed the iron

Kid you ain't lyin!
I went to stash the murder weapon, plus I'm relyin
On a door to be open, goin in the building, it's a trap!
Police buckin at me, they try to twist my dome back
Jetted up the staircase to the third floor
Reached behind the sink, throw the heater on the floor
Locked the door, police grabbed me up and tryed to break my jaw
""So where's the gun we saw?""(I don't know! )
""We know you was there at the homicide scene""(I know nuttin! )
""And if it wasn't you, was somebody from ya team""

From the cradle to the grave
(Straight from the motherfuckin cradle to the grave!)

Yo,  it's the real drama kills, nobody moves, stand still!
Bottle you! Drop that ass off in a land-fill
Son bless me with the iron, I got beef
With some niggas from the other side over some weak shit
Load up the heaters, greet em with the hollow-tips
Flip em like the Gotti clip, my crew shift the body shift
The cradle to the grave is where I'll end up
Fuck gettin sent up North, son I'm bett-er
Doin my dirt on a low
Fuckin wit them mobbers like a crowd
No doubt you gonna blow, you never know
He didn't even have to go there
Unprepared, now he's six below
Y'know I'm chillin, I gots no time for catchin feelings
Get that money I wants, some brothers wanna act funny
But it's all good I still die for the hood
For my peoples, yeah knock on wood

Triple L, rollin' dice while I put you on
To the drama what I gotta say is short not long
This nigga that I'm beginning to dislike he got me fed
If he doesn't discontinue his bullshit he might be dead
Know him well and probably go way back
But I don't care if he's your man doin shit like that
I hope the word gets back to him,  cause I'll screw him
He shitted on my man and we got plans to do him
Lets get it over with quick, I'm tired of waitin
Ain't no fair overhead there,  we just debatin on when and how
Later on right now, spoke to Killa yesterday
He said to chill for a while
But it's hard acting like everything is alright
I get the chills when I see that nigga in my sight
A dead man walking,  not only that he's still talkin (About what?)
About how and what he did very often
You don't know how much I fiend to put his ass in a coffin
One day my man and the next he's not
Didn't know him long anyway,  so fuck it
It's funny how things change(Word up!)

Mobb Deep,"I used to be in love with this bitch named E&J
Don't fuck with her no more now I fuck with Tanqueray
Tanqueray introduced me to her first cousin Gold
Last name was English and the first name Olde
But Gold couldn't take the dick it made me lazy
We split apart and now I met this new trick Dainy
Now me and Dainy, we been together ever since
Our love combines to form a science, what is this
I bust her cherry, took her virginity in '91
Now that she's open everybody want to tap something
Go get your own don't make me have to fucking clap something
I love my shorty more than life now ain't that something
To love you Dainy more than living itself
Even though my friends tell me she ain't good for my health
When I go pick her up they tell me put her back on the shelf
They say say yo P she only wants you for one thing that's your wealth
But I don't pay attention, cos she's my baby
The Dainy you know she drive me crazy she's my number one lady
Met her back in '89 now she's 22
Acting like she 40, she said all I need is a man to support me
Besides, you from the 41st side of things
And Queensbridge niggas be acting like they kings
Pushing Lexuses, wearing fat diamond rings
My cellular phone reigns supreme, international think rational
The 12th street crew move back when we come through

I think the whole world's going insane
I fill my brain up with Dainy, and drink away the pain
I think the whole world's going insane
I fill my mind up with liquor, and drink away the pain
I think the whole world's losing its brain
I fill my brain up with liquor, and drink away the pain
I think the whole world's going insane
I fill my brain up with Dainy, and drink away the pain

Tommy Hil was my nigga, and others couldn't figure
How me and Hilfiger used to move through with vigor
Had to sit and plan on how to make these seven figures
Said a Brinks is coming through, at Fashion Avenue
At Tuesday at two, now we gotta form a crew
Of motherfuckers, who ain't going out like suckers
Told me call Karl Kani, and all my other brothers
I told my sister Walker, who was the smoothest talker
Negotiate the deal with them other money stalkers
Diesel drove the the beemer, the hatchback of course
Nautica'll navigate to keep us on course
Polo's acting bolo trying to say he the Boss
I said shut the fuck up, the kid is out with the loot sack
Got a big trey pound, itching just to swoop back
Timb is on the roof with the twelve gauge rifle
Scope is on the top so you know he living Eiffel
Took the aim of Oswald, caught him North in the Face
All them other kids they had they tools aimed at space
Levi had the snub so you know they getting laced
Donna Karan was crying, cause mad shells was flying
Damn all we want is a piece of the pie and
Nike scooped the sacks cause he moves like Air
Threw them shits up in the trunk now we up out here
Got back to the mansion, to divvy up the paper
Helly Hansen was the brain of the whole entire caper
So she felt it was right, for her to get the whole slice
Everybody in the crew didn't think it was nice
I guess not, and Guess was hot, so guess what
Guess took the jigga, and jigged her in the gut

When you play with crime sometimes it's not too fly
Even though the goods look deceiving to the eye
The end situation could leave your ass dry
That's why you got to walk on by, walk on by
Walk on by, walk on by, walk on by

My man P put me on to the shorty Henn Rock
Now Henn Rock is strong enough to make your heartbeat stop
One sip I thought the bitch was a fucking warlock
The more she started giving me the stronger I got
Pushed her off to the crew then she started getting jealous
Steamed cos I spent more cream with the fellas
Fuck them niggas spend that cheese on me
See if they be around when you need pussy
Then I thought to myself yo this trick is right
Gathered up all my dough, so I spent the night
I can't help it, she got my brain in a headlock
Niggas started riffing why you tricking yo this shit must stop
Moms like you need to see the AA
Better hope they help your ass out on the same day
But never that, I got the shakes so I need that
Son call me stressed out I just be that
But when it comes to Henn Rock dun I need that
She's my shorty for life so fuck the feedback

Another war story from a thirsty young hustler
Won't trust ya, I'd rather bust ya, and leave your corpse
For the cops to discover, while I be dipping in the Range Rover
All jewelled like Liberace
You watch me while Jakes trying to knock me and lock me
But I'll be on the low sipping Asti Spumante

Over a 3-pack, it was a small thing really, yeah
But keep letting them small things slide and be a failure

Kidnap your children make the situation scarier

I'm caught up in the dirt where your hands get muddy
Plus the outcome turns out to be lovely

Push back the sunroof, let the cold air breeze
Through the butter soft leather upholestry
But mostly, keep the gat closely cause niggas wanna toast me

A-yo I gotta get mines, no matter what the consequences

Cause I wanna chill, laid up in a jacuzzi
Sipping bubbly with my fingers on the Uzi
Try to infiltrate my fort get caught
Dead up in New York, my brain is packed with criminal thoughts
Get your life lost never found again my friend
Mission completed, watch you drop in less than ten
On my road to the riches, hitting snitches off with mad stitches
Your last resting place'll be a ditch kid
No one can stop me, try your style's sloppy

Shank is serving 'em, what's up to all my niggas swerving in
New York metropolis, the Bridge brings apocalypse
Shoot at the clouds feels like, the holy beast is watching us

Gun inside my bad hand I sliced trying to bag grams
I got hoes that used to milk you, niggas who could've killed you

Pumping corruption in the third world we just busting

Hold up and analyze the wildcats slang cracks
They swing an axe, the new routines, be my eyes black's
Playing corners glancing all up in your cornea
Corner ya, seen cats snatch monies up on ya
But late night, candlelight fiend with a crack pipe
It's only right, feeling higher than an airplane right

Take my time, blast a nine, if you front you go

And learned to use my hands for protection
In scuffles, throw all my blows in doubles
I'm coming from Queens motherfucker carrying guns in couples
And wilding, a Q-U soldier
From Lefrak to Rockaway back to Queensbridge
Black it's only crack sales makin niggas act like that
Back in the days we could scrap, now you lay on your back
As things changed with time I traded in my knuckles for a Mac-10
And rather live the life of crime
With my Bed-Stuy connection connected in two
It's liable to start shit too wild for you
Peace to, Baisley, Forty-P get down
And when you outta town represent your ground
Them niggas bleed just like us so show em where we come from
Queens; leavin niggas done Son
The Mobb gets hectic

Shit is for real up in Queens we get hectic
Shit is for real we abouts to get hectic

As we sling on the corners like we always do
Son get that loot quick, spending dough like I never had shit
I'm living large pushin luxury cars
Though that shit is outta reach, anybody in my way gets scarred
Permanently bed-ridden
And if you're pussy, then motherfucker get in where you fit in
As I walk around the streets
Son I got mad beef, I'mma blast you before you blast me
That's my philosophy cause nowadays you gotta be relentless
Grab my Mac and slap a nigga senseless
Don't try to play me if you do you better D.O.A. me
Son I got em shook grab a little baby for shields
You got drama run for shelter for real
Pour some beer for the ill ain't no time to chill
Hit em up cause I'm quick to erupt like this
Wet 'em up with the MAC scratch em off my list
Show em, the real meaning of drama you never had it
Til you bumped heads with the Havoc
Ain't nuttin' soft or sweet, I lift you off your feet
When I cock back the heat, whole crews retreat

Ain't nothing soft or sweet, I lift you off your feet
When I cock back the heat whole crews retreat

We gets hectic
Shit is for real we abouts to get hectic

Everything is real inside my mind; these days
You can't make it if you ain't affiliated with crime
A lifetime of street living
Throughout the beef I've accumulated many slugs have been given
But wilding ain't the way to be living
You're only gonna end up bloody on a floor shivering
Or locked up, caught inside the beast
Meanwhile on the street saying no more peace
My man, Sto-Bo, kid hold your own
In a cell locked down not far from home
And at the same time on the outside I'm representing
Still packin heat make you cowards keep stepping
Getting high, it's cause of the lye, I can't lie
I could move the crowd poppin slugs in the sky
Why come around if you afraid of what's over here
My man Havoc put the bug in my ear

On the real, for real, but wait it gets realer
Real like an innocent child that turn killer
It's thing like that that only makes things iller
And makin cream doin sticks if you ain't a drug dealer

(It's) only facts coming out of my mouth piece
As far as I can see these streets is getting sour
Q, U, too much drama to get into
And niggas regret when they begin to
Regardless of your name or what you been through
Pause for a second, open your eyes and think, duke
Life ain't the game that it seems to be
Fuck a fantasy I'm living in reality
Caught up in this untouchable mentality
Hit you up bad, make you loose a few calories
I need to slow down, movin through life at a high speed
Watchin all the slow runners pass by me
I can see through you, due to, my Queens education
Speaking in behalf of this drug-game nation
The Foundation, the Queens nation",Q.U. -- Hectic
Mobb Deep,"Now, '94 to '95, innocent without crime
(Drop that shit)Yeah, yeah, check it out
Now run for your life, or you wanna get your heat, whatever
We can die together
As long as I send your maggot ass to the essence
I don't give a fuck about my presence
I'm lost in the blocks of hate and can't wait
For the next crab nigga to step and meet fate
I'm lethal when I see you, there is no sequel
24-7, mac 11 is my people
So why you wanna end your little life like this?
Cause now you bump heads with kids that's lifeless
I live by the day only if I survive
The last night, damn right, I ain't tryin' to fight
We can settle this like some grown men on the concrete floor
My slugs will put a stop to your hardcore
Ways of action, I grab the gat, then
Ain't no turning back when I start blastin'
Pick up the handle and insert the potion
Cock the shit back in a calm like motion
No signs of anger or fear cause you the one in danger
Never share your plans with a stranger, word is bond

I put the drop on you kid, now I got you
You got the heart to get busy without your crew?
Let's get it on nigga, do what we gotta do
You buckin' me, I'm buckin' right back at you
I put the drop on you kid, now I got you
You got the heart to get busy without your crew?
Let's get it on nigga, do what we gotta do
You buckin' me, I'm buckin' right back at you

Fuck where you at kid, it's where you're from
Cause where I'm from, niggas pack nothin' but the big guns
Around my way, niggas don't got remorse for out-of-towners
Come through fronting and get stuffed with the 3-pounder
The loud sounder, ear ringer
And I'm a point the finger, at all you wannabe gunslingers
You got a real ice grill but are you really real
Step to the hill and I'ma test your gun skills
Cause real niggas don't try to profile
You just a chump who needs to get drunk to buckwild
But swing that bullshit this way
And I'm a make your visit to the bridge a motherfucking short stay
Queensbridge, that's where I'm from
The place where stars are born and phony rappers get done
6 blocks and you might not make it through
What you gonna do when my whole crew is blazing at you
With macs and tecs to lend to get your dome crush
You thought that you could come around my way and beef, stupid fuck
What the hell you smoking? What the fuck possessed you
To come out your face, now I have to wet you
Throw on my Timbs, black mask and black serpent
Twist a nigga cap, then jump in the J-30

I put the drop on you kid, now I got you
You got the heart to get busy without your crew?
Let's get it on nigga, do what we gotta do
You buckin' me, I'm buckin' right back at you

Who's the richest nigga in the project, who got it locked
Rocking Convertibles, drop tops and mad hot
Peace to that whiz kid and playas on his team
Who's organized, all eyeballs is on CREAM
And your whole clique got nothin' but raw shit
Whip after whip, stay flashing your dick on tricks
Your whole crew's ravishing, team's untouchable
In the jungle, banging NaS, Mobb Deep and Wu
There's money out there, guns catch crumbs, those are your sons
Jums is in the mailboxes, bitches holding your guns
You know what's out there, thousands of gram, wrapped in Saran
Sealed tight, keep the freshness, that's how we expand
Masked Avenger, drop your gun, son, now surrender
Get ninjaed on the island, plus the Bridge, boy remember

My little thug's selling drugs and he's struggling
The game got him bugging, I tried to tell him slow down cousin
But he vexed and niggas getting wet up in the projects
But with no doubt, shorties out for his respect
But is his brain insane from the lye?
From smoking that 118 tiny tye
Why, a nigga just died last week
As he swore he was grown and he's a thug in the street
But it's like that, my crew pump cracks and we pack mac
His eyes is wild with the rezzy monkey on his back
But I'm stressed and he need to be blessed
With a firepack, don't even go there cause it ain't like that
Slow down baby, he said, what, you trying to play me?
You must be crazy, pulled out the heat and almost blazed me
Then he was Swayze, the shot must of dazed me
Thug selling drugs, busting slugs, but he ain't crazy",Right Back at You
Mobb Deep,"I got you stuck off the realness, we be the infamous
You heard of us, official Queensbridge murderers
The Mobb comes equipped for warfare, beware
Of my crime family who got nuff shots to share
For all of those, who wanna profile and pose
Rock you in your face, stab your brain with your nose bone
You all alone in these streets, cousin
Every man for they self in this land we be gunning
And keep them shook crews running, like they supposed to
They come around but they never come close to
I can see it inside your face, you're in the wrong place
Cowards like you just get they whole body laced up
With bullet holes and such
Speak the wrong words man and you will get touched
You can put your whole army against my team and
I guarantee you it'll be your very last time breathing
Your simple words just don't move me, you're minor, we're major
You're all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player
Don't make me have to call your name out
Your crew is featherweight, my gunshots'll make you levitate
I'm only nineteen but my mind is old
And when the things get for real my warm heart turns cold
Another nigga deceased, another story gets told
It ain't nothing really, hey, yo dun spark the Phillie
So I can get my mind off these yellowbacked niggas
Why they still alive I don't know, go figure
Meanwhile back in Queens the realness and foundation
If I die I couldn't choose a better location
When the slugs penetrate you feel a burning sensation
Getting closer to God in a tight situation
Now, take these words home and think it through
Or the next rhyme I write might be about you

Son, they shook
Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look
Living the live that of diamonds and guns
There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds
Some get shot, locked down and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts and straight up shook ones, shook ones
He ain't a crook son, he's just a shook one

For every rhyme I write it's 25 to life
Yo it's a must, in gats we trust, safeguarding my life
Ain't no time for hesitation, that only leads to incarceration
You don't know me, there's no relation
Queensbridge and we don't play, I don't got time
For your petty thinking mind, son I'm bigger than those
Claiming that you pack heat but you're scared to hold
And once the smoke clears you'll be left with one in your dome
13 years in the projects, my mentality is what, kid?
You talk a good one but you don't want it
Sometimes I wonder do I deserve to live
Or am I going to burn in hell for all the things I did
No time to dwell on that cause my brain reacts
Front if you want kid, lay on your back
I don't fake jacks kid, you know I bring it to you live
Stay in a child's place, kid you outta line
Criminal minds thirsty for recognition
I'm sipping, E&J got my mind flipping
I'm bugging, digging my ways out of holes by hustling
Get that loot kid, you know my function
Cause long as I'm alive I'mma live illegal
And once I get on I'mma put on all my people
React mix to lyrics like Macs I hit your dome up
When I roll up, don't be caught sleeping cause I'm creeping

Son, they shook
Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks

There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds

Mobb Deep,"I keep it real pack steel like my man Y.G
When a fool try to play me wet 'em up then I'm Swayze
You must be crazy kid
Man I never did forever wildin' that's how we live up in the Bridge
You just sit scared cock back the gat then hit a nigga like a bid
25 naw kid you gettin' life
Forever burnin' in hell niggas is trife
It's the, semi auto you can bring it on yo
I'm pullin' out strippin' niggas just like a porno flick
I'm sick the Mobb rolls thick
Cross paths with my clique and get vic
I'm on some bullshit that's how I was raised G
Slept at the stage have you slippin' down blazin'
In pools of alcohol walk before you crawl
I'm in this to win this you gonna take a fall
Infamous Queensbridge kid we on the scene kid
Creepin' for those that's caught sleepin'
Don't ever do that I run with two macs
And plus my crew back my every move
I choose givin' crews the blues
I'm open off the Damey
Obey me or get sprayed with the sweeper
Cause I'm my brothers keeper
The Grim Reaper holdin' with nothin' but big batters
And big heaters
Blow ya three times leave a mark like Adidas
Jig you I know how to fix you
Pretty boy niggas frontin' hard is the issue
Word to my unborn you get scolded
Old and molded when I get bent you get folded
Every rhyme is the truth that I must get cross
Put your right on your back take it to the source
No doubt I'm stuck and I can't get out
Of this lifestyle the 41st side get bent run wild
The 41st side two you know how we do
Violate motherfucker I'm a see you, with the Lenden
It's the start of your endin' settin' it again and again

Yo, it's the P. E. double push a Lex bubble in the winter
You can't come alone only the hoes can enter
Told him to meet me at six on the hill at the center
Took her to the west way and bent her right over
Stay intoxicated, never sober
Face it, violate and get laced while you wasting
Slugs you ain't buckin' nothing
You better off buckin' yourself you need to stop fronting
I used to drive an Ac and kept a Mac in the engine
Littles painted it black with crack sale intentions
To blow up the whole projects the Infamous
Our sons will grow up to be murderers and terrorists
It's the nigga in me accompanied by the cognac
You can ask around, don't fuck with the Mobb
I could've told you that, where you been at
You must have cut class
If it ain't me, another member of my crew will kick your ass (what what)
We do damage to limbs
In '91, stomping you out with black Timbs
Prodigy and the H.A.V.O.C. from the Q.B.C
Putting cowards where they're supposed to be
If I don't know your face then don't come close to me
I got too much beef for that
Drama in the 3rd degree
And to the kids you don't wanna be me
I'm up in the mix of action, where niggas wanna kill me
But it's the start of they ending my man's lending
Me his linden forty-two shots depending
On whether or not the clip is full to the top
We busting caps non-stop
Blazing in all the shows and even at the hoes

Naw naw chill son chill

And it's the start of your ending
Yeah, yeah it's the start of niggas ending, you know what I'm sayin?
And it's the start of your ending
All y'all weak-ass crews that got drama with mines, you know what I'm sayin'
It's the start of your ending
And it's the motherfuckin' start of the ending
You know who you fuckin' with
(Yeah, yeah nigga) you know what will happen
(Recognize and realize)
41st side get bent, run wild

Word up you know what I'm sayin'?",The Start of Your Ending (41st Side)
Mobb Deep,"Yeah
Sendin' this one out, to my man Killa be
No doubt indeed, without weed, know what I'm sayin'?
That old real shi'

There's a war goin' on outside  no man is safe from
You could run but you can't hide forever
From these  streets  that we done took
You walkin' witcha head down scared to look
You shook  cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
They never around when the beef cooks in my part of town
It's similar to Vietnam
Now we all grown up and old, and beyond the cop's control
They better have the riot gear ready
Tryin' to bag me and get rocked steady
By the mac one-double, I touch you
And leave you with not much to go home wit'
My skin is thick, cause I be up in the mix of action
If I'm not at home, puffin lye relaxin'
New York got a nigga depressed
So I wear a slug-proof underneath my Guess
God bless my soul, before I put my foot down and begin to stroll
And to the drama I built, and all unfinished beef
You will soon be killed, put us together
It's like mixin' vodka and milk
I'm goin' out blastin', takin' my enemies with me
And if not, they scarred, so they will never forget me
Lord forgive me the Hennesey got me not knowin' how to act
I'm fallin' and I can't turn back
Or maybe it's the words from my man Killa Black
That I can't say so it's left a untold fact, until my death
My goal's to stay alive
Survival of the fit only the strong survive

Yo, yo
We livin' this til the day that we die
Survival of the fit only the strong survive

We livin' this til the day that we die

Survival of the fit only the strong survive
(survival of the fit only the strong)

I'm trapped, in between two worlds, tryin' to get dough ya know
When the dough get low the jewels go, but never that
As long as fiends smoke crack
I'll be on the block hustlin countin' my stacks
No doubt, watchin' my back and proceed with caution
Five-oh lurkin', no time to get lost in the system
Niggas usin' fake names to get out quick
My brother did it and got bagged with two ounces
I-llegal world where squads hit the block hard
Ask my man Twin when he got bagged, that fucked me up God
But shit happens for a reason
You find out who's your true peoples when you're upstate bleedin'
You can't find a shorty to troop your bid wit'chu
Hit wit a 2 to 4 it's difficult
Wild on the streets I try to maintain
Tight with my loot, cause hoes like to run game
Some niggas like to trick but I ain't wit that trickin' shit
I'm like a Jew, savin' dough so I can big whip
Pushin' a Lex, now I'm set, ready to jet
No matter how much loot I get I'm stayin' in the projects, forever
Jakes on the blocks we out-clever
If beef, we never separate and pull together
When worse comes to worse and my peoples come first
Try to react and get them motherfuckin' feelings hurt
My crew's all about loot
Fuck lookin' cute, I'm strictly Timb boots and army certified suits
Puffin L's, laid back, enjoyin' the smell
In the Bridge gettin' down it ain't hard to tell
You better realize

We livin' this til the day that we die
Survival of the fit only the strong survive

Mobb Deep,"Word up, son, I heard they got you on the run
For a body - now it's time to stash the guns
They probably got the phones tapped so I won't speak long
Gimme a hot second, and I'mma put you on
It's all messed up somebody snitchin on the crew
And word is on the street is they got pictures of you
Homicide came to the crib last night, six deep
Askin' on your whereabouts and where d'you sleep
They said they just wanna question you, but me and you know
That once they catch you, all they do is just arrest you
Then arraign you, hang you, I don't think so
It's a good thing you bounced for now just stay low
Once in a blue I check to see how you're doin
I know you need loot, so I send it through Western Union
They probably knock down the door
In the middle of the night, sometimes around four
Hopin to find who they lookin for but they won't succeed
All they gonna find is mad empty bags of weed
But word son, you got the projects hotter than hell
Harder for brothers, to get they thug on but oh well
Son they know too much, even the hoodrat chicks
Oh you heard who did what, no I don't know who did shit!
So stop askin, then I know I'm not goin crazy
From windows, I see lights flashin and maybe
Somebody's takin' pictures - you know who that be
Police lovers, and neighborhood snitches
They put up your sheet so everybody's pointin fingers
And lyin, aiyyo son, the temp is risin

The temperature's risin, no there's nothin surprisin
The temperature's risin, huh and ain't nothin surprisin
The temperature's risin, huh and ain't nothin surprisin
The temperature's risin (There's nothin surprisin)

What up black? Hold your head wherever you at
On the flow from the cops with wings on your back
That snitch nigga - gave police your location
We'll chop his body up in six degrees of separation
Killer listen, shit ain't the same without you at home
Phony niggas walk around tryin to be your clone
They really fear you, when you was at home they was pale
That's why they wanna see you either dead or in jail
By the time you hear this rhyme you'll probably be locked up
Tried to hide somewhere along the lines your plans slipped up
Got caught up in a crime that you can't take back
Reminisce on how I used to pick you up in the Ac
Years ago when we was younger seemed the hood took us under very deep
Wonderin who snitched it got me losin lots of sleep
At night, you know my mouth is tight
I never sang to the cops cause that shit ain't right
Sometimes I stroll past the scene of the crime and backtrack
Damn - why the situation go down like dat?
It'll be a long time before the heat dies down
And a - couple of years 'fore we see you around
Butt 'til then maintain and keep your story the same
The cops is grabbin wrong niggas, lookin for someone to blame
They harrassin, strugglin to find the truth
There's a chance ya case'll get thrown out, cause they ain't got no proof
To say you're guilty, your fingerprints filthy
Deliver - me the gun, I'll tie it to a brick and throw it in the river
Make sure it sinks to the bottom
Outsmart police, snuck you out the projects, we got 'em
But still, but still, but still

The temperature's risin, no there's nothin surprisin
The temperature's risin, huh and ain't nothin surprisin
The temperature's risin, huh and ain't nothin surprisin

Mobb Deep,"It's just another day, drowning my troubles with a forty
That's when I got the call from this brown skin shorty
She asked me where's my crew at, said we could do whatever
She got a crew too and said that we should get together
I said, ""Aight, just call me back in a hour
So I can take a shower and gather up the manpower""
Then I hung up the horn
And I thought to myself that it might be on
Cause this trick ain't pick up the phone to call me in years (Why?)
Ever since I left the ho lonely in tears
Ain't no telling what her friends putting up in her ears
Ideas of setting me up I'm not trying to hear
(Check it out, Son) So we take the gats for precautions
Plus this trick live in Brooklyn, home of the coffin
She might got a whole batallion of Bucktowners
Waiting for us to get up off the train and surround us
Or maybe I'm blowing this shit out of proportion
But this shit do happen to niggas very often
So fuck it, a nigga gotta do what he meant to
My crew got my back, fuck the world is my mental
We put together five soldiers
The bitch called, my blood curdled
Told me to meet her on Myrtle
Got to the plaza, we're waiting for the G train
We put a plan together, just in case the beef came
Now we Bed Stuy bound
Far from home and on unknown ground
But together we six deep, with five heats, nothing sweet
First nigga fronting getting lifted off his fucking feet
It took eternity, we reached our destination
My heartbeat is racing like a cardiac patient
We finally got to Myrtle outside the train station
I saw not a soul, told my peoples to be patient
But hold up, that's when a black caravan rolled up
My legs then froze up, I grabbed my pound
Told my man, ""Eyes open cause it might go down""
Said he don't like the way the shit is starting to sound
Evey angle of the car was smoked out and tinted
So we couldn't tell if the enemy was in it
It might have been TNT, I wasn't trying to wait and see, we
Jetted thru Marcy cause D's ain't bagging me
Word Son, they got us on the run, dun, see yo

Check it out, check it out, check it out, yo
Trife life got me thinking like an animal
No doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt yo
What can kill you is what you don't know

OK check it, you're on your way to your girl's crib
But the bitch live in the Bridge
You ain't really sweating it, cause little do you know
The niggas in the Bridge be setting it
You thought you was safe and tried to walk the back streets without heat
On the 41st Side of 12th Street
The side where niggas don't give a fuck
The side where if you come through fronting, kid you getting bucked
On your way, to apartment 3A
With a phat herringbone, let him slide, no days
Son get the heat, cause I'm about to stick him
(Fuck that shit, yo if that nigga front, yo hit him!)
Aight bet, so just hold it down
While I cock back the long three pound
You're upstairs boning, not knowing that I'm scheming
Just the right time kid, it's twelve in the evening
You're leaving out the building as you kiss your girl goodbye
Thought you was safe and got caught by surprised
""What's goin on?"", as I reply
""Shut the fuck up and don't make this to another homicide""
He tried to play tough so I put one in his brain
Even though I took his life, all I wanted was his chain
Come through truck without heat, how you figure?
When you in the projects keep your fingers on the trigger
But fuck that we're juxing, if you got what we like you gets tooken
Put you on your back, send you on your way, yo good looking
Now we catching a cab to Halsey & Lewis in Brooklyn
Getting tore up from the floor up, hit the dress store up
Got the 80-0 in case a nigga wanna roll up
Get your motherfucking shit swoll up
Now it's back to Queens to serve fiends
Making G's by any means, my eyes on my enemies
Sipping Hennessey, with my mind on some crime shit
One-time searching me but never ever find shit
It's the everyday, get the loot then breeze
Though my goal is to leave outta state, push ki's
But all this bullshit holding me down, I can't leave
Fuck a 9-to-5, I get the loot with ease
Don't even need a degree to earn a six-digit figure
I get mines slinging on the corner with my niggas
Pulling the trigger when the drama appears
Cause a nigga worse enemy is fear
So yo

Check it out, check it out, check it out, yo
Trife life got me thinking like an animal
No doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt yo
What can kill you is what you don't know",Trife Life
Mobb Deep,"It all began on the street, to the back of a blue police vehicle
Next come the bookings, the way things is lookin
It's Friday, you in for a long stay
Gettin shackled on the bus first thing come Monday
Hopin in your mind you'll be released one day
But knowin, home is a place you're not goin for a long while
Now you're up on the isle
In a position that you ain't got to refusin to smile
But keep in mind there's a brighter day, after your time spent
Used to be wild, but locked up, you can't get bent
Thought you could hack it, now you're requestin P
See you're fragile, it ain't hard to see
Niggas like that don't associate with me
I'd rather, get busy to the third degree
Cause the wrong population's on infinitely
If this was the street, my razor would be a mac demon
Hit you up, leave your whole face screamin'
What you in for kid - bustin nuts?
Cats heard of me in street stories told inside this trap
Who are you to look at me with your eyes like that
Wisen up young blood, before you make things escalate
And I would hate yo set your crooked ass straight

Livin' the high life, make your moves at night
Pack your heat in this war zone, niggas is trife
Runnin from one time, ain't no time to slip
Make one false move and it's a up north trip
Livin the high life, make your moves at night
Pack your heat in this war zone, niggas is trife
Runnin from one time, ain't no time to slip
Make one false move and it's a up north trip

You tried to dip, duck, but still got bucked
You talk too much shit, you shoulda kept your mouth shut
All that gossip, motherfucker don't you know my Glock kicks
Hollow tips, to your body, mad toxic
I fade you, blow you with a rusty-ass razor
Did you a favor, tried to wet you but I graze you
Pop goes the Glock when there's beef on the block
Chill for a while make them think the beef stop
Then I creep like a thief in the night, it's only right
Ain't no turnin back, it's on tonight
And if I get caught then my ass is up north
Straight on the course for upstate New York
Stress, smokin back to back cigarettes
It popped off, one point in the mess hall
But to avoid that, from head to toe, dipped in all black
Hit them niggas where they pump they cracks at
Havoc, with the murder master plan
Keep my nine up to par, so my shit won't jam
God forbid if my shit do, run behind a tree
Fix my shit then hit you, slugs in your body
Mainly in your brain tissue
Witness from the scene, get ghost, stash the pistol
So simple then, watch my back, lay up and relax
Roll a sack, K-A black, find a shorty to tag

Livin' the high life, make your moves at night
Pack your heat in this war zone, niggas is trife
Runnin from one time, ain't no time to slip
Make one false move and it's a up north trip
Livin the high life, make your moves at night
Pack your heat in this war zone, niggas is trife
Runnin from one time, ain't no time to slip
Make one false move and it's a up north trip

I got the powder, combine wit the powder, and water
It oughta, drop in a half and hour
In the, form of oil, watch the cocaine boil
Keep my eye on it so the shit won't spoil
Then I pause... and ask God why
Did he put me on this Earth, just so I could die
I sit back and build on, all the things I did wrong
Why I'm still breathin, and all my friends gone
I try not to dwell on the subject for a while
Cause I might get stuck in this corrupt lifestyle
But my, heart pumps foul blood through my arteries
And I can't turn it back it's a part of me
Too late for cryin, I'm a grown man strugglin
To reach the next level of life, without fumblin
Down to foldin I got no shoulder to lean on but my own
All alone in this danger zone
Time waits for no man, the streets grow worse
Fuck the whole world kid my money comes first
Cause I'm out for the gusto, and trust nobody
If you're not family, then you die by me
Cause niggas will have you locked up the snitch'll be your man
Givin police the run down on your plans
We're never goin down like that
So I, shut my mouth and hold my words back
Illegal business, forever mine, fuck payin taxes
The last kid that shitted and gave police access
To my blueprints, used names as evidence
Skipped town and I haven't seen the snitch nigga ever since
The moral of the story is easy to figure out
A lesson that you can't live without

Make your moves at night
Pack your heat in this war zone, niggas is trife
Runnin from one time, ain't no time to slip
Make one false move and it's a up north trip

Mobb Deep,"I got my clique ready ready for hand to hand combo 
Harms break em down rapper Noyd cut his throat 
Don swoop em up or Gotti stomp em out 
Each twin grab a arm  pick this nigga up 
Knitty turn his face to me  let me break him up 
I throw him up against the wall and put a hole in his face so big 
it almost took his whole face off 
We got to take position  ready for faceoff 

With blitz like Dallas ain't no Superbowl faceoff 
We form like niggas in the yard up north 
with long swords, ready for war, who paid cost 
and take ya life lost, never found again boss 
A job well done, relax, throw back fifths 
of Bacardi Limon, fifteenths of hash get lit 
Fuckin with the fabulous Mobb, yeah you were sick 
Lunatic nigga jump up or got hit 

with max and teks and silencers spit 
Shots whiz past your earlobe and shit 
That's the sound of a nigga who almost felt it 
Got you runnin, dodgin, coverin, shelterin 
Bullets rippin through the fabric of ya shirt, it's meltin it 
You bleed again, we just another nigga dealt with 
Intruder alert! Our house is nothin like the Covenant 
We hold big shit like a bitch hold one in the oven 

Well if it ain't drama, money above broke bitches 
Simple minded niggas, Alpha have it positioned 
That's opposition, wetttin me competition 
Suddenly and outta tha blue and now I see 
by myself, by myself and rollin mad trees 
Paranoid on point and now I see who's who 
This thing was fake ones outta the immediate crew 
Life I take one if you jeopardise my do 

You're small mi-nute, gotta death to deal with aces up 
You overbidded and in the Bridge you go stuck 
This ain't a card game but in perspective it's the same 
Put two and two together, Mobb Deep with one name 
Contain drama like Outbreak, you order drama 
We outtake and then take you out 
Keep it real and throw the fake out 
Raise the stakes up, hit you off from the waste up 

That's how it is and how it is is kinda fucked up 
Butter beats bangin got ya whole clique singin 
on a corner while it's rainin, four pound left cha ears ringin 
Delete those and keep my shit discrete, niggas is trash rhyme 
Totally offbeat and outta sync with they light 
E and J bent tight, niggas slow ya roll 
Ya now ya bleedin tonight for no reason 
want to be max and does get smacked, show no love 
Crush ya team like the bear hug 
The Infamous'll do dirt, dead as smear like mud 

New York new get-it-greens, I feel no pity 
no remorse, takin it to the source of course 
Bare that ass thug real kid, it's only your mask

Cop out feel the blast boom on top boom, boom gat for gat 
And all the rules got the drop on you 
And let the nickel nine pop on you 

Yo, my crew in the front got it locked 
My live niggas in the back got the gats blowin out'cha back 
What the deal, what them tough looks and eye contact

Jury junkie like fuck  I ain't scared to get stuck 
So what's the deal poppy? 
You heard the feds almost got me 
I had the Cuban posse all up in my room and lobby 
Negotiation like an Illuminati network 
Don't catch a body experts and retrospect till the foul connect 
When I lost but back then was my fault 
Now it's time to floss 
Eye For An Eye what's mine is yours 
I need a suite with the flowers 
Complementary at Trump Towers 
Sit at the table we can build for hours 
On gettin' riches, a cinch, take a glimpse 
The World Is Yours written all over the blimps 
Here's a toast to my foes, it's like a whole new beginning 
From ? and prima, loads of women rockin' linen 
I got a plan to blow the Hiroshima, Japan 
Movin niggas out the hood and just divide em with fam 
Hey yo, the bitches like G Money said to us, man 
About the dick like the horse with the cowboy brand 

Give it up fast, quick and not slow 
Not goin' to the tables if it's not about dough 
Son you know Mobb Deep is runnin' this shit 
QBC, nigga grab your click 

Yeah son, I'm feelin' it 
Opposition want me dead, concealin' shit 
Four gats got me livin', kid 
Rushin' through my pyramid 
You secondary, go against the grain then you adversary 
Had to bury niggas on my side, that snitch 
Ran his mouth like a bitch 
Now he's layin' in a ditch 
Daily dug for himself 
On his grave I had to piss 
Scud missile never miss you 
Hit you, scratch you off, we left Jim Star rip through 
You metal deeper, you ain't havin' it me either 
It's drama, ain't got time for no breathers 
Rapper Noyd make these niggas into believers 

Huh, huh 
Hey Noyd, what up this cat right here, man 
Word up! 

The tough guy strong me 
I guess he got plans to ruin me 
He want to do me slowly but surely 
I beat his fast ass a bit early 
Grabbed the biased raid, the shit was curly 
Put the drome to his dome 
Let him know it's never early 
You can slide before I snatch the heat from his side 
Saw the devil in disguise by the look in his eyes 
He was surprised I snatched him up 
Regulated his gat and backed him up 
Stepped to the side, P blast em up 

Hey yo, cannons are rough 
You got strucked up, ya strokes slit 
So rapper nigga playin' thug try to pro shit 
(Yo, kill that nigga, man!) 
All I remember was I shot for his throat G 
You see big guns and 3-D is haunting 
It gets deep, fuckin' with these Chi-nese 
Thai weed burnin' my hip from hot thats 
Burnin' my lips from roach clips 
Catch me on 40th and Bootlegger in the a.m. 
These are-tape meridiam cats, insomniacs 
Four in the mornin' we throwin' back some Cognac juice 
Lettin' thats loose in the blue van blitz-through 
These kids too couldn't find the pistol 
Hey yo, I got the Lexus, holdin' my necklace 
I'm bent off some next shit 
Gasoline wick, a kerosene twist 
Stumblin', place of my gun right, it's slipped down its caliber 
Lookin' for chicks that he can stab now 
Numbed up for my fiery cup 
I held juice of sin's nectar 
Saints found they youth 
Mega-action, bitches all around ready to fuck 
Big asses, you bought all the shit, pressin' ya luck 
My pipe games like a night train 
Top speed through ya warm piece

Give up the pussy fast, quick and not slow 
Not goin' to the cell if it ain't a freak show 
Said you know Mobb Deep is plannin this shit

Here come the vultures; the Mobb-laced potent rap shit.
Perhaps, kid, make it happen; start the flippin'.
You fuckin' comic, who you kidding?
My nigga's laughing, blood bathin'; the world's greatest.
In-famous, crime-zanous;
To interfere would be dangerous.
Plane descent; stand clear; save your strength.
You couldn't do the limp if you was coked up.
By my z'd up, whatever the fuck; who gives a fuck?  You get fucked.
My coalition specialises in collision.
The clash of the cliques; the duel o' the iron mac; spit
And leave ya half-split.
You'll be missin' much more than a fraction
When it's time for action.
Hit 'em while a man down; make that nigga backspin.
Trapped up; a madman.
We blastin', you're collapsin'; heavily light, my gold Mac 10. 
Get imprisoned with dem raps; they have you relapsin'.
You get castin' the Mobb, deaf and assin'. 
We face splashin'; dope fake's ice-pick stabbin'.
He slow leakin', he 'ternally bleedin' for speakin'.
Outta place niggas get placed back, indecent.
Live at the main event may I present,
Screamin' out loud for any squad that's deaf.
My infamous Mobb; ya heart throb; hold ya breath.
It's KO from dead arm; rights and hard lefts.
Another satisfied consumer who got blessed.
Single out ya army til; there's no man left.

[Chorus]
Man down. (Man down, down, down, down...) 
Man down. (Man down, down, down, down...) 
Man down. (Man down, down, down, down...) 
Lay the fuck down!

Infamous cartel; visible evidence.
We scarred well; associated team benevolent.
Never hesitant; opposition get settled here with
Sharp shit that'll rip through.
One hundred layers of Kevlar; sharp like the gym star.
Exiled, son, he get sent far;
He's the foulest; QBC gat bust the loudest.
Below profile; peep style; thirsty prowlest.
Catchin' court cases; pay for your legal aid.
Son, that's money wasted; I ain't got time for that.
Invest third place on my best sold rap,
On the scrap from the ignorant cats.
It'll be dead in a few... just like that.
Couldn't bust his gat right.  (Yo, y'know what?) 
But now you bucked your own man, amateur ass.
Homeboy, take that ass to class.
But you cut in, duckin' a reality blast.
You catch a D minus, fuckin' with New York's finest.
The conversation from them outsiders,
Dick riders, connivers, bomb ya camp.
We know survivors; push you off guard; got homicidin'.
We analysin'; tell you up front ain't no surprises.
We take you down first round; give ya man pound.

[Chorus]

[Big Noyd]
Check it out, Dun, them niggas ain't ones
To be blowin' off the top and shit; I'm tired of shit.
Dun, I'm about to dot the bitch and leave him stiff.
Toss me the fifth so I can bless the God with gift.
Yo. nigga Noyd, what's the topic?  Yo, the topic is this:
Let me start from the beginning, at the top of the list. 
First of all, them tight niggas with that space-down shit;
I stick a rocket up in they ass and give 'em a lift.
My marvellous Mobb is tonic, intoxicant, bee-swee.
Morphine raps; you get dope from inner mind-see.
Shit fienin', now get your fix 'cause you need it.
Fuckin' up your intravenous; the Infamous Mobb, top secret.
The only way you weakin' is if you beakin' this.
Sneak devy niggas, mischievous.
'Knowledgin'; the God behind the scene on some snake shit.
The vultures, water from their mouth, but we can taste it.
We just waitin' with patience.
Yo, dun, check the cross-examination; these niggas fakin'.
So you can scream, you can fiend, you can dream for the bacon,
Or you can snatch the Mac for the faggot, ai! 
Bang 'em up, fuck em up.

Mobb Deep,"Yo nahmsayin?
Yeah she'll take you out too kid
Take this shit out

A rainy day laid up thinkin' sittin' gettin' bent
Watchin' old seventy flicks, mind's on the slouch
Back on the couch, heard the phone ring
It was a shorty from uptown I met back day, long time no hear from
No doubt long time no see
I heard you had a seed a baby girl and now she three
Whats up wit that cat, you know who your baby pops
Slung rocks up top then heard he got knocked
He home? Fuck dat nigga I'm on my own
Matter fact got my own crib, plus I'm all alone
Word? The bitch is bad; chill son she got me tempted
Reminiscing the fatty, jumped in the ride I rented
Fresh Timbs, Mecca dice well presented
Sippin E & J straight, was bent when I entered
Gave her a hug, stared her straight into her mug
She ain't she's a bitch, she back then and now its bugged
Turned the VCR on, ""Friday,"" my favorite flick
Its hard for me to drink Alize (no doubt) I take a sip
Got into convo, how you been over the years?
Neglected, stressed out, and living in fear
Whatchu mean, I thought you left that cat which was true
I'm not talkin about him, another dude
Been wit him for a year and had a baby by him (word?)
Matter fact you saw him, downstairs you walked by him
Now thinks it's a setup, could it be or maybe not
She said dont sweat it he dont got the top lock
Tried to play it cool, but in my head shorty's wildin
Using me to get the next nigga jealous called up the fellas
Ty Nitty line was busy so I beeped Gotti, Gotti was
With Trip and two other grimees, The Twinz
Let me begin then explain
I'm at this bitch crib and I think she got me framed
Stuck without a gat, now prepared for combat
Gave the address, told my son there's more cats
Be here in a second, big gats no half steppin
They flippin on me talkin bout I never learn my lesson
I laughed an additional hit them with the math
Hung up the jack, while shorty soaked in the bath
Played the living room, dozed off for a second
When I woke up shorty was standing ass naked
Make moves, all this bullshit pussy better be good
Stepped to the room, threw off my Champion hood, slow motion
All arm bent off the potion
Shorty went down and had a nigga wide open
It was over laid up in the cut
I heard a thump, jumped up threw on my boxers
Yo, what the fuck? All of a sudden
I saw this black motherfucker with this big ass gat
And two other motherfuckers with black masks (what the fuck?)
Clutching duct tape no escape
Tied me up, smacked me all in my face
Shorty wasn't even screamin', looked up saw 'em schemin'
""Yeah, yeah, we got this nigga now, we got this""
All bloodied up, shook the fuck up
Held for ransom, they yelled, ""We got the bones!""
Smiled, then started dancin'
The phone rung it was my son, let them know they had me hostage
Threw me on the phone said, ""Son don't worry son, we got this""
Regardless what the outcome, of this bullshit
Take a nigga word - don't never go see a bitch, word",More Trife Life

Vague memory of last night now it's all dawnin
Look down and see dry blood all on my garment
It stained all my Guess farmer's, colored enormous
I hopped up, outta my bed holdin my head
Flashbacks of gun shots shot past my head
I can recall an eight man brawl three men fall
Bullets flew I had to drug my man behind a wall
Left a wet trail, delivered these slugs like air mail
Directly at the cat that made my man blood spill
An eye for an eye you know my science of life
Is you man or mice thugs or the cowardly type
I kick the 98 shit for your ears to list

Can't take all my dogs getting lost in the fog

Never to return I guess they heard God's call
And nature don't surprise me now
Prepare for the worst and never believe the silver line clouds
Scrutinize crowds my surroundings
Get suspect we start four-poundin' shit
Picture me up in the mix

Yo, if I sat at wrote a verse for all the niggaz I hated 
Most definitely, if not you, kill somebody belated 
Sound foul with a subject, dunn, no women or kids 
Dump you up under a bridge in a cardboard box 
I'm like nothin to do wit it, believe it or not 
I'm washin my hands to get bent with Henney or rock 
Up in the rep bangin my chest off, pealin my socks 
Niggaz do it to death, I sleep with my six cocked 

Like Henney rock, one sip, ya love it a lot 
While you sleepin, I'm creapin wit the intricate plot 
'Cause picture me up in the morgue, way before my time 
Picture you tryin to get my while I'm still tryin to get mines 
Asshole, have ya brain lookin like Castro

I observe the dread, winter time, big shot in my leg 
Blood barrels, a big thick Benneton keg 
Razor glass full, salute all teflon, shoot wit the left arm 
We sleepin wit nukes, the blood is shed warm 
High-voltage guns, nuns wit jums in the gums 
Razors, lazers, bulletproof blazers 
Yo, remind what the team chanted 
They bought the jewel from a don wit a king-sized hat on, slanted 

Kangol wit Bentol, ya mental, mid-war 
Spill Hen' in the store, that's for the own' 
Blaze wit a bent four, yo these laws is your's 
When we pour gasoline all in ya pours and draws 
So decievin, flow speed change, lay him down, empty breathin 
Instead of these leaks, we leave the weak weapin 
Operation, apparatus, spray shots through ya grey Stratus 
Straight up status for maggots

I got an arson for niggaz tryin to figure me out 
You ain't a killa, you just talk more, runnin ya mouth 
The type of nigga, we'll stomp out and bloody down 

Look, we a Mobb for real, don't let the LP's twist it 
Cut me a cheque 'cause I don't talk business 
Drop anthems worth millions and spend millions 
Take trips with my niggaz to the Keys on the weekends

Read your last rites God, forgive me 
For the sin I'm about to commit takin a life
Kill or be killed, rather that than somebody else
Readin my will you feel what I feel, you know the deal
Keep the infrared next to my bed, one in the head
Hearin noises, dead tired, eyes bloodshot red
Sleep with half closed eyelids

Some say it's strange, sometimes that's how strange life get
Go easy on the bottle, niggaz love to see when
Niggaz slippin off point, on the strength they bet
Scopin your ice, appraisin it like the Diamond District Jeweler
With they hand on the biscuit
Do ya, want to get caught lifted; or sober, so you can react quick?
Blow you off the atlas as if I caught you fuckin my wife
On my thousand dollar mattress

If it's beef, poke him with the fork, make sure he's done well

Keep it moving that's how we do it (c'mon, c'mon Dunn)
Been through more drama than the Baldwins, you still crawlin

Rap author, made millions off of melodic, hypnotic productions 
That'll fuck with your conscience and touch your emotions

You feel me?  I'll write a graphic page
Escort niggaz to they grave, relate to the projects
We the black Mobb, it gets deeper than rap music

It's more real than any words I can muster
Pull the black Cadillac trucks up  (what)
Hop out them shits like what?  Y'all niggaz can't touch us

Silk shirts on my chest show what a flirt
Halle Berry blew a kiss at the Barbara Streisand concert
Silk pants colored pink, gators match gangster musical thing
And I'll front like my doo doo don't stink
Instinct like Cuba Gooding steppin out the latest toy
Hazard lights blinkin, gators hit the floor
Everybody watch the red carpet entrance, cameras flashin
Just to think, that was yesterday's action
'Cause today goes either way we came a long way

From hallway steps and hand-me-down shit
Fuck my foes, I seen the other side, NexTel cell roam
Call the chopper phone, heliport in my home
Quincy Jones posters
Wake up, guns under my pillow, I can't talk around chauffeurs
Shit is better than a novel, autobiographic
Spit it on tracks, it becomes classic
Start some, make my heart pump, spark one, I'm God son
Nastradamus, last one to blast one when the NARC's come
Know how to leave anything in thirty seconds
When you feel the heat, comin and flee with the murder weapon
I'll release one, shot you deceased, learn your lesson
Your flesh turn to maggots, bastards, you past it
Cremate your flesh to ashes

With that weak ass bitch damn right she snitch 
And if I had in my misdt she'd be biting shit

While shorty got bent spittin tha latest gossip 
Didn't want to hear it in the middle cut her off 
Lit a stog, smacked her ass, grabbed her by the draws 
Bugged in the head but her looks turned me on 
She tried to turn me on with edible thongs 
Plus I like the way she sounded when repeatin my songs 
From Queens to get to her crib didn't take long

Said she had a man but was locked up in Attica 
Freak off with the VCR to my camera 
After that shit that happened to Tupac
Yell rape? Show 'em the tape just playin my part
Opposed to being on tape but the G that I ran 
Had her tongue in my ear and my dick in her hand

Bring her to the lowest level and shared it with my mans

Infamous till the name wear out
Time and again without doubt, I take the murder-one route
While clowns pulled out and copped out
Poppin' they little heads out they hole
Stickin' they chest out, actin' like they in control
But hold up, I've been doin this since we was kids
And all you other niggas gotta ask if you could live
Your projects is on our dicks, you need to quit
And let us rep that for them, your raps ain't shit
Your background's incorrect, your song push no effect
On the people, don't try to play my part
Don't try to say my words that I lived and survived
Y'all niggas got some nerve, be careful at night
You might bump into a true-to-life nigga like Pee
Get beat over your head wit gun handles
Check the manual you went about it all wrong
We put you on the life, taught you how to drink right
And how to speak like a nigga livin' street life
How to chase down liquor wit more liquor
As a youth I was over-proof, now I'm sober than your hoa
But still pound on a nigga till he throw up
Straighten up, there's too much to lose
Get your head on right, we got the world to gain
And I'mma take mines while you sit around and complain
And I innovate raps while your song is playin'
Looks, tastes and feels to me like no frills
Take that bullshit back to the two-inch reel
Hit the studio hard, crash the track board like a smashed car
Then maybe next rhyme you could fuck wit the god
Pee wit a capital P
And don't ever in your life try to rock wit me
On no days there's no rap page I can't top, I
Splash the half-ass trash you dropped
You get chopped in half, your little raff ain't last long

Leaving foul powder stuck in your lungs
We come from where niggas look out for they dun-duns
Love never disrespect hit shit to re-direct

For street niggas livin with they lives on the line
For young guns comin' up during these times
For police that find drugs let niggas slide
For niggas out slinging like 4 in the night
For your mans not snitchin' when the pressure is tight
For pistols that don't jam when it's time to strike
For bootleg liquor on a Sunday night
This be the realest shit you heard in your life.

Never prejudge
It be the humble that squeeze slugs
It be the ones standin' still that'll peel guns
Spill blood for my duns thuggin' for me
Man you don't wanna get involved fuckin' with Pee
I spent more nights illin' less nights chillin'
The more shots they hold the better they feel it
What be the dealizz
Some killas like to hide behind specs
Others got blatant disrespectin' the rest
Or so young that you wouldn't even expect
To be burstin' off guns like a vietnam vet
On the steps
Sittin' in the staircase bent
Thinkin' on ways to take another man's head
Go to war with niggas that's against what I rep
I settle things with a heavy metal fifth
Change clips
Switch clothes after I spit
Put niggas back in they place for shit that's on the mind kid

For street niggas livin with they lives on the line
For young guns comin' up during these times
For police that find drugs let niggas slide
For niggas out slinging like four in the night
For your mans not snitchin' when the pressure is tight
For pistols that don't jam when it's time to strike
For bootleg liquor on a Sunday night

Mobb Deep,"First of all, we the one and only Infamous
Everybody want to use the name soundin' all lame
We come up in the party with them shanks and things
Have you curled up on the floor feelin' the pain
And nine times out ten we ain't even start the shit
We finish it then they want to press charges
Plus everybody and their mother want to act tough
Till they discover how fast  a nigga leave them under white covers 

Was a thumper till he met the forty thunder
Now I feel strange when I walk by his mother
It's fucked up that's how the ball bounce
The cookie crumbles
That's what the guns do dead you
On the humble, but god fogive me niggas tryin to hit me
What I'm supposed to do you talk about my life 
And a nigga got a lot to loose
So I tuck the heaters then proceed to move
We a mob for real, you an example

[Chorus]
You should spread love not war
'Cause my shit is poppin
And I'd be god damned if you shot me 
You need to spread love not war
'Cause you won't feel safe
Comin out your crib, knowin that we got beef
You should spread love not war
Just think about your kids
How they need you alive for they're guidance
You need to spread love not war
'Cause death hurts whole families 
Imagine it's your  moms that grieves

Two in the neck, yes you will, 
if you not feelin me yet outta respect
Can't stand it man, you niggas is set
Sweatin hard ain't do shit, but run your list
When a nigga get confronted 
All he do is take the fifth
Not the long, talk about the four
Niggas is raw you ain't know, now you know
Leakin down on the floor
Never a need for my words 
Believe what you heard
Never flash a gat and go bust it
That shit is absurd cause I be right back 
To my brother say word you got to drive, no doubt 
I cock it bein tougher for herbs
'Cause the plot is power and I do it for hours
Won't save me for a minute
Till I move on you cowards
Direct drama to us
Infamous be the ones and we rowdy
Million dollar ballad make an album, get classes

[Chorus]

Look around your surrounded by the M-O-B-D-E-E-P
Infamous niggas rep Queensbridge housing P's
My dunns come through with the big long chains
Plus we got bullets, to blow your brains
Niggas learn when they feel the pain
Know what I'm sayin? Straight like that
Standin ovation with max, we clap niggas for less
Splash niggas for laughs shift the game
Raise your odds
I need 93 thousand for 16 bars
Put out the movie, the hoods rush the stores
700 thousand from out the doors
We the most thorough
Need I say more?
The hoes love the morgue
Cause we so raw
Handcuff you whore
When P come through the scene
Glowin like a black light on white clothing

[Chorus: x2]

You should spread love not war
'Cause my shit is poppin 
And I'd be god damned if you shot me
You need to spread love not war
'Cause I don't give a fuck (echoing)
You should spread love not war",Spread Love
Mobb Deep,"It's kinda bugged how I go sometimes 
Know they staring brain feels like a wheel lost with out the ball bearing 
Stuck contemplating on who I can trust 
But like lleullo in a bill my feelings just get crushed 
But that's why I stick with my duns like I stick with the guns 
Don't get mad rip your hun concentrate on my funds 
Lift heavy gats concealed by my waist 
Never get patted down when I step in the place 

Jiggied up, smoke the pot, confirm if it is real reefer or not 
Rally up, after this get followed straight to the crib 
Gem Star, double edge apply pressure 
Shave em down, blow marks right through your mecca 
want to be a thug, now you got the thug look, 
Stick em up, leave medicaid, with the real to push 
God body, with a rubber grip black shotti 
Pump one in his ass make that nigga switch hobbies 

A dossage, hand delivered, without postage 
Bring it to your door step quick on short notice 
Niggas get sniped like, Klonker Brockite 
Show em how to rock right, when bitches hold the mic, street life 

Why you have to raise me this way, You showed me how to survive the 
concrete, If I survive only time can say, You where a part of me

Why you have to raise me this way, You showed me how to survive the 
concrete, If I survive only time can say, You where a part of me

This is something you feel nigga, like the theme song from Hill Street Blues 
This is real, this is ill street news 
How he gone, and left his moms mind struck 
Now his brother ain't giving a fuck 
Little sister giving up the butt now, Dun don't wet that 
I want you to rest black, cause you better belive Noyd gon handle that 
'Cause when I get em, I'm gonna have em 
Pull out the sweeper, and spray it at them 

I ain't no killer, you know me 
But I'll be damned if I don't lie for my C-O-D 
And then this Old G, scold me and told me coldly 
You keep it up and you will be dead like your homey 
But I gotta redeem, get this cream by any means 
I never been clean 
Nigga, my whole click got dirty 
From the battles, to the trials and bloody up shirtsleeves 
Nigga you heard me, its gangsta 

Vision the canvas I paint a picture 
Similar to Ernies Barnes nigga 
But mines is more ghetto more guns more drugs, mostly thugs 
All my duns, their baby moms daughter and sons 
Dark blocks, with streets lamps shot the fuck out 
Park benches broke, a nigga stretched out 
Jumped off the roof to his death its real 
Hand Ball walls displayed with are I-P murials 
Those who sling, play the shadows by the building 
Devils spring, keep em going while the snows blowing 

Grams get dipped, 50's are moked, cookies are broke 
And spliced in large pieces for the fiends to smoke 
The sun set looks beautiful over the projects 
What a shame, its ain't the same where we stand at 
If you look close you can see the bricks chipped off 
Sometimes niggas miss when they lick off don't get clipped off 
Street life 

Why you have to raise me this way, You showed me how to survive the 
concrete, If I survive only time can say, You where a part of me

Considered mad real, niggas feel the Montana shit
Born official, my niggas that are gone I miss you
I shed a tear, see ya'll niggas when I get there
Yo my dun did six years and still didn't hit the strip
I'm waiting on the day, when Rikers Island ciphers are incomplete
When I can sleep with no heat, hidden beneath the sheet
And I can relax with my air max, appearing on my feet
When I rhyme you enter my mind, Seeing nigga's lead to excellence
I represented then manifested in the beat....Respect this
Like a Lexus jeep

Leaves my enemies stretched for weeks, vexed from me
Especially they know my destiny, man they scared to death of me

Charged with a ten body for a nigga get shot

It's a first time for everything, settin you free
And I feel you your man ain't lettin' you breathe
You a dime from your face to your navel
Your man better wake the fuck up and let you out of that stable
Used to think like that until I thought
? shoe on the other foot and I got ?
Stay home, cook and clean like she the boss
Hell no nigga, not while I'm up in New York
She gonna do what she want, flirt when she want, fuck who she want

With bleach in the crib, all my clothes got doused

This man? Where we headed for the future man. What's the resolution?

Wealth, health, and happiness nigga
Keep me from runnin' 'round clappin' these niggas
Sometimes you gotta just handle your business
Fuck it, it's on me, rounds of shots for niggas
Punk, I wake up everyday to cathedral cielings
Jumpin' out my bed, wall to wall marble and pillars
Livin' like the Pharaoh Tut, I'm blessed with life
So I breathe deep and give praise to the most high
Then I, get fresh for a new day
I eat broccoli for breakfast and smoke my trees
Turn on the flat screen to see-Span
See the elite strength, attorney general slowly gettin' bills passed
Prophecies comin' to pass
We gotta survive this shit dun, it's nothin' to laugh at
I hops in the V, grabs the heat and I stash that
I'm in tune with Doc, Pac, and Huey, it's a rap.

I traveled the world, and been a lot of places
Believe me dog, ain't nothin' like home
And if you want somethin' done, you gotta do it yourself, you got drama?
Who's gonna clap that chrome?
Nobody like you, somebody like me
When death I'm ready for it in Threes
And me off point? see'mon now nigga please
I'm paranoid, you know I'm burnin' those trees

Saw a lot of niggas die, some niggas survived
And those that did did it by the skin of their hide
Dodgin' that long ride, the four-fifth aimed at 'em
And knew to fall back when them slugs came at 'em
On the real, for me to be here tellin' ya'll this
Is like dice, then I rolled that Four-Five-Six
And never lost ever since, though I took that big pinch
My Brother passed away, 24/7 I was bent
Drunk in my pain, a lot of friends went and then came
And those that stayed understood a nigga pain
And for a niggas problems had no one to point the blame
I was my own worst enemy goin' against the grain
Somewhere along the line them pieces had to get grabbed
All this money plus family, shit wasn't that bad
All you little shorties runnin' 'round like shits sweet
Just remember these words from the M-O-double-B.

I traveled the world, and been a lot of places
Believe me dog, ain't nothin' like home
And if you want somethin' done, you gotta do it yourself, you got drama?

When death I'm ready for it in Threes
And me off point? see'mon now nigga please
I'm paranoid, you know I'm burnin' those trees

I kiss my finger, cross my heart, I'ma make it out these dark days
Whether together or we part ways
I got a promise to that boy tatted on my arm
Three strong, man, the heat's still lukewarm
Who can you trust when your friends want to pop your safe?
You let him stash in your place, now you watch his waist
Vision the days, hear the ghost whisper
Dogs we left in the past, brought back now here with us
Cross my heart, let the haze linger
Pour out a little liquor, knowin' God took a good nigga
Thousand dollar slippers skirt from the scene he was just a worker, dog,
You were his every dream
I kissed his face like I never knew 'em
It was me, once upon a time when life was ruined
Now the mink rope chain sparklin'
Jumpin' out of bed, Thousand dollar slippers slidin' huggin' the
Carpets.

Ain't it amazin I'll stretch how we keep bangin
We got thousands to spend on them drinks gangsta

We come through, blow shit up, America's
nightmares right here live in the flesh
Our blood and bone be sittin in Ferraris and better
We out in L.A. we drive our own cars, they not renters
And take flights back home to hop up in some next shit
While you tryin to get your hand on some cash
We never gotta touch money again, we got plas-tic

I'm on loadin nines up, ridin up, shootin it
I'm hotter than the corner on the ave out in Newark
I'm grimy, you find me where the loot is with Lugers
The bodies, the hotties, the hustlers and the shooters
With dudes that'll cut ya, that's what eatin your food is
Fools know the rules pull out your tools better buck it
Cause niggaz be flaggin and braggin when they cut up your nugget
Knee deep in the grind like ""fuck it""

Yeah, say it (say it) uh-huh
I'm the illest

Yeah, yo




I gotta be a ill nigga, with no denyin
How the FUCK I get this crowd movin without even tryin?
Made it out the projects, against all odds


Went from, ridin these trains to coppin expensive cars


And even so, all this shit don't make me better than y'all
It only means that I work harder than the average nigga
Never sat around for handouts, I watched and observed


Then quickly rubbed my eyes, if my vision got blurred


I coulda sold drugs (yea yea) 'til I got bagged and jailed
Out of sight, out of mind, niggaz locked feel me like braille

(Feel me) While everybody was chillin

I was broke like a motherfucker, loyal to my vision


Knowin that I'd be on top or somewhere close to it
Nigga, my livin quarters'll be the thing to prove it!

And vowed once I got there to never ever lose it

Let my, head get big and slack off on my music

I'm the illest!



[Chorus: Havoc]

""We done seen it all, done been through it all yo"" -> Prodigy

I'm the illest

""Let y'all niggaz know right now, word to mother f'real"" -> P

No doubt, cause I'm the illest

""We done seen it all, done been through it all yo""

Cause I'm the illest

""Let y'all niggaz know right now, word to mother f'real f'real""

You know I..

Come through with that seven-four pound I
Voice activated, know these whities just hate it


Thinkin I'm a drug dealer, how else could he cake it?

BITCH, my shit legit, plus I invested in stocks

So if this rap dough stop (yea) the show won't stop (uh-uh)

Believe me there's more ways than a few to make it pop (word)


You gotta have it in you, bring it out once it's needed (yea)
I won't stop 'til I'm famous, hostin shows with Regis (that's right)
Be strategic, live it shit it and breathe it


It's my world, my game won't be defeated

(C'mon, give it to me give it to me)

Keep them checks comin, thoughts flowin

Words blowin, hoes goin, Havoc always holdin

First one to fuck in back of the Porsche truck

Lord knows how many babies that chick coughed up


If you asked my enemies they would say it was all luck

That's why you see, mixed emotion when my name's brought up
Cause I'm the illest



[Chorus]




[Havoc]
Yo, you know you ill when you can kill two birds (yea)
With one stone alone and slowly emerge


From the deep depths of jealousy and envy's domain
Make chips then stash for the days it rain


Never cry and survive the pain (that's right)

Though shit looked impossible, to an, eye untrained

Nothin to lose, and know the game, be proud of yourself

Remind yourself, say it to yourself, say it

A villain on the vinyl an analog outlaw
A lot of gats on your DAT taped southpaw
You thuggin when the mics plugged in
Barkin through the speakers like you got no sense
You're wild on the 2 inch
Got your platinum plaques to prove it
Your music's been around the world movin
And it come right back around to the ground on it
Now its time to face your opponent

Stuck where we started at
Fuck that
Not because I have to we want to
I love this shit
The raw is what I live for
To hear the sound of the crowd roar for more
To see the niggas that can't pay rush the door
Wildin on the dance floor when they song come on
Swinging they fists
Ready for war but its a different type of effect
Its not violence
They're just tranced by the advance
Tranqued by the sound bank
Put under the drum

Now who you rocking with them or us

QB or bust

Yet you keep choppin cause there's paper to make
You never felt the power of invincibility

You never hustle
Lets get it right my nigga wild woulda stuck you
Stop dry snitchin in your rhymes listen
What you tryin to do help the guys in blue

You a parasite you never had a life
So you throw other niggas lives in your pad at night

And lose appetites when you taste nigga's steel

Yeah, uh-huh (""What can I do?"")
Yeah yeah (What's goin on man?)
(The fuck is goin on man?)
Yo {""What can I do?""}

To make that paper was the trait that I received at birth
Niggas jealous and hatin' on me (""What can I do?"")
When they plottin' and schemin' on me, the hammer just keep it on me
Fuck the fame and glory (""What can I do?"")
When your shorty gets nasty and horny, she all over me kid
You locked down, doin' a bid (""What can I do?"")
With a nigga, tryin' to take food off of my plate
And you know I got a kid (""What can I do?"")
When my stomach touchin', ribs showin'
You off in the corner glowin' (""What can I do?"")
Nothin' else, but to take what's yours, convert it to mines
From the cash to the shine (""What can I do?"")
When shit is so fucked up, can't tell wrong from right
Right from wrong (""What can I do?"")
When they say, life is short, to you it's the cash
Today it's seemin' long (""What can I do?"")
Now I try to keep a positive look, my motto to jux
But can't seem to stay focused (""What can I do?"")
They say, an unoccupied mind's the devil's playground
So I sat and wrote this, to kill time (""What can I do?"")

[Prodigy]
Yeah yeah that's that gangsta shit son
I feel you my nigga (that's right that's right) (""What can I do?"")
(Infamous baby you ain't know?) We goin' do it like this
(That Mobb shit nigga) (""What can I do?"")

But send niggas to hell
They try and stop me from cashin' in man (""What can I do?"")
But squeeze without thinkin', flip without warnin'
I got the drop on 'em (""What can I do?"")
You know, give it my best, empty this clip
And if live and happen to snitch (""What can I do?"")
Except, find his home, bring it to his family
Should I shoot his moms? (""What can I do?"")
Fuck it, send him a warnin', lick that bitch
Let him know the shit is on (""What can I do?"")
It's not my fault, it's just the game we in
And when you violate codes (""What can I do?"")
But punish niggas for they actions
My shit jam when I start blastin', no (""What can I do?"")
Just relax, take out the clip, fix that shit
Put the clip back and keep goin' (""What can I do?"")
Man you gotta keep your thug showin'
People take kindness for weakness and so (""What can I do?"")
But be a cold-hearted bastard
This world is fucked up, and that's how it go (""What can I do?"")

(Fuck that son, Infamous nigga) (""What can I do?"")
(For two-thousands baby, why yall niggas got your own) (""What can I do?"")
(Your little run, your little five year run ten year run)
(Y'all niggas small time baby) (""What can I do?"")
(Small time baby, beneath us baby)

Mobb Deep,"[Chorus]
Yo, if you make a lotta cream and don't share them stacks
Yeah, it ain't where you from, it's where you at
I know a lotta niggas that'll tear your back
It ain't where you from, kid, it's where you at
Listen, if you goin out of town and don't bear them gats
It ain't where you from, kid, it's where you at
If you caught up in a beef and you scared to clap
Dogs, it ain't where you from, it's where you at

Shit, thug listen (What up baby?)
Ain't nothin' 'round here but drug addiction
Niggas is anti-love-livin
The slug-givin' little shortie on the snub itchin'
For beef, he might get left in the street with his blood drippin'
The poor niggas sling crack, real raw niggas that bang gats
Crazy lady jumped on the train tracks
Know if you owe somebody dough you better bring that
Them kids is live, put five where your brain at
You walk the streets of the slums
Know to spot beef when it come
Reach for the guns or feel the heat from the ones
Never know who your killer be (Yeah, speak to no one)
Just put a Desert Eagle beak in his lung
Leak em and run, some guys light the blunts up
(And then what?) And then go ride with the pumps up
Chopped up bitch inside of a dumpster
Paramedics tryin' to speed a nigga pulse up
(Yo, he's a cold blue) victim of the vultures
Block sizzlin' hot, flooded in the middle with cops
Innocent nigga topped, riddled with shots
Kids up in rock spots clock knots, fiddle with glocks
Ready to die for what little they got
Tricks, hoes and thugs (That's right)
The ones that put holes in mugs
Waitin' outside for them ones that pose in clubs
To that strange nigga knockin' on your do' with gloves
Let the .44 blow for grub, it's no love

[Chorus]

You got uniformed cops, the D's when it's hot
TNT knockin' down the door of your spot
The feds come get you once you think you on top
They just been buildin' they case, they got you on tape
The CIA clip you if the shit is that deep
Your money's that long, you ain't that strong
Informants'll bury you under the jail
They got wires and statements for juries to hear
Then they got rivals that got it clickin' just like you
That's your competition, them niggas tryin to eat too
They'll set you up for dead if you don't show strength
Extort all your workers cause you ain't built for this
Plus stick-up kids and jealous-ass niggas
You gotta watch your front, sides and your back (Damn)
You gotta keep your eyes on your bitch and your mens
You gotta keep your mind sharp livin' so fed

[Chorus x2]",Where You At?
Mobb Deep,"Yeah, Amerikaz mothafuckin' Nightmare, bitch

They wanna know, where the hood at? Nigga, we right here
Live in the flesh with the Tecs, they never scared
Them guns we holding, claustrophobic, we'll let 'em air
Dump-dump, reloaded the Amerikaz Nightmare

Dogs, I think smarter, reach harder
Slugs travel much farther
Niggas stomped a Timberland wearing face carver
With the box cutter, top gutter
I hover over you lames, run for cover, end in your brain
Yeah, you did your thang but not very good
And by the looks of things, You can't come back to the hood
This is not a good look for you my nigga
Wus really poppin, Inquirin minds wanna know
How you rocking them new guns, we cop those
Invoke, like we bought 'em in Costco's
Don't get yaself murk'd, wet shirt
Said it first, hurry this that red alert
You ain't gotta get buck to know that this letter hurt
The sight of my hammer, gotcha heart pumping
Nerves twitching, eyes jumping, heads will roll
When the pound starts kicking You be missing
Moms will be wearing that yellow ribbon
While I'm somewhere in the Carribean Islands, chillin

[Hook]

You know we keep them big thangs
That make dead people when we hit brains
It's a wrap for the sequel get yo whip spray'd
Tho I rather hit you walkin, get yo shit shaved
Plus showered up, talkin then we split, hey
Won't catch me gun smokin, have the cops think
There was drugs that provoke it while we rollin, hey
Baby girl, I see you, can I get a taste
Of that thang, heard it's lethal in a good way
Just so you kno I ain't the one that get yo clit ate
But hope you got a strong back, I'll make yo shit break
You'll be walking like a penguin for a few days
Yo Bitch, you know we got BIG CASH
Money fallin' out our pockets, give you whiplash
When we drive past your project, ain't nobody can stop us
Infamous they can't stop us, They want our spot
Yo fall back nigga we got this

I got love for my niggas, love for my niggas
Love for my niggas, got love for my niggas

You know shat stay on my hip, you know the hood that I rep
You know we dumpin' them clips
You in the valley of death

That's that hard shit
That hit a nigga up in his car shit, this war bitch
Somehow I feel we need more of the thing
Instinct to get that paper, know it's all in my vein
You rookies need to be toilet trained
You faggots shittin' everywhere that you eatin'
That's why the coroner came
You never know, when the tec'll blow
Wet you and catch you off guard
Niggas know that I crept slow
And never fold bitch, hollows we let 'em go
And hope them little jugs you sold cover your medical
y'all don't want to bump heads with us
Dump lead head to head with us (nah)

Don't confuse our album with that ""Mix Tape"" shit
Those our scratch, basically our throwaway shit
And nobody wrap the street like the Infamous clique
Slash Jive, now we got millions to work with
And we Violators too, so you know we overdoin' it
What's stoppin the crew, only death can ruin it (bring it)
Homey been there and done that, and still they want to come back
and shoot us down (blaow blaow blaow)
Our advice, you want somethin' done right
then you better come and do it yourself
We give shooters this shits, make O.G.'s get they gun off the shelf
And blow the dust off they old snub-nose three pound
Dump dump dump

Shoot 'em up now bang, bang
Don't fuck around with the wrong mayne
In every fuckin city it's the same thang
Don't be sayin nothin stupid to a grown mayne

I'm bout the money, I been at it for a little while
Never put the metal down
Hunger never satisfy, billion dollar Snicker bar
And once I settle down, pre-nup to the lucky broad

A Bentley Coupe, a bless in the backseat
First day, once they hand over them keys
Couple of G's, I'm trickin' on the watermelon trees
So high, so stuck, like Jay's Rucker team

On the bus no diss f'real stuck
Just countin' that, money and still visit my niggaz on the Island
The money mountain I climb it, it won't stop
My money too dirty to ever go pop
It's a lot, you could do with a fifty ( )watch
Steadily, eliminate, competition and flood
That block with the primo, 'cause the trunkilo 
Not for too long, gotta stay on top of your people

I got the mac in my pants

It always come a time, when it's time to flip

You only flippin' when you hit by a gun of mines
You broke and you want to shine, you in a dollar van
I'm in a oh-five G-55
That girl you with's a friend of mine, I hope that's not yo' wife
You wouldn't do that if you seen the bitch other side

We ain't got time for peasants, the streets need our presence
They not gettin' fed from them other guys
We in the hood like drugs, if we ain't out on tour
With Mobb Deep written on the headline
While y'all poppin' all that lip
We does what y'all talk and more of that kid
Unfold one of my knots, it look like a brick
We'll never go broke, while you sit and bitch

Dumped off the bridge, body mopped the fuck up
When them Mobb Deep boys creep or pop the fuck up

'Fore I show you what the .9 or three-eighty like
Want beef muh'fucker come and get me

Puffin my haze, missed with that dro and sprinkled some hash
How I roll? Why would you ask?

I know y'all roll with the boys with the badge
That's why when you kick that gangsta rap, homie I just laugh
From the ave, where snitches get blast
They say, no Noyd, you won't blow makin songs like that
I say, homie you sell your soul to glitter, it don't last
I don't get no bigger, I'ma keep it realer to death
Fuck is a check if you ain't bustin a tec
Nigga we countin the scrilla with the gun on the deck
Countin the gang that snaps, think how many straps and vests
We flash the pound around and knuckle down the rest
We hate the E-mails and the phones, the spots get blown

Ya playin' games to the sound of them guns fire
Cereal and powdered milk, that was then then
A-1 Sauce sandwiches, we was children
Growing up broke, snatching chains and coats
Smokin' weed with coke, sellin' fiends soap
Drunk sleepin' on the bench, I couldn't make it upstairs
Woke up and seen the kids on they way to school, shit
Borrow money for my drug dealing friends
So I can buy beer, yeah that'll put me on my feet again

It all happens in the hood, it never seems to stop
And even the good ones, get drugs planted by them dirty cops

Back to back, niggaz be gettin' shot
You would think that they would learn from they first time being popped
From the hospital, straight back to the block

Hanging with the honies is the song I sing
Real niggas do real things
On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
Busting my toast off the roof drinking ninety proof til spring
Real niggas do real things, check

We started out making, small time bacon
Two little niggas baking, talking bout whipping cakes
Get clothing and big cheddar, hoping it gets better
We had no knowledge of this shit we just was with whatever
In front of your building clocking, thought I was making a killing
Right in front of your children, eight ball in my side pocket
They was corrupt too, disrespecting the fiends I used to
Look up to, take it or leave it, fuck you
In different parts of the planet, Oakland to New York
I'm hollering Lifetimes, he hollering Life's Too $hort
Parallel lives and jewels held high
To the Range, to the Rove, get exchanged, for your souls
You know how the game goes, slang to get G's
And speak in Chinese everybody gains the same dough
Get your shit scarred fucking with my sick squad
From Marcy, to the Bay y'all, we get large, keep in charge

So now you own a record label, I got one too
We on a roll now, can't nobody stop our crew
You can treat us like convicts, you know we got records
On the shelf and on the charts the double deckers
The fat donkey house down the block, belongs to me
You criticize the way I walk, you wanna see my bankbook?
I'm not a crook, I flipped the script and changed my ways
So I can get paid, everyday
I see the same old shit, I see in the streets
I know you think I'm selling keys but I only sell beats
Dope fiend music, it's drug related
You can buy it on the corner get a radio and play it
It always sounds better when you turn it up loud
Rap music let these motherfuckers know what we about
I know these gay ass record labels keep fucking niggas
It's just like in the streets main, how much you get?

[Chorus]

That's right, I been a hustler for a long time
Always got the right beats, never saying wrong rhymes
I started off with nothing ended up with everything
Now we sip Hennessy in first class on every plane
Ask Jay-Z, he know what I'm saying
Always see me at the bank and yes I'm going again
There ain't no dollar amount, that can make me happy
Fine women, a big house, a truck and a Caddy

Now peep, how sweet, niggas lives can get
Put beef aside, the East and Westside connect
Short Dawg, and Jigga with the, fo'-fo' flow
I got love for y'all motherfuckers y'all just don't know
I know y'all got a thing for them rag six-fo's
I like the five speed drops pop the clutch then go
If you want it, keep balling, and if you jealous stop
I want Biggie to rest in peace, as well as 'Pac
How real is that?

For cars not fashion, my whips be the bomb
My clothes, be the same shit that we had on
And fuck looking cute, save that for the broad

It's the H-A-V-O-C, dump and reload
Knock-knock, answer that, I'm blasting through the peephole
Body charges, pay lawyers so we beat those
But get locked and I'm slutting lady C.O.'s

And we the only niggas you know, that fuck they P.O.'s
They push our files to the top, you still on parole
We got, money to roll, no time for penitentiaries
Too much dollars to fold, it's bulging out our jeans

But losing ain't a option girl
My destination is top of the world, top of the world

Y'all like bitches, the chit-chattering
Stay not liking a nigga but giving dap to him
Hav' don't change for no chick, and they adapt to him
Never get cool with you niggas, I end up clapping 'em

Federal note fetish, you fuck with my niggas
Franklin and Grant, get your ass blammed with the quickness
Y'all niggas is finished, you overdosing the world
With that cute shit, it's time for this realness

And here I go again, letting the mac blow
Slugs bubble up in your stomach like lactose
I'mma date shorty, put it up in her backbone, for real
Put it on her like a track I rapped on, for real

Know what? We outlive labels, and distributors
We run laps around every artist on your payroll
Then hop up in a Range Rov', jet black with the black rims
Killing your bitch in her a-hole, uh-oh!

But losing ain't a option girl
My destination is top of the world, top of the world",Win or Lose
Mobb Deep,"I'm tired of this shit
I'm tired of these silly ass games
I can't even look at you no more
And I don't think you'll ever understand
Until you get a dose of your own
It's your turn now

Crazy how I never use to say a single word
I just held in all the hurt, all this hurt
And I was so afraid you might flip out
And leave me in the cold
Then my mind ran out of space
So many stories I'm told

How would you feel
If I put my girls before the one I love
How would it feel
If every time you want to talk
I turn the TV on
How would you feel
If when we're making love
I don't go down no more
So you know how I feel
Get ready cause a 3-6-0's about to go down

Taste this
And let's see if you can handle it
Just one sip
You probably choke on your own medicine
Taste that
Once you swallow then I got you trapped

No more running
No more hiding
And if you try
I'm still gon find ya
And get you back
Get you back

Listenin' to my conversations
On the other phone
Got somebody followin' me
When I leave out our home
And I am so appalled
You take it there
When you're the one who messed up
It's like I'm sleepin' with the enemy

How would you like it
If your girlfriend started playin' F.B.I
And she was the one
You forgave when she messed up
And spread her thighs
Plays with his brain
Started foolin' with ya money
Your house
Your Bens
Your friends
Your work
Let's see how you like it
And take a little taste
Taste of your own dirt

I'm sleeping with the enemy (Yeah)
He doesn't know just what's in store
So they call me a silent storm
And soon he'll feel all my of pain
I'll come for sun after the rain (Oh)
ain't nothin' sweeter than revenge
To put this bullshit to an end
Let's see what happens when I get a Lex
Mmm mmm mmm mmm
Lets see what happens if I quit my job
Oh
Let's see how you feel when I don't call back
You can't take it

No more running
No more hiding
Cause I'm crazy
I'm a find you
And get you back
Get you back

You not a man
If I gotta tell you how to treat me (Oh)
And I'm not a woman
If I don't stand up in what I believe in
Taste that
50/50's it's suppose to be
But less than 25 is what you gave me

No more running
No more hiding (Yep)
And if ya try
I'm still goin' find ya (See, I'm a find you)
And get you back

Yeah
You hurt me
You hurt me so bad

Mobb Deep,"It seems like, ever since a nigga became multi
Every women on planet Earth got their eyes
On the kid, they all wanna touch
On a nigga skin, they love me so much
They all got P on they brain
And at the show they do anything to get backstage
Just so they can hug 50, and kiss on Banks
After we all get a turn, the broads said, ""Thanks.""
Shit, just last month a nigga wasn't shit
Now I finger pop dimes, with diamonds on my fists
Niggaz bringing me they girl like, ""You can have my bitch
Just help me get down with the G-unit!""
Man, little groupies, they make me sick
You ain't getting in the after party unless you're a chick
And bitch, you ain't getting in the hotel, unless we grip
And you're gonna look fine, plus suck a mean dick (woah)

Shorty, hit me high then hit me low
You get around girl, I know I seen your face before
Turn around, yeah I know, I recognize that ass
You was at the last show with your backstage pass

Shorty, hit me high then hit me low
You get around girl, I know I seen your face before
Turn around, yeah I know, I recognize that ass
You was at the last show with your backstage pass

Shorty what's up? You know you wanna roll with a nigga
I'm trying to fuck, if you decide to go with a nigga
I'll tear it up, in the tele you'll be loving a nigga
I'll work that, work that. yeah, I'll work that, work that

It's funny how a bitch'll make her way backstage
Harder than the politician on the campaign
No games baby girl, gotta do the damn thing
Let me see you back it up till you pull a hamstring
Face fuck, girl go for broke
So hard, leave stretch marks up in her throat
Then Havoc on the floor
I don't need to get her number, she'll be at the next show
Half-ass dress, smelling like sex
Dried up nut on her neck
They don't call us the massacre tour for nothing
We destroy good girls, send them home, pussy sore from fucking
Catch 'em in the morning in somebody White-T
And that's the kind of bitch that you call wifey
She'll do it anywhere from the tele to the tour bus
Here's the hot line bitch, call us

Shorty, hit me high then hit me low
You get around girl, I know I seen your face before
Turn around, yeah I know, I recognize that ass
You was at the last show with your backstage pass

Shorty, hit me high then hit me low
You get around girl, I know I seen your face before

Shoppin' sprees at the diamond dealer

We sceamin', daydreamin' of penthouses in L.A.
The illest yachts, the hottest broads they make
Can't wait 'til it's my turn to get dough
So I don't gotta fuckin' day dream no more

Coming up we ain't have much, a lot of canned food
Cereal in the white box with powdered milk too
My moms couldn't buy me the shoes I want
We put lay-away on shit that only cost a few bucks

It's cool to have shelto, I had the libeaz
With the weak ass Velcro, looking ridiculous
I knew way back then we had to step it up
'Cause waiting for the bus in the snow wasn't us

Me and hav' took the train from Manhattan to Conney
Everyday and night just so we can got songs done
We had guns, weed and a couple of forties
If we got lucky on the way, we could jook someone

We used to watch video music box
And pray maybe one day we could get a shot
Outside, my niggaz had all that shit you see on T.V.
From money that they made off the block

A vigil, bullet proof cars, supped up time shares
My friends did a turn 'cause it's not they turn
Or how the streets gonna be when they release fur

When I get that million bucks will I remain the same?
Or will I have to get at niggaz 'cause they sayin' I changed?
Will everybody wanna ball, be my friend and leech?
When niggaz put me to the test, have me clapping the heat

I used to think bein' rich, ain't all that bad
A far cry from what a dream was all I had
Do I got the right team or they riding for cash
Would they jump in front of me when them cameras flash

Is the 'pop police, gon' be up my ass
Can't leave the heat under the seat, gotta find a better stash
Gotta collect receipts 'cause that bitch uncle Sam
Invades your space when you evade his tax

Sold drugs to put you all alone with this purse
Took a backseat, 'cause family came first
Holes in my sneakers and shirt

I turned 13, now lil' niggaz sellin' coke
50 4 1l's yea I copped 'em for them hoes
But you left without warning, I guess it was a lesson
I had you but you showed me no affection

Got withdrawals, took you to the malls
The more I got of you, the more I got spoiled
Now my toes curl, let's have a baby boy or girl
Had you in Switzerland, half across the world

Grew up an investment and you can't be doubled
Came back around when I bubbled
Now I'm in trouble, took the wrong turn
Let my homie borrow you, now he won't pick up his phone

Where you goin', baby, where you goin'?
Talk about money this is money, baby, where you goin'?
I can hold you baby, I can hold you let me hold you

The thing about you is you make me smile
You build me up when I go down
You give me strength, you give me power
May no one come between this thing of ours

The thing about you is you make me smile
You build me up when I go down

May no one come between this thing of ours

You give me sex, you give me gifts
You give me head from every baddest bitch
You make me happy, you make me sick

If I ain't have you how would I live
To get you I'd risk that time in prison
To get you I'd take risks that'd mean death
I'ma love you until the end, it's all about you my precious

I'd never ignore you for a bitch again
I'd put that on my honest
Got these other nigga jealous 'cause you all over me
In public, you be all inside my jeans

Took me all over the planet, places like Europe
Taught me new tricks at them banks out in Zurich
These niggaz, back in the hood
Could never have you like how I do

The thing about you is you make me smile
You build me up when I go down
You give me strength, you give me power
May no one come between this thing of ours

The thing about you is you make me smile

Guess one man's trash is the next man's jewel

This is no way to live
(It's alright)
But it's just the way it is
(It's alright)

You got to understand
(It's alright)
That I never could trust a man
(It's alright)

But I got to let it go
(It's alright)
And stop livin' in the past
(It's alright)

(It's alright)
And give you a chance
(It's alright)
Give you a chance

When we first middle sex fif, knew that you was that chick
Wooly sayin' holla at her, whip sayin' girl get in
Remind me of a women that, I can have without the stress
Asked if she had a man, couldn't tell if no or yes

Hell, I just dipped her number and talked more
When I hit you one conversation, I knew that she had trust issues
Who the hell would do that, man cheated on her twice
Last one before that, found out homie had a wife

Looked so secure, but yet so delicate
Can't come back in the crib without a search for evidence
Baby girl, I ain't here to hurt you, here to protect and serve you
Ain't your fool model them other dudes don't deserve you

What you tryin' to do, scare me off and leave you low
Funny how you let it ring and never answer your phone
The accuser got me curious, I asked who it was
He like the 'Sold-a-soul' man, who the fuck you 'cause? I'm out

This is no way to live
(It's alright)
But it's just the way it is
(It's alright)

You got to understand
(It's alright)
That I never could trust a man
(It's alright)

But I got to let it go
(It's alright)
And stop livin' in the past
(It's alright)

(It's alright)
And give you a chance
(It's alright)
Give you a chance

Every time I hurt you it's because of what someone else
Has done to me and I know it's not really fair
No I just can't trust you 'cause I just got outta something
And I'm running, boy you know that I'm running scared

You treat me so good that it's just too good to be true
And I don't think that I really deserve
To be treated like a woman should
'cause I been so hurt in the past I'm still carryin' bags

This is no way to live
(It's alright)
But it's just the way it is
(It's alright)

You got to understand
(It's alright)
That I never could trust a man
(It's alright)

But I got to let it go
(It's alright)
And stop livin' in the past
(It's alright)

(It's alright)
And give you a chance
(It's alright)
Give you a chance

We can ball to the fullest baby
(It's alright, it's alright)
You can style if you want, go ahead stunt
(It's alright, it's alright)
If it's diamonds you like go ahead pick 'em up
(It's alright, it's alright)
Get the first Bentley spurs His & Hers
(It's alright, it's alright)

Now blend in with me, as I proceed to break it down

With the drink till the burn is gone,

Before it pop, make me sign a disclaimer

Try to get me on some pop shit these chicks will frame ya
But, in any event, keep fuckin with 50 it make cents
Cents, into them dollars, the hoes want to holla
But you lookin at a nigga that done came from the squalla

In the club feed them liquor of the wise I'm starvin
So much green gettin twisted like Botanical Garden, let's go

Mobb Deep,"Yeah

Homey, if I go to Hell and you make it to Heaven
Just get me to the gate, and I'll talk my way in
Got a gift, I'm special with the flow I'm good
Shit, I done talk my way out of the hood

Now if you followed my footsteps and walked through my shoes
You wouldn't go against me cause you know you would lose
It's been along time comin' I done paid my dues
Now every time I turn around it's like I'm back in the news

I know a lot of niggaz want me wearin' cement shoes
And Uncle Tom niggaz wanna see me locked up to
Around the same time KRS was writin' Black Cop
I was busy tryin' to pump cracks in the black blocks

Poppin' shit to my homeys about how my gat pop
Got rid of that chrome thing and got back a black glock
P ninety hold ten but I had six shots
I used to walk around with it and risk gettin' knocked

I bought a fresh box of bullets from Old Man Sam
Wanted to shoot a nigga so bad it was itchin' my hand
Some shot it out with me, and some of them ran
And some of them dashed were good and some of them jammed

Homey, if I go to Hell and you make it to Heaven
Just get me to the gate, and I'll talk my way in
Got a gift, I'm special with the flow I'm good
Shit, I done talk my way out of the hood

Homey, if I go to Hell and you make it to Heaven
Just get me to the gate, and I'll talk my way in
Got a gift, I'm special with the flow I'm good
Shit, I done talk my way out of the hood

Now if you take a good look and look into my face
And if they wouldn't even dare to violate my space
Som' I did so much dirt, I'm tryin' to clean my slate
And ate so many niggaz food and now they want mines ate

The dogs bark when I walk and since the souls I took
Moms pray for me with her right hand on the good book
Saw shots fly by me, no, I shouldn't been trippin'
The Pulp Fiction must have been God's divine intervention

Wouldn't thought then from that, I learned my lesson
And clean my act up and go straight to perfection
Uncle La got knocked the feds hit it with seven
And left me with the fifty cal and a mac eleven

Start everything from everything from heads to the worries
And had half the hood damn near wanted to mirk us
Found myself askin' God what the fuck is my purpose
You go to heaven, know I'm foul but put a good word in

Homey, if I go to Hell and you make it to Heaven
Just get me to the gate, and I'll talk my way in
Got a gift, I'm special with the flow I'm good
Shit, I done talk my way out of the hood

Homey, if I go to Hell and you make it to Heaven
Just get me to the gate, and I'll talk my way in
Got a gift, I'm special with the flow I'm good
Shit, I done talk my way out of the hood

Now homey if I go to Hell and you make it to the pearly gates
Tell the boss man we got beef
And tell his only son, I'm a see him when I see him
And when I see him, I'm a beat him like a movie

For leavin' us out to dry on straight poverty
For not showin' me no signs they watchin' over me
Yo! We a new breed in two thousand six
We don't give a fuck about that religious bullshit

Nigga show me where the cash at
The nice whips with the three car garage to fit them shits
Man my life is painful, pray to angels
I'm prayin' to myself hopin', I ain't got to spank you

My bullets shank you, and when my guns start cuttin'
Ain't nobody gon' save you
In the bible times, they ain't had to deal with the shit
We dealin' within, these survival times

Homey, if I go to Hell and you make it to Heaven
Just get me to the gate, and I'll talk my way in
Got a gift, I'm special with the flow I'm good
Shit, I done talk my way out of the hood

Homey, if I go to Hell and you make it to Heaven
Just get me to the gate, and I'll talk my way in
Got a gift, I'm special with the flow I'm good
Shit, I done talk my way out of the hood

Slide through with your own risk
Chain gat on the train with your low bitch
Tears drop cause death is a tear jerker
Whether shot or strapped up to a steel gurder

All this foul shit I did they should have took me, smokie

'fore you move on it, put jewels on it, who want it
Loose niggas make the news when we start formin'

I'm a thorough street nigga for real, you just applaud me
Avoid P, man take your baby mom's advice
I'm nothing sweet, ill with the guns, you pay the price
When you see me in the streets soldier, salute me
You just a groupie, oh you gangsta, then shoot me
Who gives a fuck really, I miss my nigga Twin, kill me
So I can join the rest of my falls, up in the heavens
You rap niggas make me laugh, y'all crazy ass

We takin what's yours we do jooks rush the doors
Here come the deez tryin to make breeze and guns toss
In full force, my team'll go at your main source
We're not tourists, hit bosses and take hostage
Your whole setup, from the ground up we lock shit
Blood flood your eye, fuck up your optics
Switch to killer instincts for niggaz pop shit
Yo nigga Noyd what's the topic? Nine pound we rocked in
Ninety-six strike back with more hot shit
Illuminate my team'll glow like, radiation
With no time for patient, or complication
Let's get it done right, my click airtight
Trapped in a never ending gunfight so niggaz lose stripes
or lose life, jail niggaz sendin kites to the street
Over some beef that wasn't fully cooked, finish em off
Well done meat, that said twenty-two slug to your head

Never hesitant, it's the rap game unlimited
Summon rasta we can do this, forever infinite
Then reminesce, twenty years later how we was gettin it
Either with me go against the grain you better hit me
Leggin me or robbin me niggaz better body me
Cause it's a small world and niggaz, talkin like bitches
Bitches singin like snitches, pointin you out in pictures
Cause she rep the QBC faithfully, playa hatin me
All that bullshit, is just makin me
More the better, then concentrate on gettin chedda
If shorty set you up you better dead her, I told you
Shape and mold you, Sun you, then I hold you
Like a pimp mind control you double edge blow you

To simplify shit, no man can go against me
Test me you must be bent G, don't tempt me
I had this full clip for so long, it needs to empty
The reason why it full for so long, cause I don't waste shit
You probably hid, blood in your mouth, so you could taste it
Quiet as kept, I lay back and watch the world spin
I hear thugs, claimin that they gonna rob the Mobb
When they see us, I tell you what black, here's the issue
It's a package deal, you rob me, you take these missles
along with that, I ain't your average cat
Fuck rap, I'm tryin to make CREAM and that's that
Whatever it takes however it gots to go down
Four mikes on stage a motherfuckin four pound
Speakers leakin out sound and niggaz leakin on the ground
I could truely care less the God will get his
Regardless blow for blow let's find out who wear hardest
This rap artist used to be a stickup artist
Sometimes I test myself see if I still got it
A live nigga stay on point never diss

We come through the spot real heavy on the waist
So when they wanna move, we put 'em in they place

Yo, I was schooled by the hood, raised by the wolves
Trained by the pain, adopted by guerrillas
Gotta tank for a car, ice for a arm
Got tattoos wit skin and scars from brawls

Got a buildin' for a crib, Manhattan for a backyard
Skyscraper ladies, they fuck me when they man gone
Kings of New York, I'm one of the few of those
Difficulties to come, it's gon' be funerals

You get a quiet spot in the shade, for a grave
I get paid 'cause I got murder 'fore sixteen
And I'm so much rich, I got a condo for a piggy bank
So much stash, I just laugh at your face

Blow a stack on David 'cause I'ma pyro
Maniac from carriage, wit' the Rolls Gold

Hustled by the bus stop, aged to the front stop
Block party departed, somebody got bodied
Right before I snatch this little number from my hottie

Yeah, young dude wit jewels and barrel lens
Heavy bones on the deuce, flickin' it up in the mix
Fast forward to O6, gettin' head in the O6
Have a chick, feelin' like she workin' out on that Bow-Flex

I'm focused, looked through my lens, see my vision
Surprise myself and came through without one spool missin'
From that hallway kissin', there was room in the Carlton
I can smell it in the air, P in that next room sparkin'

Me, I let that heady flow, meet me at the tele' hoe
You don't do the tele', oh, fuck it bitch you gotta go

Stare too long, fuck around, turn into stone
My ruga like medusa and my goons like drones
Hover over battlefields like we in a warzone
E.T. niggas get shook, want to phone home
Trying to use a lifeline but nobody got the manses
Big guns, pulling out them M.C. Hammer dances
No time to get caught the judge throwing books
Like niggas read, we just know about the jooks
Clipped L's in my ashtray

There's no need to grab her arm like that, stop resisting
You're fighting, wasting all our time, you embarrassing
Your own self, look at you now
Stretched out staring up at the twilight, security bound
You took my cavalier attitude for being a bluff
I took your woman, she gave me gratitude in the truck
She want this legendary dick in her life, I got that glow

If rap was prison our shit would be the Supermax
No sunshine, just dark skies
Nothing but dark thoughts going through my mind
I got bad blood, mad love only for the team though
Everyone one of us is the shooter, now where the beef go
I ain't seen none of these niggas and we out here
Wanna be celebrity thugs a lot of mouth, yeah
Oh my god we could not be fucked with
Real shit look at our life all in the public
We under the microscope they all watching us
We have no choice but to keep it trill they sizing us
And if they wasn't god, always pay attention don't he
I couldn't live with myself being phony
Look, if life was a game then I guess we winning
'Cause this life we made for ourselves is bitching

Didn't want to do it but the voices tug and pullin'
On my eardrums something that I knew I shouldn't
Got me wildin with the ratchet out like shit is legal
Looking for a victim put 'em in the fetal
Fuck is going on? when it's on I know it's on
But shit not really popping and I'm looking for a war
Looking out my window pointing shit at police
To make matters worse I'm sipping on some OE
Shit got me buzzing, I'm already bugging though
With mad [???] bottles that I drank about a month ago
Fuck is on my mind? I'm feeling bipolar
Plus paranoid looking over both shoulders
I woke up with blood on my hands
Fuck I do this time? now a nigga scared
Fuck, I'll probably get the fucking chair
Grab my fucking gun, a few clothes son I'm outta here",Dirt

So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together son your beef is mines

[Chorus:]
Verse One: Prodigy
Let me start from the beginning, at the top of the list
KnowhatI'mean? Have a situation like this
Another war story from a thirsty young hustler
Won't trust ya, I'd rather bust ya, and leave your corpse
for the cops to discover, while I be dippin in the Range Rover
All jeweled like Liberace
You watch me while Jakes tryin to knock me and lock me
But I'll be on the low sippin Asti Spumante
Niggaz try to creep on the side of my jeep
Stuck the heat through the window rocked they ass to sleep
Over a 3-pack, it was a small thing really yeah
but keep lettin them small things slide and be a failure
If I'm out of town one of my crew'll take care of ya
The world is ours and your team's inferior
You want to bust caps I get, all up in your area
Kidnap your children make the situation scarier
Life is a gamble, we scramble for money
I might crack a smile but ain't a damn thing funny
I'm caught up in the dirt where your hands get muddy
Plus the outcome turns out to be lovely
Got G's in my pocket hit off my main squeeze
Push back, the sunroof, let the cold air breeze
through the butter soft leather upholestry
But mostly, keep the gat closely, 'cause niggaz want to toast me

[Verse Two: Havoc]
Yo I gotta get mines, no matter what the con-sequences
Count up my blessings, add up my weapons
Cock back the gat and let my nine serve purpose

Roll the custom built shit, I bust them clips
Niggas trust my lips, while they suck they dicks
Plus the Kiss be the Long Goodnight
Murderous bitch be the wrong in spiked-typed, what
Price right, be that song, the right type
But only if Havoc and P spittin' wit' me
And they say they gon' see that C.B. nice wit' it
Hinnesy and Rimmy, and give me some Ice wit' it
Shake down, niggas'll throw some dice in it
Put your Money on Chuck or in 9-9, you're fucked
Try your luck, stress this red-head
I mix blood in my dye, like my family ties

Yo, when I foul out on lab mouse
One nut and I'm out
Ain't tryin' to stick around, let a nigga catch me out of bound
Don't give a fuck about a rumor
Know how I get down
Let my man's do it, he gots to right to it
Known Jay come through the door, still like they ""Who this?""
Don't got beef, but got niggas, serious ones
Make sure a nigga here, plus lasted wars
And stay countin' all that cash when I'm fuckin' wit' 'Un'
Fuck around with my funds, got a bring a gun
Please don't make me have to puncture ya lungs

Cause we the ones rockin' 'em, the ones toppin' 'em
Gold bars unpredictable, like Mr. Cal' shockin' 'em

Yo, all and together we gon' rush the front door
Get at them

Infamous, my niggas pop clips to this
And fight to it
Niggas respect it, it's like we magnetic
It's like the last thing you want is drama
Go at the girls, have a good time, don't make it a problem
While we pop bottles of Mo'
Burn down bottles of 'dro
Smack that ass of models and ho's
Rappin', all ya'll some rag old bunnies
Ready to jump off
I'm on the side fondlin' this Marcy
Black car be gone, Q.B. bitches ready to brawl
Charli Baltimore payin' dues, got it 'em balled
At the bar slashin' bitches

From a Wayne cell, we stuff back in '96
Spaid like... swallow the Gin, we musclin' in

Even when the stress try to pile up
Paper in my hand give me wild rush
Reminiscing on wild us and rolling the miles up
So [?] I'm never putting the pound up
Let 'em hate, bitch, I built it from ground up
I hold the fort down, nigga, know what?
You could see it in the lives that my sound touched
I make money, take money, my aim hungry
Spit a verse, it ain't nothing short of a green [?]
Bucketlist complete, I did a song with Bun B
And Juicy J, who the fuck fucking with me?
I think nada, lame rappers you make me gog up
The part, depart these niggas like I'm shooting commas
State your business or forever hold your peace
Go 'head with that bullshit, motherfucker, I'm sweet

Got damn, who would've thought it would've been me?
Street legend that came up with a pen, G
16 bars to get me out the ghetto
And I always kept it real with the people, I never settle
There's a lot of folks depending on me to lead 'em the right way
Instead of listening to what the radio might play
Some real game for somebody that did it
We be breaking it all the way down so anybody could get it
And I gotta admit it, the road was buffy
Hand-to-hand combats, sometimes I live lovely
You can't win every fight, but you gotta fight though
Just make sure when you on the side of right, bro
You don't go in thinking you making history
But looking back in retrospect it ain't no mystery
Nobody ain't ever did what we did then
And ain't nobody to do it again, nigga, we legendary

It's not an urban myth, no, we are the truth
If anybody gon' do it know we gon' do
Whole life we grind so hard to stay official
And make them niggas hating back [?] tissue
They shit you 'til they stomach, fuck 'em

Peace to my niece, they ain't never pulled no dumb shit
Peace to the youth, the young soldiers in the street
[?] to the money, they reminding me of me
When you get get that, better keep that, better not let that drop
Cause someone gon' be right there then take your spot
We got our lane mastered, yeah, we got it locked
My haters wanna be blasted, man, they better stop
For shit get good, you could see his guts
And it's too late to serve you, they can't get you mopped

You see these gold chains of slavers, never had that to make payments
Yeah, I came from the basement, but now I vacate in Vegas
I could sell out in your state, nigga, just to make a statement
Nah, nigga, stay high and bitch I'm with is high maintance
Homie, play me if you wanna, I got all my goons on
We gon' catch a body, but you gon' catch a tombstone
You don't got no hustle, you get cut off like coupons
Been about crutons, bro, that's why the roof gone
We still coming up, that's what my dollar say
Ain't about no guap then stop, homie, we can't conversate

Snitch down, all he saw was fire when the lead popped
Permanently on bed rest, Shortie talking marriage
She ain't even give me head yet

Said fuck the world went ahead and just did us
Did us... never looked back in survival

Don't want to leave it, you already know

How the fuck did we let this
Thing get so far gone there's no way we could fix it
Baby boy on the way, if she only knew that's mines
Shit is like a daytime soap or movie on Lifetime
But nah nigga this real life and it hurts
Missing you or lying to her I don't know what make it feel worse
And me putting her first makes me feel like shit
I hate seeing you cry, wipe away your tears
Fuck it I'm a just leave her but what about our kids
Don't want to break their hearts let's wait a few more years
Oh god I swear to god I wish that we could just bounce
Don't even pack no bag just break the fuck out

How can we love when we love
If this love is never supposed to be
Living lies that the truth could see
So now tell me love, can we love
If we know this love can't be this way
Let's keep this love low

My feelings for you got me feeling foul
How we even get here
Feeling funny being in here, my homey used to live here
When he died a part of me died
Seeing you have to suffer
Just wanted to comfort not turn into lovers
That shoulder you could lean on, I know shit got you stressin'
The kids asking for daddy, they keep asking the question
Came around to check up on ya'll, I know my homey do the same
Guilt like a motherfucker, how we get into this thing
That love shit is real, is all that wrong
People looking at us like we crazy
Now we spend nights on the phone all night long
Got so much in common this shit is crazy
It's more than just physical 'cause mentally you stimulate me
And if I ain't up on it baby you just educate me

Nobody asked you where you got your dollar 
They ask you do you have it that idealistic shit won't pay you rent
I don't wanna start philosophizing anyway

Can you blame me I was raised from a cold street, 
Make for a better story what they told me
Sad part this shit is real life, pressure on me nough to break a fuckin steel pipe

Wipe blood on my razor blade, teach niggas how to chill out and make way
When you see me take it easy, best believe me

It makes you sick to hear the mobb bang like this
Infamous for the world to hate or play this
Don't give a fuck if you can't rock to this
My duns' heads bop to this
We stand out like a tourist
And make more noise than them other rap niggas
No gimmicks
Just pure adrenaline
Raw lyrics incredible beats
Don't mean to rub it in
But your small time beneath our feet
Straight ass cheeks niggas be askin
For ass whippings
Guns kick like pelle
My big shit be jumping like Jordan
Often lay a man down on the floor when it gets like that
I'm not blowing off rounds so you can hear sounds
So you can run back actin like you a vet
And swearin' you dead
You survived some real shit
Now what's this it's not going down like this
Ground y'all niggas like punishment
Dumpin' out full clips when we dumb out
Though I'd rather do music and chill the fuck out
Dun you bugged out I'm trying to walk a peaceful route
But niggas always got mouth until that piece come out
Niggas always gonna think something sweet
Until they least expect you bringing action exactly

My shit'll hit while you lettin' niggas go
So you can lower the wrist

Any provoke uprise you ain't got it in you
First of all you too soft for fastball
Point game track y'all merk like a jaguar nascar
And be out buck 80 on the slow mar
Hennesy spillin' all over my radar
Stay charged niggas getting amped off the mobb shit
Have you wildin' out on some club shit
Fit to make you dance at the same time
Stop and glance 
Slap flames out the nigga with the wrong idea
Young shit with young mind but that quite contraire
Young nigga smart nigga
Who started from the stairs 
How dare
You try to come around the way
In fear like a nigga that been there for years
Shout words that we live but don't play with it
'Cause when the shit go down you be like they did it

You's a dime a gross
That's a dozen heast the least
Keep silence the most
Regulate with the rest of my establishment
Blast out the pockets of coke
Make the cops boat
I break down your whole background yo
Irons? permanent flesh your clothes soakin'
You feel the shots pain every heartbeat throbbin'
Don't get excited you'll only make it worse fighting
Spent most of my nights graveyard shifting
Make burial grounds be that man grim reaper

Imma drink away the pain until the brain get numb
Can't take all my dogs getting lost in the fog
Never to return I guess they heard god's call
And nature don't surprise me now
Prepare for the worst and never believe the silver line clouds
Scrutinize crowds
My surroundings
Get suspect we start four-poundin' shit
Picture me up in the mix
With the next man broke and is on my dick
A good man of plenty but an enemy it was clear
I just be another problem that he feenin' to fix
But I can't have that
Pull out I try to grab that

Yo, the lost page of a wild rhyme writin nigga
P holds the pen tightly, explode nightly
I count on one finger all y'all rap niggaz that excite me
Y'all niggaz is trash rap - wanna fight me?
You shook to death, take breaths and step lightly
Y'all Little League niggaz is so bald they might be
spent too much time with wifey, come out to play
with the hard-headed, Infamous song torture
Crack your knuckles, buckle up your pants tight
Pull your hats down, let's get it on like papi bar fights
My spiral book, hold the world's most lethal
There's no cure, for what my pen do neither
Bring the fever, y'all niggaz is the rap Justin's
While we was gone for a moment, y'all kept the crowd goin now
move over bacon, time for som'in meatier
Your shit's weak, your best song was mediocre
Fuck a penis, how dare you entertain the thought
that you could come out to challenge me in blood talk?
Take a walk jerk this ain't Levert, Sweat and Johnny Gill
This is rap for real, somethin you feel
You catch a chill when you hear the Mobb bang through your stereo
It's heavy metal for the black people, rock'n'roll
but it's hip-hop though, my drug music
It's thereapeutic to the user, you slam dance to it

Chorus Two: repeat 2X

Nigga we Infamous, ashes to ashes til death do us
And y'all weak to us
If you stand amongst us, prepare for the worst
It's a must we burst ours first

Yo.. crack the Henny bottle while I drop this jewel on your dome
My shit'll touch home, straight to the core you ain't alone
Play the unknown type Dunn, mysterious stars
Concealin them slugs, if it go down, remember that mug
Cause ain't no love when a nigga shit is touchin his ribs
Hungrier than a hostage, shit, we blitz
in formation pack the led up in shit
The better you get, the better we get, and that's it
Yo this snake's in the grass when they bite Mobb anti-venom
Stop em in they tracks, goin at em when you send em
Imperial dogs, creepin through fog
Carved needle slip and you fold, the shit's lethal
We roll Mobb D-iezel, the whole Q.U. double-E, N-S
And when you spot us, play low-key

[Prodigy]
Dunn these niggaz is actresses, and they tryin to play the man's role
Can't they see us wildin on the video?
Don't they see us in the club swingin elbows?
Or on the street with our jewels on the cell phone?
Hoppin the sidewalk with Benzes and Jeeps
I ran through more cars than it's sand on the beach
I'm pleased to meet you, now here's a word to the smart
Don't ever let your peoples boost up your heart
Cause you'll fuck around and get your ass torn apart
Challengin the Mobb in the arts
Our literature stands collossal, compared to y'alls
Way ahead of your time, you're strugglin to keep up
Your style's limited, your rap's primitive
Go 'head with that bullshit you kicked Dunn

You sail up and over the waves, glistening in the warm sun

The wonders of the mighty sea
Schools of brightly colored fish and banks of coral
All illuminated by the blue light of the underwater sun

And you start to chase them
And suddenly you're caught in a drift net
Laid by commercial fisherman and you start to panic

While you hold mine, I'll come and wait

Everything that I'd owned
I threw it out the windows, came along
Extreme ways I know move apart The colors of my sea
Perfect color me

Extreme ways that help me
That help me out late at night
Extreme places I had gone
But never seen any light
Dirty basements, dirty noise
Dirty places coming through
Extreme worlds alone
Did you ever like it then

I would stand in line for this
There's always room in life for this

Oh baby, oh baby

They helped me down every night
I didn't have much to say
I didn't get above the light
I closed my eyes and closed myself
And closed my world and never opened
Up to anything
That could get me along

I had to close down everything
I had to close down my mind
Too many things to cover me
Too much can make me blind
I've seen so much in so many places
So many heartaches, so many faces
So many dirty things

They told me it's for my hova
My voices on my shoulder
Plan it
Let the vultures divulgin'
To keep revolvin' the spot
Works on my focus
My culture, but no one knows it

This is why you focusin' mostly upon my my own shit.
I told you I'm not the culprit I'm the only one you notice
Walking across the ocean explosives with co-motive I'm hopeless
With out your notice I'm goin' 'til my mind falls

Psychosomatic I don't know what is the matter...
Psychosomatic I don't know what is the matter with me.

Mix it up with the alpha hits
Now me smokey yeah I smoke them trees
Think that we should ever stop from takin' trips
From my Jah to the U.S. strips
Let my country road go everywhere we go
They just adjust there toxin to make it easier-oh
Easy enough, get down the road
Hey there missy

The birds they feed before they take flight
As the weary sun succumbs to their heavy eyelids that is life

Fall into finite space
With the roof torn down

So tired of wandering around and starting over
No garden grows here now just the one leaf clover
And when the windows shuttered
It’s always dark inside
Sometimes the pain is absurd
Still it’s what fate decides
Thought I saw Jesus come down
Dressed like a soldier
I used to cry like a clown
And now I’m older

Here come the lonely night
Can’t escape my mind

And the grinding wheel turns
And the heavens burn
As the pilot ignites is a lesson learned
A sullen look of concern
It might make you sad
Like the fluttering bird in a dream you had

Me hacía temblar 

Fué un cielo lejano
Y una tierra caliente
Un soplo de viento

Que envuelve y que besa
Que acaricia y no pesa
Ni te deja fingir 

Medianoche en mi mente
Desde todos los siglos
Mediodía en tu alma
Que gritaba calor 

Una casa infinita
Y un pedazo de gloria
Así fué nuestra historia
Así fué nuestro amor 

Y una música blanca
Que volaba en la arena
Un volcán en las venas
De placer y dolor

Inutile e fragile e fragile

Di star vicino sempre 
A chi a bisogno e a chi non ha niente
E di capire quelli che ti invidiano ti odiano
E di farmi anche male se è il caso di menare
Di darle pur di prenderle di prenderle
Ma di combatter sempre per orgoglio e dignità, 
Combatterò per dimostrare sempre
Che io non sono un perdente
Con umiltà umiltà e mordente 
Vincerò battaglie e guerre
E mi sentirò grande 
Solo quando la gente che amo potrà vivere dividere
Il premio per aver scommesso su di me

Parlami se vuio
Le mie orecchie sono tutte per te
Ma ricordati che poi quello che cerco si tu lo sai bene cos'è

Modà,"Non voglio più nostalgia
Non voglio più che tu vada via
Così lontano da me
Io non pensavo che fosse così difficile

Ci sono notti in cui non so
Non so proprio con chi parlare
Perchè io parlo solo con te
E quando tutta la città si addormenterà
Camminerò guardando il cielo
Per cercare un tuo riflesso

Volevo dirti che tu
Da quando non ci sei io non vivo più
Volevo dirti che se
Che se non torni allora vengo da
Allora vengo da te

Il non vederti mi provoca
Un'emozione un po' insolita
Qualcosa di inspiegabile che
Che mi costringe a raccontarlo in musica
Pensieri e note che vorrei
Cantare in una di quelle notti
Dove le stelle siamo solo noi due
Perchè l'unica poesia che può piacere a noi
Perchè per noi stare insieme
Sta al di sopra di tutto

Volevo dirti che tu
Da quando non ci sei io non vivo più
Volevo dirti che se
Che se non torni allora vengo da te

Volevo dirti che
Che Ora so bene quel che provo per
Quel che provo per te

Non ti nascondo tutto quello che
Che ora ho voglia di dirti

Volevo dirti che tu

Prese un sentiero che portava 
A una cascata dove l?aria 
Era pura come il cuore di quella 
Fanciulla che cantava 
E se ne stava coi conigli 
I pappagalli verdi e gialli 
Come i petali di quei fiori che 
Portava tra i capelli 
Na na na na na na na na na 

Il cavaliere scese dal suo cavallo bianco 
E piano piano le si avvicinò 
La guardò per un secondo 
Poi le sorrise 
E poi pian piano iniziò a dirle 
Queste dolci parole: 

Vorrei essere il raggio di sole che 
Ogni giorno ti viene a svegliare per 
Farti respirare e farti vivere di me 
Vorrei essere la prima stella che 
Ogni sera vedi brillare perché 
Così i tuoi occhi sanno 
Che ti guardo 
E che sono sempre con te 
Vorrei essere lo specchio che ti parla 
E che a ogni tua domanda 
Ti risponda che al mondo 
Tu sei sempre la più bella 
Na na na na na na na na na 

La principessa lo guardò 
Senza dire parole 
E si lasciò cadere tra le sue braccia 
Il cavaliere la portò con se 
Sul suo cavallo bianco 
E seguendo il vento 
Le cantava intanto 
Questa dolce canzone: 

Vorrei essere il raggio di sole che 
Ogni giorno ti viene a svegliare per 
Farti respirare e farti vivere di me 
Vorrei essere la prima stella che 
Ogni sera vedi brillare perché 
Così i tuoi occhi sanno 
Che ti guardo 
E che sono sempre con te 
Vorrei essere lo specchio che ti parla 
E che a ogni tua domanda 
Ti risponda che al mondo 
Tu sei sempre la più bella

Modà,"Non ti sorprendo più con le mie follie
Con le mie teorieChe per amarsi non per forza serve tanto tempo

Forse neanche qualche giorno
Ma non dimentico neanche l’attimo in cui
Mi hai vista li seduta sola ad aspettarti
Tu te ne stavi li fermo
Con la paura di svegliarti

Guardare insieme a te il sole sciogliersi
E tirar tardi in giro a piedi per le strade liberi
Poi non trovarsi, sentirsi persi
Con la paura di cercarsi
E allora porta via questa malinconia
Devi convincermi che non sei mai andato via
E adesso scaldami in tutti gli angoli
Con la tua pelle ed i tuoi baci e poi guariscimi
Fammi sentire tutta quella voglia che hai di vivermi
E poi cancella dentro me l'incertezza e la paura che ho di perderti
Ed è incredibile se poi ripenso che
Il primo bacio è arrivato come un acquazzone imprevedibile
Ma cosi bello

Come pioggia, pioggia dopo tanto sole
Io che stringevo le tue mani per ore
E ti dicevo che dalle mani sento molte cose
Tu non capivi le mie parole

Qui nella Bassa la terra sta morendo / Con la guerra che è finita da due mesi
La miseria non ti lascia più dormire / I bimbi cercano da mangiare
E più niente, nulla da mangiare / L'unica cosa che see'è rimasta è partire
E cercare un'altra vita via lontano / see'è una terra che ci aspetta giù in Brasile
Terra buona da lavorare / Buona da lavorare

Un saluto agli amici e ai nostri vecchi / Con in gola un gran magone che ti fa singhiozzare
Con il treno che partiva pieno di gente... / Con le valigie e gli occhi chiusi
Con le valigie e i cuori gonfi

Trieste ci aspettava con il suo porto / Col vento che soffiava scendendo dal Nord
Ma erano già tutti partiti per il Brasile / E noi non sapevamo più cosa fare...

Modena City Ramblers,"Non avrai altro Dio all'infuori di me spesso mi hai fatto pensare;
genti diverse venute dall'est dicevano che in fondo era uguale:
credevano ad un altro diverso da te, non mi hanno fatto del male,
credevano ad un altro diverso da te, non mi hanno fatto del male.
Non nominare il nome di Dio, non nominarlo invano.
Con un coltello piantato nel fianco gridai la mia pena ed il suo nome:
ma forse era stanco, forse troppo occupato, non ascoltÃ² il mio dolore;
ma forse era stanco, forse troppo lontano, davvero lo nominai invano.
Onora il padre ed onora la madre, e onora anche il loro bastone:
bacia la mano che ruppe il tuo naso perche' le chiedevi un boccone.
Quando a mio padre si fermo' il cuore, non ho provato dolore,
quando a mio padre si fermo' il cuore, non ho provato dolore.
Ricorda di santificare le feste, facile per noi ladroni,
entrare nei templi che rigurgitano salmi di schiavi e dei loro padroni,
senza finire legati agli altari sgozzati come animali,
senza finire legati agli altari sgozzati come animali.
Il quinto dice ""non devi rubare"", e forse io l'ho rispettato
vuotando in silenzio le tasche gia' gonfie di quelli che avevan rubato:
ma io senza legge rubai in nome mio, quegli altri nel nome di Dio,
ma io senza legge rubai in nome mio, quegli altri nel nome di Dio.
Non commettere atti che non siano puri, cioe' non disperdere il seme...
Feconda una donna ogni volta che l'ami cosi' sarai uomo di fede.
Poi la voglia svanisce ed il figlio rimane e tanti ne uccide la fame.
Io forse ho confuso il piacere e l'amore ma non ho creato dolore.
Il settimo dice ""non ammazzare se del cielo vuoi essere degno"",
guardatela oggi questa legge di Dio tre volte inchiodata nel legno.
Guardate la fine di quel Nazzareno, un ladro non muore di meno!
Guardate la fine di quel Nazzareno, un ladro non muore di meno!
Non dire falsa testimonianza ed aiutali ad uccidere un uomo...
Lo sanno a memoria il diritto Divino, ma scordano sempre il perdono.
Ho spergiurato su Dio e sul mio onore e no non ne provo dolore,
ho spergiurato su Dio e sul mio nome e no non ne provo dolore.
Non desiderare la roba degli altri, non desiderarne la sposa...
Ditelo a quelli, chiedetelo ai pochi che hanno una donna e qualcosa...
Nei letti degli altri gia' caldi d'amore non ho provato dolore.
L'invidia di ieri non e' gia' finita, sta' sera v'invidio la vita.
Ma adesso che viene la sera ed il buio, mi toglie il dolore dagli occhi.
E scivola il sole al di la' delle dune a violentare altre notti:
io nel vedere quest'uomo che muore, madre io provo dolore;
nella pieta' che non cede al rancore, madre ho imparato l'amore",Il Testamento Di Tito

Te pregunto que me pasa
y no sabes qué contestarme
Porque claro, de seguro te mareé

Con mis idas y vueltas, te canse con mi cámara lenta
y aunque trato, nunca puedo, apurar mi decisión

En el preciso momento en que todo va cambiando para mi
En ese instante te aseguro que alguna señal te di
Pero no me escuchaste tal vez sin intención de tu parte
Puede serte un poco débil el sonido de mi voz

Oh! Una mañana te veré llegar
y descubriré que yo, solo ya no estoy mejor
y te pediré que me acompañes
A donde en verdad no sé, dime que si, miénteme

Podría ser que al final, rompiste el cristal en mi
Podría pasar, que me hagas hablar
Yo creo que tienes el don de curar este mal

Siento que debo encontrarte, sin embargo
Paso el tiempo yéndome
Hacia mi mismo, a mi centro, que jamas encontraré
Yo quisiera tenerte, y tratarte de modo decente
Pero ves que ya no puedo despegar de mi papel

Deberé tranquilizarme y jugar al juego que me propones
Bajo la guardia, te recibo y me abrigo de tu piel
El destino me ha dado, corazones desequilibrados
Tu palabra, me nivela y detiene mi caer

Oh! Una mañana te veré llegar
y descubriré que yo, solo ya no estoy mejor
y te pediré que me acompañes
A donde en verdad no se, dime que si, miénteme

Podría ser que al final, rompiste el cristal en mi
Podría pasar, que me hagas hablar
Yo creo que tienes el don de curar este mal

Es un solo, es la guitarra de Lolo

Podría ser que al final, rompiste el cristal en mi

Quebraste el silencio que me hizo alejar
Quizás seas tu quien me hará regresar

Sabes que esto no me hare feliz. (aunque lo entiendas así)

Quedó en el recuerdo

Dejando en mi pecho una herida cruel
Al verte rendida por otra ilusión
De celos y angustia mataste mi amor

I thought of caring
As a reason for some to praise me, in envy
“So humble and kind”
“No better person”
Now that I’m older I’ve seen what I’ve been
Ruthless, ungrateful, always trying to turn up tracks
Be it about me or you

Seeking out the faithful in me
With tricks of trust and gluttony
I don’t wanna wait for anyone

When I was younger I thought of deep space
Pick me up swiftly, carry me away
Drop me off willing, light-years long gone
Never again seeing those who I loved
It’s not about me this time, there I go lying again
Please save my soul
I don’t know what I’m doing anymore
Seeking out the faithful in me with singles and a pen
Is it possible I’m overthinking this?

It’s not what I’m not, it’s what I believe in
It’s not what I’ve got, it’s my peace of mind
Too early to see if I’m still in the past
Too hopeful to be wasted time
It’s not what I’m not, it’s what I believe in
It’s not what I’ve got, it’s my peace of mind
Too early to see if I’ll be

Seeking out the fraud in me
With compassion and honesty, I’ll wait",What If...

opening windows with a wounding cry 
the rainbow's lost its dreams of gold 
and everything slows

rising on a wave of voices

Modern Folk Quartet,"All of these nights that we've been a dating
All of these nights that we've been awaiting
Something tells me that the time is getting right
Each time we kiss it takes a little bit longer
And my love for you gets a little bit stronger
And I feel like I'm-a-sittin' on dynamite
So this could be the night
The night I've waited for
This could be the night
I'm gonna give her all my love and more

When it comes to lovin' she's a natural master
And each night she's there well my heart beats faster
Deep down inside I know the best is yet to come
Oh oh gonna pick her up about a quarter to seven
I know were gonna take a little trip to heaven
And if it's love she wants then I'm gonna give her some
So this could be the night
The night I've waited for

Closing time another day is done
When a boy walks in the door and points a pistol

That he lets the old man run out in the street
Even though he knows they'll come with guns a blazing
Already he can feel that great relief

Bearing both their burdens and their scars
Don't you think they'd love to start all over
And fly like eagles out among the stars

Sees that old familiar anger in their eyes
He knows that when they're shooting at this loser
They'll be aiming at the demons in their lives

In his own a bottle's thrown in anger
And his father cries we'll never live this down

Modern Jazz Sextet,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",Ballad Medley: Old Folks/What's New?/How Deep Is the Ocean?

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere

Love will never hide

Modern Talking,"You packed your things in a carpetbag
Left and never looking back
Rings on your fingers, paint on your toes

But I feel you're the girl for me
Rings on your fingers, paint on your toes
You're leaving town where nobody knows

You can win if you want
If you want it, you will win
On your way you will see that life is more than fantasy
Take my hand, follow me
Oh, you've got a brand new friend for your life

You can win if you want
If you want it you will win
Oh, come on, take a chance for a brand new wild romance
Take my hand for the night
And your feelings will be right, hold me tight

Oh, darkness finds you on your own
Endless highways keep on rolling on
You're miles and miles from your home
But you never want to phone your home
A steady job and a nice young man
Your parents had your future planned

From east to west, love you the most
It's hard to win, you try your best
And we are sure, you'll beat the rest

Who will be the hero
Everybody loves the show

You are the champ, a hurricane
From heaven sent, you win again
Oh tell me where, the hero's gone
But you are here, we can't go wrong
The price is high, when dreams come true
Oh we can fly, it's up to you

Live my life without you and I'm feeling blue
I told you lies, love fades away

It's 5 o'clock a lonely night
And I just remember, we were side by side
I made mistakes, you went away
And now I know the words, I didn't say

How can I fall in love
With a blue eyed coloured baby girl
How can you tell me, we can't be together, oh no

The night is gone, I couldn't sleep
I saw the old videos, I'll always keep
Day in day out, I'm missing you
Is there just a little chance, what I can do?
The night is gone, I watched a star
I have to face the future, oh you're so far
Some lies are true
Can we stay friends
Tell me baby when will I see you again

Modest Mouse,"Well I ain't sure but I've been told
He's baking cakes inside our souls
Stayed awake, took a nap
Got myself my bottles back
I'm breaking down out on the street
Walkin' round my own bare feet

That I'm not a cat

I caught a rat, we caught some air
He's never gonna cut his hair
He takes more time to make a fake

And wash the dirt off our intentions
Paddle on with our bad inventions

I came as advice that came too sure
I came as gold, I came as crap

I don't know but I've been told

Modest Mouse,"We were shootin' at a mound of dirt.
Well nothing was broken, nothing was hurt.
But I probably really should have been at work.
But if my free time's gone, would you promise me this?

That you will please bury me with it?
Please bury me with it!

Well sure as planets come, I know that they end.
And if I'm here when that happens, will you promise me this my friend?

Please bury me with it!
I just don't need none of that Mad Max bullshit.

Well the suit got tight and it split at the seams.
But I kept it out of habit and I kept it really clean.
But if it's getting' faded, if it's runnin' outta thread,
Could you just do this for me my friend?

And please just please bury me with it?
Please bury me with it!

Well we moved to the left and moved to the right.
And sure as hell we stayed out almost every single night.
But if the party's over, if the fun has to end,
Could you do this for me my friend?

Would you just please bury me with it?
Please bury me with it!

Good news for people who love bad news.
We've lost the plot and we just can't choose.
We are hummingbirds who are just not willing to move.
And there's good news for people who love bad news.
We are hummingbirds who've lost the plot and we will not move.
We have good news for anyone who loves bad news.

We were aiming for the moon. We were shooting at the stars.
But the kids were just shooting at the busses and the cars.
So don't drink the water, don't you breathe the air.
If it's gotten to that point then I have to declare:

That you please bury me with it!
Please bury me with it!

Well fads they come and fads they go.
And God I love that rock and roll!
Well the point was fast but it was too blunt to miss.
Life handed us a paycheck, we said, ""We worked harder than this!""

Please bury me with it!
Please bury me with it!

We are hummingbirds who are just not going to move.
And there's good news for people who love bad news.

Modest Mouse,"I backed my car into a cop car the other day
Well, he just drove off - sometimes life's okay
I ran my mouth off a bit too much, ah what did I say?
Well, you just laughed it off and it was all okay

And we'll all float on okay
And we'll all float on okay
And we'll all float on okay
And we'll all float on anyway, well

A fake Jamaican took every last dime with that scam
It was worth it just to learn some sleight of hand
Bad news comes, don't you worry even when it lands
Good news will work it way to all them plans
We both got fired on, exactly, the same day
Well, we'll float on, good news is on the way

And we'll all float on okay
And we'll all float on okay
And we'll all float on okay
And we'll all float on alright

Modest Mouse,"The good times are killing me. 
Here we go! 

Got dirt, got air, got water and I know you can carry on. 
Shrug off shortsighted false excitement and oh what can I say? 
Have one, have twenty more ""one mores"" and oh it does not relent. 

The good times are killing me. 

Kick butt buzz-cut dickheads 
Who didn't like what I said.

Jaws clenched tight we talked all night, 
Oh but what the hell did we say? 
The good times are killing me. 

The good times are killing me. 
The good times are killing me. 

Fed up with all that LSD. 
Need more sleep than coke or methamphetamines. 
Late nights with warm, warm whiskey. 
I guess the good times they were all just killing me. 

Got dirt, got air, got water and I know you can carry on. 
The good times are killing me. 
Enough hair of the dog to make myself an entire rug. 
The good times are killing me. 
Have one, have twenty more ""one mores"" and oh it does not relent. 
The good times are killing me. 
Shit-kicker city slickers who all wanted me dead. 
The good times are killing me. 

Get sucked in and stuck in late nights 
With more folks that I don't know.

In my head, in my heart, in my soul.
And maybe we'll get lucky and we'll both live again.
Well I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Don't think so.

Well that is that and this is this.
You tell me what you want and I'll tell you what you get.
You get away from me. You get away from me.
Collected my belongings and I left the jail.
Well thanks for the time, I needed to think a spell.
I had to think awhile. I had to think awhile.

The ocean breathes salty, won't you carry it in?
In your head, in your mouth, in your soul.
And maybe we'll get lucky and we'll both grow old.
Well I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I hope so.

Well that is that and this is this.
You tell me what you want and I'll tell you what you get.

Well that is that and this is this.
Will you tell me what you saw and I'll tell you what you missed,
when the ocean met the sky. (You missed, you missed)
You missed when time and life shook hands and said goodbye. (You missed)
When the earth folded in on itself. (You missed)
And said ""Good luck, for your sake I hope heaven and hell (You missed, you missed)
are really there, but I wouldn't hold my breath."" (You missed, you missed)
You wasted life, why wouldn't you waste death? (You missed, you missed)
You wasted life, why wouldn't you waste death?

The ocean breathes salty, won't you carry it in?
In your head, in your mouth, in your soul.
The more we move ahead the more we're stuck in rewind.
Well I don't mind. I don't mind. How the hell could I mind?

Well that is that and this is this.
You tell me what you want and I'll tell you what you get.
