Samantha Fox,"Ah, touch me
(This is the night) Ah, touch me

I want to feel your body
Ah
Ah

Full moon in the city and the night was young
I was hungry for love, I was hungry for fun
I was hunting you down, and I was the bait
When I saw you there, I didn't need to hesitate

This is the night
This is the night
This is the time, we've got to get it right
(This is the night)
Touch me, touch me
I want to feel your body
Your heartbeat next to mine
(This is the night)
Touch me, touch me now

Quick as a flash you disappeared into the night
Did I hurt you boy
Didn't I treat you right
You made me feel so good, made me feel myself
Now I'm alone and you're with somebody else

This is the night
This is the night
This is the time, we've got to get it right
(This is the night)
Touch me, touch me
I want to feel your body
Your heartbeat next to mine
(This is the night)
Touch me, touch me now

Touch me, touch me now
Touch me, touch me now

Hot and cold emotion, confusing my brain
I could not decide, between pleasure and pain
Like a tramp in the night, I was begging for you
To treat my body like you wanted to

Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh
Oh, I was begging for you

(This is the night)
Touch me, touch me
I want to feel your body
Your heartbeat next to mine
(This is the night)
'Cause I want your body
All the time

Ah, touch me, touch me, touch me
(This is the night)
Touch me, touch me

I want to feel your body
(This is the night)
I want to feel your body

I take a trip to the oceandrive
Straight up and right into the blue
Whatever it takes to get out alive
My love is coming up for you

Now I'm walking right up at the waterfront
And I'm still looking for a cure
Don't you know it gets hard to relax
When this problem gets pure

Won't you feel my love again
Can't you see my heart's in pain

It goes deeper and deeper
And deeper and deeper
Deeper and deeper
And deeper again

It goes deeper and deeper
And deeper and deeper

Till my love wins
Back your love again

I'm walking the edge of a borderline
Am I walking on real thin ice
Am I getting too close to heaven now
Dreaming gets real

But otherwise
It never rains in wonderland
It never rains at all
So won't you give me the answer now
I'm breaking these walls...
",Deeper
Samantha Fox,"(J. Astrop, S. Fox)

Do you want me baby
Do you want my love?
Do you want me baby
Do you want my love?

So many questions demanding answers
Is the writing on the wall
Do you want me
The way I want you
Do you hold this love up
Or do we let it fall
Forever knowing
You're the one now
Ever growing in my heart
Feel the pressure
That we are under
For this love to fall apart
We should make a start

Do you want me baby
Do you want my love?
Are we taking it for granted
Do we call the whole thing off

If you want me baby
Got to let me know
Do you want me baby
Or do I let you go

It's so peculiar
How emotion takes you higher
Than the furthest star above
When two lovers kiss
Do they wonder
Whether this is infatuation
Or is it really love?

Do you want me baby
Do you want my love?
Are we taking it for granted
Do we call the whole thing off

If you want me baby
Got to let me know
Do you want me baby
Or do I let you go...

I wake up, I wake up
What does it mean to dream
Is it staying alive or to fall or rise
So take it to the limit and lets dream on, dream on

I wake up, to find you
To find you next to me
I reach out, yeah
You're there like a vision of ecstasy

But when I wake up
I realise, I'm holding on to a dream
(don't you know it's just a)
You're just a dream to me
(you're just a dream to me)
A part inside of me
(a part inside of me)

You're just a part of a dream in me
You're a dream in me
I feel cold
As your, as your shadow moves away
I feel heat
Heat now

I need you
I really need you here to stay

You're just a dream to me

What you are inside you
Carry with you always
And everything you do

Will lead you back to me

Whatever you have done
And whatever you may do
Love has made you what you are

No matter where you go
I will always come to you

Baby find a star and any star
Will lead you back to me

People wish for many things
Things they'll never be

Climb the walls of my defences
So, take it nice and slowly

I'll get used to missing you
Make the most of the moment

Sometimes you've gotta leave what you love
To make that love grow strong
There comes a time when a voice inside will tell you where you truly belong.
You search your heart and you will find
The answer has been there all the time

CHORUS
Tonight all my dreams unfold
The hand of love has touched my soul
The longest journey's reached the end of the road
I will never walk alone as my dreams unfold


Goodbye's the hardest word to say
Each and every time
And if I had to leave this sacred place
I would leave my soul behind
You search your heart and you will find
The answer has been there all the time

CHORUS
Tonight - all my dreams unfold
The hand of love has touched my soul
The longest journey's reached the end of the road
I will never walk alone as my dreams unfold


Close your eyes and you'll hear my call
Through every high and through every low
Let's prove - we can weather the storm

CHORUS
Tonight all my dreams unfold
The hand of love has touched my soul
And I've been waiting for this moment
For all my life and I'll never let it go
The longest journey's reached the end of the road
I will never walk alone as my dreams unfold

Falling down into a hiding place I've found

Leading me to you and where you are

I won't walk away from your love
I've been searching for so long to feel your touch
And I won't walk away from your truth
So when the time arrives, you can come through

Your silence tells me all I need to know
And in the dark of night I see your glow
Your magic moves me when I need to grow

Walking me into a peaceful flow
Now the golden light I see surrounding me
Nourish the barrows when you came to me

Only you can draw the line
Only time can know the distance
Between your world and mine

If you gave me a million reasons
I could never tell you why
I can't say what I believe in
I just feel it inside

As the rain falls, I listen
To the rhythm of your heart
Though we may never be together again
I know we'll never, I know we'll never be apart
Never gonna be apart

All I have left is a picture
All that you left was your name
I'll burn a candle beside my window
That's reflected in the rain

When it's hard to find your way home
Just keep this in mind
If you live inside the moment
You'll know love's a light

As the rain falls I listen
To the rhythm of your heart
Though we may never be together again
I know we'll never, know we'll never be apart
Never gonna be apart

I realize that my trust ain't coming back no more.

When you really care?

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

If you seize that one moment in time
Make it shine

When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away

Este amor, uma canção
Pra fazer feliz a quem se ama

E ter tempo pra sonhar

Quero a vida sempre assim com você perto de mim

Ao encontrar você eu conheci
O que é felicidade meu amor

Wouldn't you rather stay at home

I was late again this morning
I'm lying in the bed I've made

If I had a fallout shelter
I could lock myself inside and sleep
Somebody could come and drop a bomb on me
Maybe then something would change

You're nothing but small talk, is there anybody home
Is there a secret plan that you follow, do you do any thinking of your own
Make up your mind, flip a coin or something
Just say anything but I don't know
You do so much sneaking around, is it some kind of a stupid little game
Let's pretend that you're the master mind, and I'm your little blind dope

[Chorus]
Stay out of my sight, I'll put you out of my mind
Don't even want to know you anymore
Stay out of my sight, I'll put you out of my mind
Out of my mind
Don't even want to know you anymore
Stay out of my sight, I'll put you out of my mind

How did you get this far, understanding nothing at all
You're nothing but small talk, is there anybody home
Transparent, simple mind
Just hold your hands over my eyes
Unless you're trying to insult me
You'd better work harder on those lies

[Chorus]",Out of My Mind
Samiam,"What the hell have you got to look forward to
I don't hear anybody knocking at your door
Your whole life has been a message in a bottle
Dumped in the ocean, never reaching any shore

At the point where nothing makes you happy
These days seem darker than they've ever been before
Here it comes again, that old familiar feeling
Get sick and leave your troubles on the floor

[Chorus]
(Just when I thought you were breaking down
Just when I thought you were breaking down
She found you
Just when I thought you were breaking down
Just when I thought you were breaking down)

You're shuttin' people out has become more like a reflex
They used to be your friends, but they don't know you anymore
Don't mean to hurt you, but it's my only self defense
I make myself a mystery, so they don't know who to look for

Look at yourself, have you noticed your complexion
Looks like you've been spending too much time indoors
In the mirror can you see your reflection
Or am I the only one who's noticed that you look bored

[Chorus]

I watched you fall apart
And never made a sound

What the hell have you got to look forward to
I don't hear anybody knocking at your door
Your whole life has been a message in a bottle
Dumped in the ocean, never reaching any shore

At the point where nothing makes you happy
These days seem darker than they've ever been before
Here it comes again, that old familiar feeling
Get sick and leave your troubles on the floor

[Chorus]",She Found You
Samiam,"Get off the tracks, always the same things on your mind
Everything that you deserve, and how you've been denied it
You want it all so bad, no matter what you have
Can't be satisfied, with anything less than more

[Chorus]
Think you've made it, close your eyes, and open up your hands
While you were waiting, someone left footprints in your back
Your white leather couch is with that wallet full of cash
And gold plated egos shine up nicely with some class
Don't care how you get it, and you might regret it
As soon as things get brighter, you cram your head right up your ass

[Chorus: x2]
You want to be the one that does the telling what to do
So people like yourself will wish that they were you
You want it all so bad, no matter what you have
Can't be satisfied with anything less than more

[Chorus: x2]",While You Were Waiting
Samiam,"Sitting in the corner I don't know what to think I can't 
Speak I sink a little deeper with every drink I try to sleep I shut my eyes 
And like a leaky faucet fear floods the room the one that drips away 
Patiently by day it was either lost or it was stolen but it's been missing 
For too long I woke up one morning and I couldn't see the sunrise I can't 
Recall the exact moment now but it began some time ago and it makes me wonder 
After all I've done what have I got to show I'm aggravated I'm what you 
Created now don't break me",Don't Break Me [Live]
Samiam,"There's this bridge I've got to cross I feel alone.
A child down to each side and I can't carry both. 
The bridge is long we could fall down through holes, 
Water all around; wind, wet and cold. 
One child insecure displays the confidence he doesn't own, 
Another child, uncertain, looks around and cries for home. 
My bridge is too unstable and the insecurity is letting go. 
There's no holding to a crumbling bridge. 
When all the time is gone in between it tumbles. 
Time to move along
I toss and turn over and over, 
Trying to dream out anxiety, 
Easy answers to my problems. 
Keeping a grip on sanity 
Until the sun comes up 
And my mind's fresh and clean.",The Bridge
Samiam,"I'd like to hide away somewhere without light 
Somewhere dark and warm no given chance to lose 
Without a care in my head I could sleep right through 
I gave it all away today those empty stares won't be from me 
There's not much to look forward to just as long as I can't remember 
Took a shower today couldn't feel the water hit my face 
Pinched the skin on my arm and I couldn't feel pain 
I guess my wish came true so now may I not lose",Clean
Samiam,"is there a need for advertising 
me i might be a pigeon but i'm whole 
i've got this crazy notion i can get there for free 
this one's for sale everybody's criticizing 
but i don't get much advice i guess that's what i get for trying 
this one's for sale so what am i supposed to do this one's for you",For Sale
Samiam,"You reel me in from a real long leash pulling me in just to tell me a speech I don't like the looks of that do you like the looks of that I gave it all I had you pull my head all over this town I get the feeling that I'm about to drown visions of you are just like me maybe that's the way you want me to be maybe we are too much alike or maybe not enough but some good times we've had



",Great
Samiam,"Day dreams on the ceiling ridges in my memories 
Resting for the evening to warm to freeze 
Give me a reason why should I doubt something that comes so easy 
It's better than being down and out 
Free from the grind and breathing in it's so easy to drift away",Slumbering
Samiam,"I wish I could be a part of your sadness. 
I wish I could cry for you. 
I hate to think of what you are going through
But, I've never known, 
I can't even sympathize. 
I can't even sympathize, I can't even sympathize
As I imitate your mood I feel so callous, so hard inside. 
Because my eyes are dry, 
I can't even sympathize. 
I just hope that it will be OK along the way.",Sympathy
Samiam,"So now I know you have to say what's on your little mind 
And I always have to hear from someone else 
All your stupid lies come on now and look at me you'll see I'm okay 
It's story time now time for you to show your shallow existence 
It doesn't add up too much your junior insecurity 
Now I see that you're afraid of me",Tell Me a Story
Samiam,"Seems like the further I get from here things come on time
Seems like the closer I get to home I'm way out of time 
I think about where to go it's always I don't know every time 
I think there is someone no one has shown where d'ya go 
I heard a voice in the dark and I knew it was you",Where'd Ya Go?
Samiam,"You're got it all between your fingers.
What you want you just can't grab.
You want it, all
What you want you just can't have.
Sand sifts through, with my disgust.
And with my sympathy, chains lay in rust.
You want someone to hold you together.
But you're way too ""strong"", you?e way too proud.
You want someone to be around.
What you want, you need gone.
It's old, it's dirty, it's cold outside,
It's lonely, it's ugly, it's all around.",You Looking at Me
Samiam,"The meeting convened at three a.m.
To satisfy the needs of the disenchanted friends
She left her charm bracelet by the bed
I kept it tough I don't know what it meant

Something to hold
Memories of my own
An absentminded offering (Oh, yeah)

I can't stand the sound of her voice
We'd never talk at all if I had my choice
She says things to me like she heard them on TV
I only hope no one is watching

I know once I get you home
I won't care anymore
I'll do anything not to be alone, not to be alone [2x]",Anything
Samiam,"I drove past his house
You walked out the door
I wasn't surprised
I know you've been there before

I'm amazed
I still even care
I must have something left
I don't know where

I'm tired of being right
About how wrong i was
Thinking I could trust you
Just because I wanted to

Yeah I'm a believer
And I don't know why

You say you can't control
What makes you act that way
You also said never again
It must have sounded better then

Every time I'm burned
It hurts a little less
You don't want me to leave
But you want him more I guess",Believer
Samiam,"Pull down the blinds
Don't think I'll make it out today
Spilling down from the sky
Another day one more than I can take

Get my irons from the fire
Cause mistakes are all I seem able to make these days
Later to bed, later to rise
Feeling unhealthy, unwealthy and unwise

I'm not screening calls
I just ain't answering the phone
Don't come banging on my door
Please just leave me alone

I don't know another way
I'm waiting for my luck to change
Without you by my side

This loneliness I feel
Is the kind I fear I'll keep
I'm trying to fall out of love
But I'm only falling asleep

I miss you so much
I might as well miss everyone
Ain't we having fun",Bide My Time
Samiam,"I don't think I ever told you
When cords and wires were the same
I set fire to the field
Where you told me not to play
With a little girl named Amy
And we just ran away

I remember seeing a ladder
It reached up to the sky
Along the side of our building
I didn't realize
I'd climbed so high
You were there to bring me down

On radio corona
Singing with Charlie rich again
You hit every puddle
From here to San Rafael

You try to be happy
I like it when you call me pal
I know you want to protect me
Even when you don't know how

I wish you knew how much I miss you
When you don't come home from work
I try to be a decent person
I want you to be proud
Sometimes it's not so easy
When you're not around",Come Home
Samiam,"I've tried to tell you how I'm feeling
But something's always lost along the way
From my heart to your mind it never comes out right
You don't want to hear it anyway

Do you want to be loved
Do you want to be loved
Do you want to be loved
Do you want to be loved

Always trying to make sure
You never get any more then you deserve
And you won't settle for less
Then less than second best
You're never disappointed that way

Do you want to be loved

Samiam,"Why would I ever consider
Letting myself get wrapped up again with you
I spent more than just my time
Begging you to stop the fucked up things you do
Before I gave up on you

But we'll get it right
We'll get it right
This time
We'll get it right
We'll get it right
We'll get it right
This time

You don't want me telling people
What went down before you got your head on straight
When they see you with me now
They look at you as if they know
Must have found out anyway

But we'll get it right
We'll get it right
This time
We'll get it right
Get it right
Get it right
This time

Think it's worth another try
Starting over don't seem possible to me
We'd only be continuing
Continuing with more of the same
Just more of the same

Samiam,"Wake me stop me from shaking
I never want to dream that dream again
I'm tired of the lullabies you sing me
I wish I could get them out of my head

See how far from home I've drifted
I don't revolve around you no more
You act like I've been drawn away by another distant star
But you know you cast me off yourself

We don't always keep our promises
I don't want to be tied down
Some dreams never make any sense
At least they don't make sense to me
They don't make sense right now

Did you think that I was faking
When I said I couldn't take it anymore
In the world you're making
There's no room for anyone but yourself",Lullaby
Samiam,"Black clouds hang over you
Like anvils on a string
They follow you everywhere so
Don't stand so close to me

They gather while you're sleeping
And wait above your bed
And when you open up your eyes
They strap themselves fast to your head

Dreamed through another starless night
Awakened by the gloom this morning
I keep myself buttoned tight
These storms come without warning
There seems to be no end in sight
This shit could last forever
I've been through this before
There's no predicting weather you

Will find your way around
Whatever's got you down
Whatever's got you down

The lines across your brow
Tell me the entire story
I won't be listening
While you go on about your fears and worries

Dreamed through another starless night
Awakened by the gloom this morning
I keep myself buttoned tight
These storms come without warning
There seems to be no end in sight
This shit could last forever
I've been through this before
There's no predicting weather you

Will find your way around
Whatever's got you down
Whatever's got you down

You blow into the room
I pour myself some shelter
I know the storm is coming soon
I'm sensitive to changes in pressure

I spent another sleepless night
On your couch tossing and turning
Sometimes I don't know why I try
I think my neck is broken

There seems to be no end in sight
This shit could last forever
I've been through this before
There's no predicting weather you

Will find your way around
Whatever's got you down
Whatever's got you down
Can you find your way around
Whatever's got you down
You're bringing us all down",Storm Clouds
Samiam,"I hope you got the help you needed
I'm so sorry for the way I treated you
Didn't know you were so defenseless
If you don't regain your senses someday soon

If you come down I hope you land safely
I know you think the world's fucking crazy but it's you
Maybe you went home to your family
If they exist never know how much of what you say is true

Who'll take care of you
Who'll take care of you
Who'll take care of you
When no one else will

Never thought you had a thing worth breaking
Don't know how I ever could have been so cruel
You needed to be protected
But once you make up your mind there's no persuading you

Who's gonna take care of you
Who's gonna take care of you
Who's gonna take care of you
When no one else will",Take Care
Samian,"J’représente ma nation, ma culture, ma passion
Ma raison de vivre!
Mes origines, ma fierté, ma zone grise!
Faut pas oublier que j’viens de l’Abitibi
Sur une terre algonquine, on m’a appris la vie!
Avec mes joies et mes peines
ma rage, ma haine!
Tout ce qui a joué contre moi-même 
Devenu la cause de mes problèmes!
La crise d’oka a rien à voir avec mon cas
Mais j’vais me battre jusqu'au bout pour défendre nos droits!
J’veux suivre la voie de mes ancêtres
être la voix de mon peuple!
Une langue en voie d’extinction
J’veux rebâtir la Nation!
Car je représente ma Nation, bref, ma génération,
Mon peulple, mes ancêtres! Il y a pas mille façons d’être
Je suis ce que je suis , je suis fier de l’être
Et je suis le premier de ce monde à apprendre à me connaître!
Juger par nos paroles? J’ai pas choisi les paraboles!
J’aime mieux dire les vraies choses, ce qui fait de moi un porte-parole!!

Refrain :
On me dit que c’est la vie? C’est la vie!
Fuck that! L’injustice qui t’instruit
Mais dans l’fond ça te détruit!
On dirait que je peux encore entendre les hurlements
Et quand on me parle de mon histoire moi j’trouve ça dégoûtant!
Mais dire que c’était nos vies, une mémoire impardonnable!
La même vie sale que les enfants de Duplessis!
Estie! On a tous nos p’tits soucis 
Mais quand ça touche toute une Nation moi j’me sacrifie!

Quand j’vois que dans ma communauté ça tourne mal!
J’essaie de changer l’monde avec mes cordes vocales!
De les conscientiser, d’arrêter d’ignorer!
On fait partie de l’histoire mais l’histoire est loin d’être terminée!
Mettre dans des réserves ça veut dire mettre de côté
Mais mon opinion les derniers seront les premiers!
Je suis un millitant! J’ai beau me battre pour la cause
On n’en mérite pas tant! Regardes ailleurs c’est la même chose!
En Afrique! Les peuples blancs qui contrôlent!
Ils ont débarqué avec des Bibles, pis ils ont volé les terres!
Ils ont fait la même chose ici, penses-tu vraiment que j’vais m’taire?
Ceux qui pensent le contraire, ils s’mêlent pas de leurs affaires!
On est mis à part et l’gouvernement a fait sa part
Dur d’admettre ses torts, mais j’veux vous l’faire savoir!
C’est bon de savoir la vérité
Et en tant q’Amérindien j’trouve qu’on n’a pas mérité
D’être où est-ce qu’on est!!

Refrain :
On me dit que c’est la vie? C’est la vie!
Fuck that! L’injustice qui t’instruit
Mais dans l’fond ça te détruit!
On dirait que je peux encore entendre les hurlements
Et quand on me parle de mon histoire moi j’trouve ça dégoûtant!
Mais dire que c’était nos vies, une mémoire impardonnable!
La même vie sale que les enfants de Duplessis!
Estie! On a tous nos p’tits soucis 
Mais quand ça touche toute une Nation moi j’me sacrifie!

La Loi sur les indiens a obligé les pensionnats
Ma famille a passé là! Pis ils ont passé l’âge d’en parler!
Renfermée, sans clef, de l’interieure qu’ils ont créé!
Parce qu’il y a des violeurs d’enfants trop lâches pour s’excuser!
Ça fait qu’ils envoient de l’argent, de l’orde du gouvernement
Sans aucune excuses pour les viols et les attouchements!
Il y a de quoi de pas normal , c’est pour ça que j’en parle!
Et si ça te rend mal à l’aise, bien c’est à toi que j’parle!
Il y a certaines communautés affectées par la mortalité
Des jeunes en crise d’identité, c’est plus la même mentalité!
Mais la réalité, hiver comme été!
On a vécu le même calvaire mais pas dans l’même quartier!
Je suis plutôt réaliste, loin de l’imaginaire
Malgré ma souffrance je remets tout à la Mère-Terre!
Moi j’parle au nom du peuple, au nom de ma Nation
De ceux qui en on souffert, yo! Bienvenue dans mon monde!!",Injustice
Samian,"Je me présente Samian, je débarque dans le hip hop
j'avance à grand pas pis j'ai pas les pieds dans la même botte

aujourd'hui je rappe pour ma cause pis je t’en offre une dose
c'est mes tounes, mes histoires, mes problèmes
ma façon de voir la vie pis c'est une façon de voir la tienne
il y a des trucs sur l'album que j'ai jamais dit à personne
j'me dévoile...  sans faire de mal à personne
j’suis tellement simple, c'est tout ce que le rap me transmet
j’suis humble et vrai! c'est tout ce que le rap me permet
mais dans l'fond....   j'ai pas besoin de permissions
parce que je dis ce que je pense et je pense comme j'écris
je sais d'où je viens pis je sais où je vais!
c'est pas le cas de tout l'monde pis c'est pas tout l'monde qui pense comme ça!
je suis le gars que tu vois, pis je reste ce que je suis
si je suis debout devant toi c'est que le travail a porté fruit
yo! fuck l'attitude je suis le même gars que d'habitude
j'ai marché dans des chemins où l’asphalte était rude!
dans l'illégalité!!
t'es pas rappeur par style mais par mentalité!

faut arrêter de tourner en rond, pis de rester stable
j'ai essayé une couple de fois, estie que j'étais détestable
c'est dans ces temps là que je prend mon pack sac
toujours le même shit, jamais à même date!
mais bon, je fais avec!!
parce que t’as pas l'choix de vivre avec!
on a tous fait le con pis c'est l'temps de l'admettre!
pas d'études pas de travail!
j'ai décidé de faire du rap et c'est le rap qui me travaille
où est-ce que tu veux que j'aille, partout c'est pareil
attentif aux conseils, n'importe quel con s'essaye!
ce que j'aime... c'est la liberté d'expression 
sans même poser un geste on peut faire une action!
la vie peut être belle c'est ce qu’on appelle le paradis
c'est juste qu’on ne nous l’a pas dit!!
Une réalité de communauté, loin du millieu urbain
avec la même mentalité, c'est-à-dire le rêve Americain
l'argent mène le monde pis on se plaint le ventre plein
au salaire minimum, obligé de faire ça à temps plein!
d'autres sont mis à part, par un système qui roule sur l'or
et d'autres sont mis à mort par une justice qui dort
je viens d'une p'tite réserve au nord, il est temps que le vent tourne de bord
je rappe pour les miens jusqu’à ma mort! parce qu’on est mis à part!
aussi bien nous mettre la peine de mort! avec le même décor
mais fuck off on reste fort, il est temps que t'apprennes mon histoire!",Intro
Samian,"Dans une ville appelée Kapak, lieu de débarquement, mes ancêtres ont fait leur pack sac pacifiquement,
Sur l’Anikana, en route au nord du Canada, (Canada, Canada, Canada)
Samian, Loco Locass, il était temps que l’union se fasse, qu’on remonte la vraie histoire pour qu’on puisse y faire face,
On veut mettre un pont entre les nations, confondre la culture, ignorer les préjugés, laisser parler la nature

La barrière entre les peuples, on veut plus la casser, on en a plus qu’assez, on est placés pour parler,
On remonte le temps dans le pantalon de Cristophe Colomb qui découvre l’Amérique et tous ces peuples qui y habitent
On était pacifiques et encore, même aujourd’hui, un homme blanc sur l’Atlantique qui rêvait de faire son pays,
On fume le calumet de paix, sans rancune, on est capables de rester vrais même si on porte plus de plumes

L’union de deux nations freine l’ignorance,
Pousse les connaissances avec un peu de reconnaissance
Mon histoire et la tienne, ça fait deux,
Je fais partie de deux peuples, donc je finirai comme l’un d’eux

De l’Europe à l’Amérique, j’ai traversé l’Atlantique à cette époque épique, au pays du porc-épic,
La maladie du scorbut scorait droit au but et c’est aux premières nations que je dois ma guérison
Raquette, canot, boucane, tisane et toboggan, l’authentique Autochtone enseigna au profane
La science de la savane, sans se douter qu’en filigrane, la soutane mégalomane allait lui casser le crâne

Pour les Amérindindiens, en Amérique, il y a deux choix : soit on les abat comme aux États,
Ou bien soit on les réserve comme au Canada, mais réserve ou abat, le problème demeure le même
Car tombent une à une les quilles de leurs emblèmes, les visages pâles peuvent ben devenir blêmes,
Désolé pour le passé, à présent, qu’est-ce qu’on fait? allume le calumet, qu’on fume pour la grande paix

Samir Fejzic,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,

I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
And I like you under my skin.",I've Got You Under My Skin
Samirah Evans,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",Nearness of You
Sammi Smith,"Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
I won't make it any other way
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now

Sammi Smith,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk

Sammi Smith,"Sometimes when I'm down and all alone
Just like a child without a home
The love you give me keeps me hangin' on
Oh honey,  all I ever need is you
You're my first love, you're my last
You're my future, you're my past
And loving you is all I ask, honey
All I ever need is you
Winters come and they go, and we watch the melting snow
Sure as summer follows spring, all the things you do
Give me a reason to build my world around you
Some men follow rainbows, I am told
Some men search for silver some for gold
I have found my treasure in your soul, honey
All I ever need is you
Without love I'd never find the way
Through ups and downs of every single day
I won't sleep at night until you say, my honey
All I ever need is you",All I Ever Need Is You

Talking on the telephone

Things have changed cause 

Now I don't know 
Exactly what to say 
To find out if she feels the same way 
And if she don't then that will break my heart

I can't believe I'm falling for her 
I'm catching feelings 
Don't want to hold back no more 
'Cause she's the only one I adore 

I tried to hide the, the way I feel for her 
But when she's near me I tend to let it show 
But getting jealous, but now there's talk to her 
Why can't I get the nerve to call 
And let my feelings show girl

Ain't it funny how life goes down?
You moved away with your parents to another town
Ain't seen you since we were little kids
Now that you're back in the hood I can't believe it

Eating candy solving the world
Tryna play it out, bright lights, butterflies
That's what happen from the spot
It's been a minute since we broke up
Can we pick up where we left off?
Baby, tell me can we go?

Let it ride
I gotta let it ride, let it ride
That's the only thing that I can do

Maybe I jumped in too fast
Should've took my time
But I was so excited that you wanted to be mine
Girl I was straight with you
I didn't play no games stayed true
Even when my boys said that I was a fool

Everything I do I owe it all to you.
Without your love and care what would I do
Can't imagine my life without you
Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama [x2]

[Chorus until fades]

Oh
Oh no no

oh baby girl
We need to take it slow
Take it slow
Take it slow

Anything that you want
Do you not get it all
When you need me
Do I not pick up the phone and call
This ain't about the games
Or when or who lose fault
Cause they don't mean a thing
Girl I want to give you my all
But first we gotta take it

[Chorus]
Slow girl (slow girl)
Just relax your mind
Sit back and unwind ah baby
Baby take it slow girl
We don't have to rush
Good things come to those who wait
Baby take it slow girl
Baby take it easy
We goin' be together always
Baby take it slow
I'm gonna take it slow
We goin' take it slow

You may not understand but in due time
Girl I want your body but first I need your mind
Girl come follow me, take my hand, let me show you the way oh
To my lake of love, that never runs dry, you can swim all day
But first we gotta take it

Sammie,"Oh, no, oh, no, I don't wanna seem like a player girl
But I gotta play my cards right
And tell you the truth about what I like
It's the simplest things

The way you walk, the way you talk
Girl you're so fly
But your girls got my eye
I think you should know that

Baby, you're so fine
What about your friend?
The one that was with you when you walked in
Girl I know you don't hear this often

Shorty, you're so fine
What about your friend?
The one that was with you when you walked in through the door
She's what I'm looking for

Baby, look on the bright side
Though you won't be with me
You can still go with the team
Girl, as long as your friend is coming

I won't rush that I know, I gotta know
What's up with this hook up girl
Her beauty's a crime
And she needs to be handcuffed, ohh

I've been feeling this feeling
For too long and I can't go on
Unless she give me her digits
For that call and we finally talk

Ooh, she's sexy
And I'd be completely satisfied
If she would only touch me
When she's ready to leave, ooh girl

You're so fine
What about your friend?
The one that was with you when you walked in
Girl, I know you don't hear this often, ohh, baby

Shorty, you're so fine
What about your friend?
The one that was with you when you walked in through the door
She's what I'm looking for

Ohh, baby, looking good but your girl look better
Ohh, no, no, no, no, no, no
She's so fine girl
I really dig your girlfriend, she's so fine girl, ooh

You're so fine
What about your friend?
The one that was with you when you walked in
I know you don't hear this often

Shorty, you're so fine
What about your friend?
The one that was with you when you walked in through the door
She's what I'm looking for

Hey, ooh, she's so fine girl
I really dig her sexy style
'Cause she so fine, yeah, ooh no, no
Please don't be mad at me but she's so sexy
Ah, nah, nah, ah, nah, nah, let it play, let it play, ah, nah, nah

O-Only one, o-one
O-Only one

You were so out of my league like
I was lost for words
I couldn’t even begin to speak right
Not to mention each night
Couldn’t seem to spark that conversation
I kept stalling out just waiting at the green light (G-g-g-green light)
Push the clutch and finally broke the damn ice
Would have done it sooner had I knew you were intrigued by me
Had no idea kept making these excuses
Now you’re mine and I’m gon’ prove it
I’m gon’ prove it, I’m gon’ prove it

Just had to say you’re the only one
I can’t deny it or stall any longer
Girl you have done the impossible
Can’t even lie you’re the only only only one
Girl you’re the only one (Ooh)
Girl you’re the only one (Ooh)
Girl you’re the only, only, only, one

Girl, you would so be on that fly shit
And I can’t even tell you or explain how wide my eyes get
When you walk in the room it’s
Hard to keep a friendly conversation 'cause everyone’s stuck on my chick
My, my, my, my, my, my chick
Everyone look at my chick
She got the touch and moves to make me lose it, when we grinding

She make the room light up but that’s the last thing on her mind
Dude told me this would happen I just thought that he was lying

Just had to say you’re the only one
I can’t deny it or stall any longer
Girl you have done the impossible
Can’t even lie you’re the only, only, only one (Ooh)

Oh, o-only one o-one (Ooh)
O-Only one (oOh)

Crazy never thought this would happen
But your love knocked me out
So before I write a flatten
Any question thought or doubt
And now I’m stuck deeper
Yup, and I swear it’s true
But I can’t go out and I can’t look around
'Cause none of these girls compare to you

Just had to say you’re the only one
I can’t deny it or stall any longer
Girl you have done the impossible
Can’t even lie you’re the only, only, only one (Ooh)

Don't let it go to waste

Oh yea, yea
I say life's what you make it
Whether you working nights or day shift
Extra money on the side as a waitress
While you go to school, tryna keep your grades straight
You a dropout
Never fit in with the crowd, getting cropped out
In every picture that your crew and cool friends post on Facebook
A Twitter or whatever they on
And it's no wonder why you feel alone
Parents moved so much you never had a home
Just tune out the world, you can turn me on
No, I'm just here for you for a couple songs
No, I'm just here for you for a couple songs
So tell me what your pain is
Being you what defined you as a great kid
It's the easy way out so go get wasted
But if you get a chance to change don't waste it

Every day
That you wanna change
And break away
And break away
Every day ay ay
That you get faded
While they get famous
It's also takin it

You gon wake up on the right side
Instead of lookin back you lookin for the bright side
Oh you got a good look from a bad chick
And some other shit that you didn't expect to happen
See the point of the story kid is to dream big
You never know what's gonna be there when the saints wakes
Could be you on a soldout stage
Just the fans that raise anything you say
I'm talkin to everybody in the world
Who's ever been scared of reach
Who's ever been scared of girls
Who's ever been scared of boys
I'm talkin to all of yall
Telling you stay true, I'm telling you stand tall
'Cause all it takes is one move to be on your way
Whether you're tall, fat, skinny, pretty, straight or gay
Seems easy to say fuck it and get wasted

You got caught off a good thing
Get a job, just becoming something routine
And you feel like the whole world hates
But it's something that your soul can't fix so
Take a deep breath, take a step back
Know you good as long as you can get past
All the pressure but it's close til you taste it
But if you get a chance to change don't waste it

Maxing out all my credit cards
Living my own L.A. story
Living it up 'til the morning

Sammy
I'm not trying to show you love and affection
I'm trying to live the life a kid always expected
Over on Sunset, finished a couple sessions
One foot in the door, one in the hills, questions
Angels in leather, I ain't talking 'bout the motor club
But I tend to go hella hard when I go to clubs
Minibar murder, I'm on Denzel's flight
With a stewardess that wants to fuck the whole damn night
Who cares what they all say
Try'na find some girls like Hov did with Beyonce
Had you for a week but I heard you say fiance
Na na, none of that girl

I fell in love, the streets got a glow
The city of angels is calling me home

And she said, and she said uh

I'm waking up on Sunset Boulevard
Maxing out all my credit cards
Living my own L.A. story
Living it up 'til the morning
We'll be taking shots under the stars
Living off of hotel minibars
Living our own L.A. story
Living it up, living it up
We living it up

Everybody's a model or a wannabe
If you're that bad it's in Paris where you ought'a be
She's an actress, working on the late shift
Only longs for a big break as a waitress
Walk the strip, see the fashion getting wacky now
Out the door, passing out
Hit the floor, Pacquiao
Credit card at the bar never closing out
But the weather's so nice, nobody slowing down
Well except for the 101
Gotta SUV stuck in traffic with a ton of buds
I can promise you tonight's gon' be a ton of fun
Know that c-c-c-c

'Cause I fell in love, the streets got a glow
The city of angels is calling me home

And she said, and she said uh
I'm waking up on Sunset Boulevard
Maxing out all my credit cards

Living it up 'til the morning
We'll be taking shots under the stars
Living off of hotel minibars
Living our own L.A. story
Living it up, living it up
We living it up

Upper Edge Cafe like Vinny Chase
She got a big booty, itty bitty skinny waist
Henny straight, everyday summer
Never on the sheets like you're on top of the cover
Every day when I'm away look at the toe so
Look at the cops, don't even care, you can just blow smoke
I'm Robin Hood on the beat
I get paid in L.A. and give it back to the D

I fell in love, the streets got a glow
The city of angels is calling me home

And she said, and she said uh

Before it's too late, my love
Get out of town
Be good to me, please

Why wish me harm?
Why not retire to a farm
And be contented to charm
The birds off the trees?

Just disappear
I care for you much too much

That comes with each new love affair

At break of dawn, there is no sunrise

What lonely hours, with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything

I tell you I mean it

It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Your arms opened wide and closed me inside
You took my lips, you took my love so tenderly",Tenderly

Don't you know, I haven't a chance

True I've been seen with somebody new

"Sammy Davis, Jr.","Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn!
I've grown accustomed to her face.
She almost makes the day begin.
I've grown accustomed to the tune
That she whistles night and noon.
Her smiles, her frowns,
Her ups, her downs
Are second nature to me now,
Like breathing out and breathing in.

I was serenely independent
And content before we met.
Surely I could always be that way again - and yet,
I've grown accustomed to her look,
Accustomed to her voice,
Accustomed to her face.

Marry Freddy. What an infantile idea. What a heartless,
wicked, brainless thing to do. But she'll regret it. It's
doomed before they even take the vow.

I can see her now, Mrs. Freddy Eynsford-Hill,
In a wretched little flat above a store.
I can see her now, not a penny in the till,
And a bill collector beating at the door.
She'll try to teach the things I taught her,
And end up selling flowers instead.
Begging for her bread and water,
While her husband has his breakfast in bed.

In a year or so, when she's prematurely grey,
And the blossom in her cheek has turned to chalk,
She'll come home and lo,
He'll have upped and run away,
With a social-climbing heiress from New York.
Poor Eliza. How simply frightful!
How humiliating! How delightful!

How poignant it'll be on that inevitable night
When she hammers on my door in tears and rags.
Miserable and lonely, repentant and contrite,
Will I take her in or hurl her to the walls?
Give her kindness or the treatment she deserves?
Will I take her back or throw the baggage out?

But, I'm a most forgiving man,
The sort who never could, never would,
Take a position and staunchly never budge.
A most forgiving man.

But I shall never take take her back
If she were even crawling on her knees.
Let her promise to atone,
Let her shiver, let her moan,
I'll slam the door and let the hell-cat freeze!

Marry Freddy, HA!

But I'm so used to hear her day,
""Good morning"" ev'ry day.
Her joys, her woes,
Her highs, her lows,
Are second nature to me now,
Like breathing out and breathing in.

I'm very grateful she's a woman,
And so easy to forget, rather like a habit
One can always break - and yet,
I've grown accustomed to the trace,
Of something in the air,
Accustomed to her face.",I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face

They don't even see me flying by so fast
They're moving, going who knows where
Only thing I know is I am not going there

Where do you go
When you feel that your brain is on fire
Where do you go
When you don't even know what it is you desire

Listen, laughter everywhere
Hear it, life is in the air
As the night comes and the town awakes
Sound of children calling
And the squeal of brakes

Music but a lonely song
When you can't help wondering
Where do I belong
When you can't help wondering
Where do I belong

"Sammy Davis, Jr.","There she is, my old gal,
There he is, my old pal,
And here am I, broken hearted!
She was mine in May, his in June,
She forgot mighty soon,
And here am I, broken hearted!

The last time that we said goodbye,
I knew that we were through!
It's bad enough that I lost her,
I only had to lose him too!

Therer they go in their joy,
Happy girl and lucky boy!
And here am I, broken hearted!
Oh, my heart will never ever know a pain
If I hadn't ever loved in vain,
But here am I, broken hearted!",(Here I Am) Brokenhearted
"Sammy Davis, Jr.","Jealousy, night and day you torture me
I sometimes wonder, if this spell that I'm under
Can only be a melody, for I know no one but me 
Has won your heart, but when the music starts

My peace departs from the moment
they play that lovely strain
And we surrender to all it's charm again
This jealousy that tortures me, is ecstasy, mystery, pain

We dance to a tango of love
Your heart beats with mine as we sway
You eyes give the answer I'm dreaming of
That soft word your cruel lips will never say

I fear that the music will end
And shatter the spell it may lend
To make me believe, when your eyes just deceive
But it's only the tango you love.

Too bad he didn't finish it
Gershwin took a chord in 'G'
Proceeded to diminish it
I sought a variation

And I found my inspiration

The Campbells and Vermicellis
All form a part of my tenement symphony

My friend, I'll say it clear,
I'll state my case of which I'm certain.

I've lived a life that's full,
I travelled each and every highway,
And more, much more than this,
I did it My Way.

Regrets, I've had a few,
But then again too few to mention
Did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
Planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this,
I did it My Way.

Yes there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it My Way.

I've loved,
I've laughed and cried,
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say not in a shy way

Oh no, oh no not me
I did it My Way

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught. 
To say the things he truly feels; 
And not the words of one who kneels. 
The record shows 
I took the blows - 
And did it my way!",My Way

Were searching for a different tune
One that they could croon
As only they can
They only had the rhythm
So they started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what to use
That is how the blues really began
They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that the start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down-hearted frail
And they played that
As part of the blues
From a whippoorwill
Out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'Til it was worn
Into a blue note
And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the Southland gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues

Boy, how they could love!
Swore to be true to each other,
True as the stars above!
'Cause he was her man,
But he done her wrong!

One night Frankie happened to pass by the hotel;
Just casually glanced into a window so high,
And who did she see but her lovin' man
Lovin' up old Nellie Bligh!
She caught her man
Doin' her wrong!

Well, she went round the corner to her favourite pawn shop;
This time she didn't go there for fun!
'Cause when she left, underneath her long red kimono,
She was totin' a forty-four gun!
She was gunnin' for her man
Who was doin' her wrong!

Then back Frankie dashed to that hotel,
Started yankin' the bell!
She said, ""Stand back, you madam and floozies,
Or I'll blow each and every one of you straight to hell!
I want my man
Who's done me wrong!"".

Johnnie, in panic, mounted the staircase,
Screamin', ""Oh Frankie, don't shoot!""
Three times she pulled a trigger on a forty-four gun,
The gun went, ""Root-toot-toot!"".
She nailed her man
Who'd done her wrong!

So they put her away in a dungeon,
Way up in a dark dingy cell
In the south east corner of a jail,
Where the wind seemed to blow straight from hell!
For killin' her man
Who done her wrong!

But the day Frankie mounted the scaffold,
She was just as calm as any gal could be!
And raising her eyes to heaven she cried,
""Lord, I'm comin' to thee!
I'm sorry I killed my man
Who done me wrong!"".",Frankie and Johnny

Were searching for a different tune
One that they could croon
As only they can
They only had the rhythm
So they started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what to use
That is how the blues really began
They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that the start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down-hearted frail
And they played that
As part of the blues
From a whippoorwill
Out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
Till it was worn
Into a blue note
And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the Southland gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues [Live]

Put on a happy face;
Brush off the clouds and cheer up,
Put on a happy face.

Take off the gloomy mask of tragedy,
It's not your style;
You'll look so good that you'll be glad
Ya' decide to smile!

Pick out a pleasant outlook,
Stick out that noble chin;
Wipe off that ""full of doubt"" look,
Slap on a happy grin!

And spread sunshine all over the place,
Just put on a happy face!
Put on a happy face
Put on a happy face

And if you're feeling cross and bitterish
Don't sit and whine
Think of banana split and licorice
And you'll feel fine

She wouldn't listen to me

Standing on the corner feeling blue

We climb the stair
We never knock
For nobody's there

On a cold winter's night that was so deep.

cho: Noel, Noel
Noel,Noel
Born is the King of Israel.
They looked up and saw a star

Shining in the East, beyond them far,
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued, both day and night.
And by the light of that same star

Three wise men came from country far,
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.
This star drew nigh to the northwest;

O'er Bethlehem it took its rest.
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place whcre Jesus lay.
Then they did know assuredly

Within that house, the King did lie
One entered in then for to see
And found the babe in poverty.
Then entered in those wise men three,

Full reverently, upon bended knee,
And offered there, in His presence,
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.
If we in our time do well

We shall be free from death and hell
For God hath prepared for us all

Sammy Hagar,"Sometimes everything works out okay. 
And sometimes seems to go the other way. 
But it really don't matter at all. 
It depends upon how quickly you rise when you fall. 
So make sure you don't stay down too long. 
Sometimes nothing can go wrong. 
And some times the good times don't stay too long. 
But don't cry, find out why they don't. 
And the next time you think that they will go, but they won't 
And the good times will be there if you want. 
You try, try to fall in love. 
It's the key to everything 
It's the calling of the wind 
That sings to you and plays for you when you are down. 
You try, try to look above 
To the clouds up in the sky. 
That is where the music lies. 
And you can have it when you fall in love. 
Sometimes the music don't come out too well. 
And sometimes there really isn't much to tell. 
But nothing's wrong, it's a song you feel. 
And the moment you thought of it, it must have been real. 
Or you wouldn't even thought of it. 
You just try, try to fall in love.

Two generations I've been through 
'69 was heavy, yea, but, what did it prove? 
Just a bunch of hippies could become businessmen 
And burn our bodies, a flag, and a couple of friends. 
Now as we enter 1980 
We're modern humans in a modern time. 
So all you children of the '60's 
It's no easy climb.

Sammy Hagar,"In the chilly hours and minutes of uncertainty
I long to be in the warm halls of your love and mine
To feel you all around me
To take your hand and walk along the sand
Oh, but I may as well try and catch the wind

When sundown pales the sky
I want to hide a while behind your smile
And everywhere I look your eyes I find
For me to love you now would be the sweetest thing
It would make me sing
Yeah, but I may as well try and catch the wind

I'm gonna catch that wind
Help me catch the wind all for you, babe
Just for you, baby

When rain has hung the leaves with tears
I want you near to kill my fear
Help me to leave my blues behind
For standing inside your heart where I want to be

Sammy Hagar,"I was a boy lost inside a man 
Somewhere, somebody must need me. 
Look in the mirror - I see a face 
Oh, man things get lonely. 
You showed me something I can't replace 
You came to me for a whole different space. 
My daddy warned me, momma did too, 
They said, ""Son, see what some lovin' can do"" 
I guess love has found me. 
I guess love, I guess love has found me. 
Just yesterday, I swore to myself 
I was gonna stay free and easy. 
Then my head turned around 
What I was missin' I found. 
From my own trap you freed me 
But all the heartbreak, I've got control 
Willpower when she touches my soul 
Heart attack, but I feel alright. 
With some more on a Texarkana night. 
Love has found me.

Sammy Hagar,"Now, listen... 
My paycheck after taxes barely pays the rent 
I do the town on Friday, by Tuesday, it's all spent. 
Two bucks an hour, this job ain't too hip. 
My lovelife's turning sour working the night-shift. 
It's the pits! It's a one way trip on a sinking ship 
Ain't it the pits, but you just can't quit 
When the scale won't tip or the key don't fit. 
Two $6.50 tickets to hassle with the crowd 
I got hit with a Frizbee, the band played too loud. 
I got all their records, man, and loved all their hits, 
But this is the worst! It's the pits! 
Oh, you can't keep it lit then it sticks to your lip. 
Oh, ain't it the pits when the record skips and the TV quits. 
You're in deeper and deeper, you dig into the pit. 
The climb is always steep - you can't get a lift. 
Ain't it the pits! 
It's the bottom of the list 
It's all wing tips and double-knits. 
It's the pits. 
Slip out onto the freeway, down all the gears- 
Things were just gettin' heavy when the red light appears. 
He said, ""Get outta the car, boy."" 
He put the 'cuffs on my wrist, read me my rights, oh things got intense. 
I got 90 days in jail, no one would go my bail, so there I sit. 
It's the pits! 
When the waist-line slips, 39 inch hips and your pants don't fit. 
You're in deeper, you dig into the pit. 
The climb is always steeper, they won't let you quit. 
Ain't it the pits?! P-I-T-S - it's the pits! 
When the the faucet drips, it won't never quit 
Oh, like a ten-cent tip.

And your self, you touch
But don't touch yourself to much

And your friends they are making
A pop star or two or three, every evening
And you know that seem backward
They can't see the patterns they're weaving

And your skin's so light

So just close your eyes, baby

Sammy Hagar,"Sunday morning, nine A.M.
I saw fire in the sky
I felt my heart pound in my chest
I heard an eagle cry

Hey!

I'm alive when I breathe the air
I feel the wind smell the earth in the air
I watch an eagle rise above the trees
Project myself into what he sees

So take me away 
Come on fly me away 
Lift me up so high
Where eagles fly 

I often dreamed that I could sail through the sky
I've always wished I could fly
The simple life of a bird on the wing
Oh, Lord, I could sing

Take me away 
Come on, fly me away 
Lift me up so high

Where eagles fly

Now I'm alive and I breathe the air
They wash the earth from my face
I catch a glimpse of another dream
I turned, I looked, I turned and looked again, 'cause I see no trace

Take me away
Come on, fly me away
I want to fly away, yeah

Pick me up so high

Where eagles fly

Yeah
Oh, yeah!
C'mon baby!

Sammy Hagar,"She falls somewhere in-between 
Levi's and Vogue Magazine

But what she does she does with taste. 
And you can call her Plain Jane 
But she's drivin' me insane 
Plain Jane - Oh yeah, you're drivin' me insane. 
Plain Jane - Oh, let me love you baby, yeah! 
She kisses with her lips so tight. 
Ooh, it hit's me just like dynamite. 
Her sweet, simple innocence 
Makes everyone else seem like past tense 
And you can call her Plain Jane 
But she's drivin' me insane. 
Plain Jane - Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're drivin' me insane, oh! 
Plain Jane - Heave-ho, oh, let me love you, love you, love you, love you, 
Love you, love you 
Takes a special kind of man. 
To love and understand 
My Plain Jane. 
My Plain Jane - Talkin' 'bout my baby. 
My Plain Jane - Oh yea. 
Plain Jane - Uh-huh, my 
Plain Jane - Ain't no body else no. 
Plain Jane - Tellin' you you're drivin me insane. 
Her smile comes on insecure. 
But her eyes, they let you know for sure. 
Oh, you gotta look hard and deep. 
Her kind of lovein', it don't come cheap, no. 
And you can call her Plain Jane 
But she's drivin' me insane. 
My Plain Jane - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're drivin' me insane. Ow!

Love you, love you, love you

Plain Jane - See her walkin' down the street, and I just wanna love you. 
My Plain Jane - Come here baby. 
Plain Jane - Now, come here baby.

Sammy Hagar,"Love's an hourglass
Goes out wide, comes in closer
Time ticks away, it drips away
Leaving empty, sanded shoulders
But who said that love would last forever
I'm growing tired of feeling like I do
All those simple little secrets
Have come between us
And they're pushing me away
And I feel comfort in the distance
And you said that love would last forever
I'm growing tired of feeling like I do
Oh yeah
And there's a time, there's a place
A change of heart, about face
It's about love, it's about forgiveness
It's about our destiny
Tell me now, tell me like it is

And what's done is done for everyone
Come on baby I want to start again
Right now

And I think a lot
Yeah, I've been thinking a lot
I've been thinking about you baby
Lord knows I've been thinking a lot
I've been thinking love should last forever
Been growing tired of feeling like I do

Sammy Hagar,"There's another side to everything
Connected like the ring around your finger
And I know this like I know myself,
Not very well, yet I'm no stranger
But it won't be long, I see both sides now
When nothing's gained, then something's lost
Pay half the price at twice the cost
We're crystallized, we stand alone
Conviction holds us like a stone
I know it won't be long, 'cause I see both sides now
We got to learn how to listen, before we learn to talk
We got to learn how to crawl, befor we learn to walk
If you want a little peace, sometimes you got to fight
We got to walk through the darkness
Before we stand in the light
But I know it won't be long, I see both sides now
We're always somewhere in between
We never taste, the sweet extreme
We're crystallized, we stand alone
Conviction holds us like a stone
I know it won't be long, I see both sides now

Sammy Hagar,"Today, love takes on a whole new meaning
In a face, I know I've seen somewhere before
Somehow, the mystery is over
Yet, just begun
To see the most perfect thig
Together, we've ever done
So what do we call this miracle we've made
And how can I find one word to say it
When all I'm feeling, here and now, is love
So that will always be you

Today, I just wrote a song about you
The words, they flow just like the air I breathe
The closest I've ever been
To truly understanding
The closest we'll ever be
To the meaning of life so sacred
So what do we call this miracle we've made
And how can I find one word to say it
When all I'm feeling, here and now, is love
So that will always be you

And every language has a word
But the meaning is always the same
Love is all you've got, to start out in the world
And love is all that remains

When all I'm feeling, here and now, is love
So that will always be you

Sammy Hagar,"I feel this all came really soon
Like leaving the warmth of the womb
Read my thoughts as I'm hanging there
I wonder is this going to take us anywhere
Why doesn't love take us anywhere
It burns so hot then it disappears
And fear doesn't taste like what it used to be
I felt so all alone
Why don't you hold me some
Hold me some, While I bleed
Yeah
Now my body's got some cross to bear
Every cross has somebody hanging there
Everybody's got their bottom line
Oh bring 'em on down

Sure makes me feel so different

And there's a war out in the streets that no one is winning

Would you do it for pride?

Woud you be satisfied?

I think you better ask yourself
Before you criticize me
Are you a victim of the system
Of the powers that be?
If there was nothing to gain
Would you do it for free?
Would you do it for me?

Ain't no beginning, no end
It seems like every time I think I've arrived

Here among the shadows, beautiful lady, open you heart.
The scene is set, the breezes sing of it,
Can't you get into the swing of it, lady, when do we start?
When the lady is kissable and the evening is cool,
Any dream is permissible in the heart of a fool.

And if I seem over amorous, lady, what can I do?

Southbound",Southbound
Sammy Kershaw,"I can't bear to ask the question
When the answer is goodbye
It only adds to my confusion
When you won't tell me why
And as I sit here on this bar stool
Blind but not naive
I'm probably acting like a fool
But I'm too far gone to leave

Too far, too far gone to leave
But I guess that's what I'll do
I can't keep on believin'
That you love for me is true
And though my heart tells my head to stay
My mind says walk away
I'm way on beyond grief
Too far gone to leave

The years with me and Nick and Christi
Must not mean a thing to you
You just want it over quickly
Without giving us a clue
And as I sit here on this bar stool
With my heart out on my sleeve
I can feel your ridicule
But I'm too far gone to leave

Too far, too far gone to leave
But I guess that's what I'll do
I can't keep on believin'
That you love for me is true
And though my heart tells my head to stay
My mind says walk away
I'm way on beyond grief
Too far gone to leave
I keep hoping for a rerieve

Sammy Kershaw,"I got you under my skin a long time ago:
Just a little tattoo to let the world know
That there'd never be no one for me but you.
But you turned out to be a bad heartache,
And I found someone to take your place.
Now, what am I gonna do with your tattoo?

Well, it won't wash off or fade away,
And I'm stuck with you till my dying day.
It's just a picture of a girl in her birthday suit,
With her cowboy hat and her cowboy boots.
I can go to the man, and have him erase,
Or have him put a moustache on your face.
Now, what am I gonna do with your tattoo?

When my baby sees you, she starts to cry.
When I tell her I love her, she says it's a lie,
'Cause she thinks you're the one that I'm dreamin' of.
Then she gets mad at me and pounds on you
Until my arm turns black and blue.
Now, what am I gonna do with your tattoo?

[Chorus:]
It won't leave me like you did.
Now, what am I gonna do with your tattoo?",Your Tattoo
Sammy Kershaw,"I gave a girl a ride in my wagon
She crawled in and took control
She was tired as her mind was a-draggin'
I said get some sleep and we'll get on down the road

Like a picture she was layin' there
Moonlight dancin' off her hair
She woke up and took me by the hand
She's gonna love me in my Chevy van
And that's all right with me

Her young face was like that of an angel
And her long legs were tanned and brown
Better keep your eyes on the road, son
Better slow this ve-hicle down

'Cause like a picture she was layin' there
Moonlight dancin' off her hair
She woke up and took me by the hand
She's gonna love me in my Chevy van
And that's all right with me

I put her out in a town that was so small
You could throw a rock from end to end
A dirt-road Main Street
She walked off in her bare feet
It's a shame I won't be passin' through again

Like a picture she was layin' there
Moonlight dancin' off her hair
She woke up and took me by the hand
We made love in my Chevy van
And that's all right with me

No more games for me girl I'm fit to be tied down

I've lost at love, got some bruises
But the heart that don't give up
Never really loses
Since I met you
It don't make sense to keep on playing around
Anyone can see you've got me
Fit to be tied down

Tie me down, wrap me up in forever
I've found something sweet in surrendering now
Take me off this merry go round
Going round in circles has got me nowhere
But a love like yours is really so rare
And I'm amazed at the treasure I've finally found
I'm on bended knee

Sammy Kershaw,"There's a white mark on my hand
Where I wore our wedding band
Had to force myself to lay it down
So I put it in my drawer
Just can't wear that ring no more
I've carried it around for years

There's a picture that I've had
In my wallet hid in back
The one I like the best of me and you
Gonna take it out today
And make myself throw it away
I've carried it around for years

Clean the shelves and sweep the floors
Hide things in the back of drawers
Take down the curtains that you made
Birthday cards and valentines
Everything you ever signed
Take 'em all and throw 'em all away

Clean the shelves and sweep the floors
Hide things in the back of drawers
Take down the curtains that you made
But some things you can't put down
Like the way I love you sounds
I'll carry that around for years

She's you all over again
Although you went away

And I used to send up a prayer
To Heaven where I know you are

Were the pieces of her broken heart
I gathered up the pieces I found
Put her back together like a busted guitar
But some glues hold and some glues don't
In spite of everything I've tried
Somebody stole my darlin', Lord
Right before my very eyes

[Chorus]
He didn't walk, talk, push his way in
Fly through the window on a gust of hot wind
He didn't sprout wings
And he sure wasn't playing no harp
Low as he was, I couldn't see him
Slithering around in the dark
Lord, he must have crawled through
A little bitty crack in her heart 

Copin' with gone and hoping I'm wrong
But I sure see a definite change
There's a look in her eyes that's sayin' goodbye
And her snuggle when I hold her don't feel the same
The way her heart beats for the sneaky thief
You picture him dark and tall
But the feller that stole my darlin', Lord
He has to be very small

[Chorus]

Low as he was, I couldn't see him
Slitherin' around in the dark

I lit your cigarette and then you wrote your number down
On the inside of a matchbook that was laying on the bar
And a fire started burning somewhere in my heart

I didn't see it coming, guess I didn't read the signs
I just never thought you'd leave me after all this time
But today when I came home my key was hollow in the door
And there was nothing but a worn out book of matches on the floor

You took the bed
You took the dishes and the car
You broke my trust
You took advantage of my heart
You left me here
With empty rooms and walls with holes and scars and scratches
If I find the strength to burn you memories down
At least you left the matches

The color's old and faded the cover's worn and stained
But i can still make out the numbers and the heart beside your name
Until tonight they'd only lit a single cigarette
Now one by one I'm striking them to help me to forget

And everybody at the broken spoke
All thought my crazy story was a joke
Now they're out there in the parking lot
Staring at the smoke

You took the bed
You took the dishes and the car
You broke my trust
You took advantage of my heart
You left me here
With empty rooms and walls with holes and scars and scratches
And the hurt I need to burn those memories down
At least you left the matches

And life on the big city streets
It's folks talking on the corner, and gabbing on the steps
When I think about it all, well I'd much rather be

Shootin' the bull in an old cowtown
Watching grass grow as the sun goes down 
While life goes by at a much slower pace
Than the speed of sound

Ever since you left I guess
And the grass outside needs mowin'

But I don't even care at all
And I don't know where I'm goin'

Thank God you're gone
So you don't see me fall apart
Pickin' up the pieces of my shattered, broken heart
When you left me my world came down
It's a good thing you're not around
To see I'm really not that strong
Thank God you're gone

They took all my things today
Even hauled my truck away
And the vines died that grew our roses
Don't know if it will ever end
Seems like I can't find a friend
I find a door and it just closes

The rest of my life, do I want you there

Will I always be true, would I die for you

Do they have a way to count the stars
There's a lot of scientific minds
That claim to know what all the answers are
Well if that's the case

How much does the world weigh
Somebody's probably worked it out
You can look up what the experts say
But all you gotta do is look around
You'd be surprised who knows

Ask that woman tryin' to make the rent
And pay the bills and feed the kids
Six months ago their daddy walked away
Ask that man whose family stayed around
'Cause he finally put that bottle down
Now he has to fight that battle every day
Hey, how much does the world weigh

Human spirit is a funny thing
How far it bends before it breaks
To keep the world from caving in
How much strength does it take
Well don't ask me

Ask that couple in the waiting room
The doctors say it's still too soon
It's their little girl, all they can do is pray
Ask that little boy who's gotta choose
Mom or Dad, either way he'll lose
They're breakin' up and he thinks he's to blame
Hey, how much does the world weigh

Ask that man hangin' on the cross
His last breath will save the lost
The answer's in the tears on his face

And when I got sacked I'd flash a grin

'Cause I didn't feel a thing
Then one day I saw your face

Ache all over from your tender touch
You say my name, and I get goosebumps
Well, baby, this former man-of-steel is putty in your hands
And I love this feeling

Cryin' uncle; it's no contest
It's all your fault I fell in love

I told him what I wanted him to give me

Sammy Kershaw,"Well, we're big rock singers, we got golden fingers and we're loved everywhere we go (That sounds like us)
We sing about beauty and we sing about truth at ten thousand dollars a show (Right)
We take all kinds of pills, that give us all kind of thrills but the thrill we've never known
Is the thrill that'll get you when you get your picture on the cover of The Rolling Stone

Wanna buy five copies for my mother (Yeah!)
Wanna see my smilin' face, on the cover of The Rolling Stone

I got a freaky old lady name o' Cocaine Kitty who embroiders on my jeans
I got my poor ol' grey haired daddy, drivin' my limousine

We got a lot of little teenage blue eyed groupies who'll do anything we say
We got a genuine Indian guru, who's teachin' us a better way
We got all the friends, that money can buy, so we'll never have to be alone
And we keep gettin' richer but we can't get our picture on the cover of The Rolling Stone

Sammy Kershaw,"I get angry every time someone mentions her name
I get frightening mad she's gone, 'cause I know who's to blame
I get worked up thinking 'bout the hurting words I said
I get so fed up that I see red

[Chorus]
I see red eyes cry, I quit, goodbye on red lips
Me begging her to stay
I see red hair and a red scarf, red dress and a red car
Driving away

I see everything wrong that I did
I see red

Looking 'round this lonely house, and all I threw away
Makes me so mad at myself, sometimes I can't see straight
Trying to forgive myself is worse than trying to forget
Can't do either one, I just see red

Sammy Kershaw,"She was sitting at our table
In our favourite old cafe
(?) up, laughing with new friends

It was the first time I had seen her
Since the day she walked away
She noticed me the moment I walked in

I saw her brown eyes and perfect smile
The candle light reflecting off her hair
But she acted like I wasn't even there

In California, sun sinking out of sight
Like I didn't hear her say ""I love you""
Laying on the beach that night

Like I wasn't standing in that cafe
Losing her all over again
All I could do was stare
While she acted like I wasn't even there

I thought I might walk over
Then she'd have to say ""hello""
But then again, just what good would that do?

So I motioned to the waitress
""I'll take a call for you to go
And keep that change, I'll try to play it cool""

Then I heard that voice above the crowd
I felt like I was trying to breath thin air
And she acted like I wasn't even there

In the rock with that diamond in my hand
Like we didn't talk about forever
A picket fence on a little land

Like I wasn't standing in that cafe
Losing her all over again
All I could do was stare
While she acted like I wasn't even there

Surely I'm still in her heart somewhere
But she acted like I wasn't even there",Like I Wasn't Even There
Sammy Kershaw,"I'm looking like a lobster wearing flip-flops and a Stetson
Guess that's why they call it fishing instead of catching
'Cause I ain't had a single bite all day
But I caught a buzz and there ain't no limit on tang ray

Ain't quite sure how I wound up way down here
It's a long haul to ropes and sails from roping steers
Ain't gonna worry about that, just gonna have some fun
Gotta be one fish down there dumber than I am drunk

[Chorus]
It ain't that far from Waco to Galveston
I'm what you get when you mix a Prairie dog and an old beach bum
Cow chips, B-S and ships ahoy
I'm a saltwater cowboy

There's a tiki party down the beach about a mile or so
Where they're singing with Jimmy and toasting to Chris LeDoux
And if it weren't for Captain Morgan steering this ship
I might untie that rope and back her on up outta this

If this bottle goes overboard, you'd better wish me luck
Well I'm afraid of sharks, but I'm terrified of sobering up

Sammy Kershaw,"There are a lot of perfect reasons
To never fight another war
There are a lot of perfect questions
As to what's worth fighting for
There are a lot of perfect fools
Who refuse to read the writing on the wall

But the truth is there are people
Who've made it crystal clear
That it is their holy mission
To destroy all we hold dear
They are visibly out searching for the fire
To make this towing nation fall

Now we can just sit back and wait
Until they spill more precious blood
Or we can seek these cowards out
And nip their slaughter in the bud

Audios sweet home and family
I'm off to fight a war that must be won
You'll know why I'm going when you see
The snow white rows of Arlington

Every blade of grass is sacred
Every headstone is a shrine
To somebody who was willing
To put existence on the line

The liberty we take for granted
Was purchased with their patriotic lives

Are their sleeping spirits restless?
Do they listen for the sound?
Of the mustering of armies
To defend their hallowed ground?
Will we rise to the occasion
To ensure their legacy survives?

Through the willows blow soft breezes
They are whispering my name
Asking did they die for nothing?
Aren't I the keeper of the flame?

Audios sweet home and family
Wave goodbye to your Louisiana son
You will know why I'm leaving when you see
The snow white rows of Arlington

Wave goodbye to your Louisiana son

Just reminising from out of the blue

But I'll bet your baby sees it different than you

Everything you do means a whole lot
More than it might mean to you.
Through the eyes of a woman

Sammy Kershaw,"I almost didn't make it
Boys, I risk life and limb
It was plain to see that my wife
Was in that honey-do mood again

Well buddy, that ain't nothing
I barely made it out the door
She was prayin' and a-cussin'
Like she was 'bout to wage a holy war

Mine got so mad, she was bitin' her lip
She turned her head and I gave her the slip

Now we're all in the same boat
Pass me a beer and a fishing pole
Let's find a spot and drop that anchor down
We're really livin' the high life
And blue skies
We left all our worries back in town
We're all in the same boat now

Did you see the one I just missed?
Hey I bet he weighed six pounds
And by the way I thought you said you wore
The breeches in your house

She don't run my life
I do as I please
And that minnow you couldn't seem to land
Didn't look that big to me

You boys are good actin' tellin' them tales
But truth be known, we know damn well

That we're all in the same boat
Pass me a beer and tell a good joke
Let's find a spot and drop that anchor down
We're really livin' the high life
And blue skies
We left all our worries back in town
We're all in the same boat now

It's time to go and your hands are shaking
Don't think I didn't see your knees are waking
We're gonna need some luck cause we all know

Sammy Kershaw,"He'd say can't never could do nothin'
And weights what broke the wagon
There ain't no fence between right or wrong
Sometimes you gotta fight if you wanna get along
You better stand up when that flag gets raised
Or down on your knees when it's time to pray
But the greatest thing about him to me
Was the fact that he believed

[Chorus]
He believed in the good Lord above
A straight shootin' rifle, and the power of love
He believed in why the blood was shed
And if he couldn't be free, he'd rather be dead
And to never give up on your dreams
But most of all, yeah, most of all he believed in me

Well, he had his own opinion
About the world and its condition
Spare the rod, spoil the child
You'll reap what you sow if you let it grow wild
You just gotta deal with the hand you're dealt
Never give up, and you'll never really fail
But the greatest thing about dad to me
Was the fact that he believed

And just because of that I know where he's gone to stay

Sammy Kershaw,"She was a woman on a mission
Here to drown him and forget him
So I set her up again to wash him down
She has just about succeed
With that low-down, no good cheating
Good for nothing, came strutting through the crowd
Oh he was laying it on so thick
He never missed a lick
Professing his never-ending love
Oh but I never will forget
When she stood up and said
""So I guess you think we are just gonna kiss and make up don't ya?""

That's when she said

Why don't you kiss, kiss this!
And I don't mean on my rosy red lips
And me and you
(Me and you)
We're through
(We're through)
And there's only one thing left for you to do
You just come on over hereon last time
Pucker up and close your eyes
And kiss this, goodbye

Well,the next thing I recall
She had him back against the wall
Chewing him like a bulldog on a bone
She was putting him in his place
I mean right up in his face
Dragging him down a list of done did wrongs
It was just about now
That the crowd gathered around
They come to watch him pay for his every sin
She called him everything under the sun
And when we thought she was done
She rared back and she let him have it again, MAN

She said...she said

Why don't you kiss, kiss this!
And I don't mean on my rosy red lips

Of a lonely house that once was home sweet home
I have nothing here to sell you
Just some things that I will tell you
Some things I know will chill you to the bone

Over there sits the chair
Where she'd bring the paper to me
And sit down on my knee and whisper oh I love you
But now she's gone forever
And this old house will never be the same
Without the love that we once knew

Straight ahead that's the bed
Where we lay and love together
And Lord knows we had a good thing going here
See her picture on the table
Don't it look like she'd be able
Just to touch me and say good morning dear

There's her rings, all her things
And her clothes are in the closet

But I've a little song that I will sing to you
It's gonna win you through and through
There ain't much to the words but the music is grand
And you'll be a-singing it to beat the band
You've heard of the tisket and tasket it's true
But give a little listen to this will you?

It's so soothing and appealing to me
It goes Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da
Jing, Jing, Jing
 
Our bands have been digging back for tunes to be sung
Operas and nursery rhymes have been overdone
I dug a little deeper and I found this thing
It's ragtime but it still can swing
It ain't a turkeytrot or a shimmey onestep
But when grandma danced to it
She thought she was hep
It still is a ditty 
I'm sure you will find
Will keep a runnin' 'round and around your mind

On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Sammy Sherman,"'t was on the Isle of Capri that I found her 
Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree 
Oh, I can still see the flowers blooming round her 
Where we met on the Isle of Capri 

She was as sweet as a rose at the dawning 
But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me 
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning 
Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri 

Summertime was nearly over 
Blue Italian sky above 
I said ""Lady, I'm a rover, 
Can you spare a sweet word of love?"" 

She whispered softly ""It's best not to linger"" 
And then as I kissed her hand I could see 
She wore a lovely meatball on her finger 
't was goodbye at the villa Capri

Sammy Sherman,"Just picture a penthouse way up in the sky
With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by
A sweet slice of Heaven for just you and I
When we're alone.

From all of society we'll stay aloof
And live in propriety there on the roof.
Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth
When we're alone.

We'll see life's mad pattern
As we view old Manhattan
Then we can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are.

In our little penthouse we'll always contrive
To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive,
When we're alone.

These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Samson,"Here I stand, I believe it's true
Running out, light's running out on you
Witnesses we are all together
Preacher's son waits for heavy weather

Bloodlust I'm letting go

Alone a lion waits for you
Cry for forgiveness for what I am about to do
Years ago I began to fall
But, now you're here I'll end it all and cry

Got me here again, waiting for a sign
Raising my hands to the sky
The rain will fall and end it all someday
But until then I'll wait on my mountain and pray
I knew!",Blood Lust

Samson Trinh,"Joan was quizzical; studied pataphysical
Science in the home.
Late nights all alone with a test tube.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine,
Calls her on the phone.
""Can I take you out to the pictures,
Joa, oa, oa, oan?""

But as she's getting ready to go,
A knock comes on the door.

Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head.
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead.

Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again.
Teacher gets annoyed.
Wishing to avoid and unpleasant
Sce, e, e, ene,

She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away,
So he waits behind
Writing fifty times ""I must not be
So, o, o, o""

But when she turns her back on the boy,
He creeps up from behind.

Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head.
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead.

P. C. Thirty-one said, ""We caught a dirty one.""
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

Rose and Valerie, screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free
(Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them
So, o, o, o.

But as the words are leaving his lips,
A noise comes from behind.

Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head.
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead.

Whoa, oh, oh, oh.

Samson Trinh,"Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

His sister Pam works in a shop
She never stops, she's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man",Mean Mr. Mustard
