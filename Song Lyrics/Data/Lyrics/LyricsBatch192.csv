Jes,"You might be the only thing I ever think about
You might be the only one I ever talk about
And you are everything I thought I'd live without
But now you're the only thing I ever really think about

And it's too late
To turn back now
And it's too late
To turn back now
Lift me up
'Cause it's a long way down
And it's too late
To turn back now

I might be the only thing you never care about
I was everything I never thought you'd live without
Now I'm the only one you never really think about

And it's too late
To turn back now
And it's too late
To turn back now
Lift me up
'Cause it's a long way down
And it's too late
To turn back now

Where do we go from here?
Love will make it right

You might be the only thing I ever think about

It's too late
To turn back now
It's too late
To turn back now
Lift me up
'Cause it's a long way down
And it's too late
To turn back now

You might be the only thing I ever think about",It's Too Late
Jes,"Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again

Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again

However far away
I will always love you
However long I stay
I will always love you
Whatever words I say
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you

Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again

However far away
I will always love you
However long I stay
I will always love you
Whatever words I say
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you",Lovesong
Jesca Hoop,"Stolen crown, pillow down
All tangled in my head
Evening gown, the lights downtown
All dangle in the air

Gates of heaven open, there is me
On the silverscreen
I hope they did good editing

Belle and Beau, buck and doe
A love of tender age
Jill and Joe, do-si-do
A tragedy on stage

Gates of heaven open, there is me
On the silverscreen
I hope they did good editing

Bye, bye, baby, bye, bye
Hello to my beautiful mind, bye, bye
Bye, bye, baby, bye, bye
Hello to my beautiful mind, bye, bye

Bye, bye, baby, bye, bye, bye, bye
Hello to my beautiful mind, bye, bye
Bye, bye, baby, bye, bye
Hello to my beautiful mind

Crystal ball, padded wall
A bright blue TV glare
A moth to light is as lost as I'm found
Fall cellar stairs

Gates of heaven open, there is me
On the silverscreen
I hope they did good editing

Bye, bye, baby, bye, bye
Bye, bye, baby, bye, bye
Bye, bye, baby, bye, bye
Bye, bye, baby, bye, bye

Jesca Hoop,"And the tall trees all have fell down
And they scattered seeds on the ground
And one is lost and one is found
Water is moving underground

When I was a young girl
I would sleep in a tall tree
On the down of bending boughs
And from the mount of his shoulders
I would traverse the valleys
Through his dusk and dawning eyes

""I will let you in,"" says the doe to my arrow
""and you will wear my bones and my skin""
Hunting my dress
Love is ruthless

And in the nest from the forest
I would carry an ember
And with a burning heart we'd walk
And when he asks me to rest with him
I would lay down my fire
And in that heart we'd sing and talk

I am a racoon
And you are an owl
I will run from you in the middle of the night
And we will stike a truce in the the billowing tower
And we'll eclipse the moon with a fire light
Hunting my dress
Love is ruthless

You love me in my dreams
It's easier when I'm fast asleep
But I don't want you to come to me anymore
The river bed has married me
So I don't want you to come to me anymore

And out of ashes comes morning
And the ritual of bathing
In the pools at bridal falls
And from the mouth of my lover
I will drink of the river
And kiss his jade and marble walls

You have spilled the red from my heart with your arrow
And you will make my bed under the red grass
And I will give my flesh and my blood and my marrow
And you will wear my bones and my skin
Hunting my dress
Love is ruthless

And the tall trees all fell down
And they scattered seeds on the ground
One is lost and one is found
Water is moving underground

And you're the one who showed to me the sky
It's so much more than you and I
And darling I wish I had the time
The river is whispering goodbye
Bye
Bye",Hunting My Dress
Jesca Hoop,"I will walk the road as long as the road goes
I will try to dodge the rock the valley throws
Revealer, caught a fever
We all have a sinking stone

And when the road presents a twisting case of fate
A meaner eye you need to contemplate
The season comes with a reason
We all have a setting sun

Distance, mark of distance
Your burden is your brilliance
There's a vessel, a hidden vessel in the stone

Difference, not indifference
Your passion marks you different
And you wrestle, and how you wrestle to come to know

The whispering light
The truth is awful quiet
Like it's whispering at night
Can tell you how to
Break the fever
With light
The truth is awful quiet
Like whispering in light
Can tell you how to

And light is less and light is more in some
For don't confuse the weather for the sun
Revealer, magic healer
And when will your vision come

And lightning rods will guide your journey home
And revelations from a fist of bones
And when the rock weighs heavy in your soul
Just tell her that you have earned the right to know

Revealer, how to break the fever
You carried in, like these demons your kin
And you'll render it secret then

Distance, mark of distance
Your burden is your brilliance
There's a vessel, a hidden vessel in the stone

Difference, not indifference
Your passion sparks resilience
And you wrestle, and how you wrestle to come to know

The whispering light
The truth is awful quiet
Like it's whispering at night
Can tell you how to
Break the fever
With light
The truth is awful quiet
Whispering at light
Can tell you how to
Break the fever
With light
The truth is awful quiet
Whispering at light
Can tell you how to...",Whispering Light

Jesper Thilo,"You stepped out of a dream
You are too wonderful to be what you seem!
Could there be eyes like yours, 
Could there be lips like yours
Could there be smiles like yours, 
Honest and truly?
You stepped out of a cloud
I want to take you away, away from the crowd
And have you all to myself, 
Alone and apart out of a dream, 
Safe in my heart

Jesper Thilo,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Jesper Thilo,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

Jesper Thilo,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me.

Oh lady be good to me.","Oh, Lady Be Good"
Jesper Thilo,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

Jesper Thilo,"Whether you are here or yonder, 
Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander,

Even though you don't succeed

Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind

With the sun in my heart

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep

To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step

Jesper Thilo,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows

Jess and Gabriel,"I set out on a narrow way many years ago
Hoping I would find true love along the broken road
But I got lost a time or two
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through

I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you

Every long lost dream lead me to where you are
Others who broke my heart, they were like northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms

This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you

I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you

Jess and Gabriel,"In the morning when you wake up
I like to believe you are thinking of me
And when the sun comes through your window
I like to believe you've been dreaming of me

Dreaming mmm mmm

I know
'cause I'd spend half this morning
Thinking about the t-shirt you sleep in

I should know
'cause I'd spend all the whole day
Listening to your message I'm keeping and never deleting

When I saw you,
Everyone knew
I liked the effect that you had on my eyes

But no one else heard
The weight of your words
Or felt the effect that they have on my mind

Falling mmm mmm

I don't want to lead you on
I don't want to hold you back

I would rather hurt myself
Than to ever make you cry
There's nothing left to say but good-bye
You deserve the chance at the kind of love
I'm not sure I'm worthy of
Losing you is painful to me

Says baby you failed me
If your love is really true
Why don't I feel set free

Aw bail me out baby

How could I know he brought it on himself

I tried
So I bailed him out with all my cash
I bailed him out with my love

I even pulled the warden over to one side
I said leave for him to foreswear my penance 
For his crime

How could I fail at freeing only one man from his own cage

And though it hurts to think of him
Cursing me for one thing
And it hurts to think of me
No longer believing

But in the end they told me
Sorry he isn't good enough
And it finally occurred to me
Why his life is so damn rough

I hate to see that evening sun go down

If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea

Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues

Todo por tratar de demostrar
Olvide que sin tu amor

Tengo la esperanza que el dolor
Cambie y se transforme en tu perdón
Navegar en un mar sin fantasmas
Y la luz de tu amor sea mi mapa

Juro que es verdad no miento
Que mi voluntad es cambiar
Pero sola yo no puedo
No se como lograr, mi alma reparar

Jesse & Joy,"Se mira en el espejo, sin gustarle lo que encuentra 
Ella quiere hacer notar

Será Ella esclava de lo que La gente de Ella piensa

Cierra los ojos e ver tu belleza interior 
No tengas miedo de ser el tesoro que escondes hoy 
Oh oh oh. oh oh oh 
Perfecta te hizo Dios 

Ahora vive, siente, acepta 
Todo lo que te rodea 
E aprende a amar-te por tu ser 
E no por tu apariencia 
Que una bascula no es 
La que da felicidad 

Cierra los ojos e ver tu belleza interior 
No tengas miedo de ser el tesoro que escondes hoy

Otro día
Misma feria
Y no he dormido nada
Pa' variar

Puro taxi ocupado
Miro al cielo esta nublado
Yo con prisa y sin bocado
Y Murphy me ha burlado
Una vez mas

Aquí voy
De malas pero voy
Haciendo malabares pa' pagar la renta de hoy
Que venga mas
Yo aguanto mucho mas
Cansada con hambre
De buenas o malas
Yo llego hasta el final

Y si, resulta que si
Que ahora cantan
Tan afinaditos

¿Y que pasa si yo
Olvido el tono
De esta canción?
¿Me querrías todavía o
Cambiarías la estación?

Aquí voy
Algo insegura pero voy
Haciendo malabares
Pa' pagar la renta de hoy
Que venga mas
Yo aguanto eso y mas
Perdida, afinada
Aunque desubicada
Yo llego hasta el final

Y si me olvido de la letra
Yo lo arreglo con un

(pa pa pa, papa, parara)

Todo mundo mira en el espejo
No les gusta su reflejo
Y no les queda nada mas
Que criticar a los demás

¿Y que pasa si hoy
Buscamos un poco
De comprensión?

Por lo que resta de este día
No habría discriminación

Ingenua pero voy

Jesse & Joy,"Me perdí, caminando por madrid
Contando estrellas en parís
Cenando en nueva york

Confundí, viviendo en lo superficial,
Los sueños con la realidad,
Pero mi alma despertó.

Y luego vi una luz brillante
Que desde lejos me dijo ven
Eran tus ojos como diamantes
Y en ese instante yo supe que

Eres mi tesoro.
Cada segundo me enamoro más,
Si a mi lado estás,
Lo tengo todo,
Es suficiente con los ricos besos
Que tú me das.

Eres mi tesoro.
Cada segundo me enamoro más,
Si a mi lado estás,
Lo tengo todo,
Es suficiente con los ricos besos
Que tú me das.

¡eres mi tesoro!

Solo así
Perdiendo todo comprendi
Que no tenía valor sin ti
Mi pobre corazón
Descubrí
Que vale más el interior
Y brilla un poco más que el sol
Si tengo de tu amor

Y fuiste tu esa luz brillante
Que desde lejos me dijo ven
Con esos ojos como diamante
Y en ese instante yo supe que

Eres mi tesoro
Cada segundo me enamoro más,
Se a mi lado estás
Lo tengo todo
Es suficiente con los ricos besos
Que tu me das

Eres mi tesoro
Cada segundo me enamoro mas
Se a mi lado estás
Lo tengo todo
Es suficiente con tus ricos besos
Que tu me das
Eres mi tesoro

Eres mi tesoro.
Cada segundo me enamoro más,
Si a mi lado estás,
Lo tengo todo,
Es suficiente con los ricos besos
Que tú me das.

Eres mi tesoro.

Jesse & Joy,"Ya me es imposible distinguir este dolor
Con año noche y día a debilitado el corazón
La piel pegada al hueso y la semilla de un amor
Creciendo en esa herida recordando tu sabor

Tu mi poesía alimentame la inspiración
Vuelve a mi vida y vitaminame el corazón
Que mi mundo esta muriendo poco a poco
Sin ti

Quiero que comprendas que sin ti yo no soy yo
Con cero pensamiento y un aviso en mi interior
Sin ti la luz que enciendo lo que en mi se apago
Mi alma se atormenta porque alguien la dejo

Tu mi poesía alimentame la inspiración
Vuelve a mi vida y vitaminame el corazón
Que mi mundo esta muriendo poco a poco
Sin ti

Tu mi poesía alimentame la inspiración

Sin dejarte de pensar
Sigue tu huella en mi almohada

Veo tu rostro frente a mi
Siento que aún estás aqui
Todo mi cuerpo te extraña

Puedo ver tu sombra en la luna
Cuando mi memoria te alumbra

Ya están desgastadas
Todas las palabras
Lo que queda entre tú y yo
No le alcanza al corazón

Y desde mi pecho
Suena tu recuerdo
Todo lo que fue de los dos
Son ecos de amor
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Estoy perdiendo la razón
Me hablas en cualquier canción
Tu nombre está en cada palabra

Estás tan cerca y tan lejos
Me aferro sólo a un reflejo
Te pierdo

No le alcanza el corazón

Y desde mi pecho
Suena tu recuerdo

Suenan tanto y no me puedo acostumbrar

Y no deberías haberme tentado, te gusta jugar

Pero que yo nunca te imaginé mi estrellita ay así en este plan
Pero yo a ti te conozco y sé por dónde vas

Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to used to used to used to, now I'm over that

It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me started a symphony

About a nest set apart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony

What else could I do again
Keep repeating through again
""I love you, love you""

I still recall the thrill, guess I always will
I hope 'twill never depart

Tummyacher girl in the city
I never knew a drop dead beauty like you
I never knew how fast my heart would beat or what to do
You took me out of the park 'cause you were such a heavy hitter

You dressed me up, and then you wore me all around town
We was the latest trash fashion, was the word going down
But like the rag that I was, you broke my heart just
'Cause I was cheap shoppin' on a junk heap

Break it, ah, no, no, no, no
Just break it, ah no, no, no
I know you break it

Look, you break every heart in this town
Oh, you mess us all around

Heartbroken, croakin', lookin' for a kiss
I was turnin' it out but you were just turn 'n' tricks
Left your marks all around
I even heard you was with my guitar player
I'm a seein' her later so

Break it, ah no, no, no, no, no
Just break it, ah no, no, no, no
I know you break it

So now you've been a slummin' it with all us 8th Street Kidz
Going through our garbage cans and flippin' all our lids
But you've been messin' with punks, we'll stink you up like skunks
So go back sweetie and mistreat Cory and Petie
Or whatever else punk you're with

Break it, ah no, no, no
Just break it, ah no, no, no
I know you break it

We ain't gonna make it to school this mornin'
We missed the bus
So we better hitch with Stitch's

I know you only get 16 sick days
We're up to 22 just livin' in a daze
I'll get Susie to write us up a note
That'll get us out I know it's gotta float

I'll see you around

If things get too tight I'll say
""Yo, teach, I got to go see the school shrink""
I'll act all crazy then you stash them pills
Them that make us think

Grab some condoms too 'cause Susie's gettin' loose
I'd rather neck in the woods than listen to all of you

Tell her I left class 'cause I was feelin' kinda down then laugh

I'll see you around
So goodbye teachers
I'll see you around

I'll see you around

What do ya mean? I'm supposed to be in class
Go back to class, I am in class
No, I did not just join the girls volleyball team

No, we're just working on our chemistry

Jesse Camp,"We made a pact that we would never look back
We tried to make it down the coast on our own
In a borrowed car between the seats and the stars
We learned some things I wished we'd never ever known

Just another hard luck story on a cold winter night
But you ain't got no coat, so I just hold you tight

So wrap your arms around me, baby
Don't say you wanna turn around and go home
If you stay with me, baby
I'll fulfill all of your wishes with my big ol' sloppy kisses

I know that Daytona is still days away
I know I promised I'd get us there by now
Still we're crashed out in another truck stop parking lot
I swear I'll hustle us a hotel

So our hard luck story lasts another night
Ain't no way you're gonna freeze when I hold you tight

So wrap your arms around me, baby
Don't say you wanna turn around and go home

I'm gonna slobber all over ya, so hold me tight

Can't get a new pair until I've pad all of my dues
My cowboy boots have gotten too many holes
From getting kicked in the shins and stompin' out

But it's too far to heaven, can't hitch a free ride
Angels don't pick up losers so down on their pride
Still I stick out my thumb and I hope there's a chance
'Cause I can't coast on my looks and fake more romance

'Cause I don't want to take you down
Break you down and shake you down
I don't want to bring you up, just to leave you low
And break you down so down so down

I wasn't born no damaged goods
Just too the wrong road inward to a place all alone
Sure, I can pick out a new name
And I can wear some new clothes
Just can't change the ending of how my story goes

I don't want to take you down
Break you down and shake you down
I don't want to bring you up, just to leave you low and
Break you down so down so down

But things won't get better till I change 'em my own
Admit what I've done, unstitch what I've sewn

And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust

When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares

My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you

Look at the time you've killed

There is a world that you never see
There is a seed we sow
With just a weed that grows

These are the plans of yesterday
This is the love that will never go away

Hiding under your straw hat
You were cold and told me never ever

Raised on rivalry and rock 'n' roll
Moving to the Motor City soul

On the radio

But we loved those kids
Some say that she missed the boat
But she just burned the bridge

Raised on robbery and rock 'n' roll
Moving to the Motor City soul

And books we never read
Well I was hoping one day
We might meet again

She used to talk about astrology
She was born in June
She danced with strangers and celebrities
Empty stars and the full moon

I was thinking about the universe
For what its worth
Or the one about the Phoenix bird
That died and then returned

Jesse McCartney,"Eh eh eh
Eh eh eh

I met this girl down the block from me
Used to tell myself
She was too hot for me
But then I saw her
At the corner store
So I ran on over
Just to grab the door

I got her number
We started chillin'
We started buzzin'
And got addicted
Now I, I'm the one she can't live without
I bet that's her right now

Shorty hitting me up
Says she wanna re-up
Knows I got the best in town
'Cause when she get the shivers
She knows that I deliver
I'm the one who holds her down

She's about to break
Break, break, break, break
And I won't let her wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait

It's gettin' kinda late
Late, late, late, late
And she just want to shake
Shake, shake, shake, shake!

One day she started texting me
Asking if she could borrow that recipe
I told her, loving you is my specialty
She said, well, give it up, up, give it up, up

When she's away, it's such a downer
And I, miss her evey time I'm not around her
'Cause she, she's the one I can't live without
I hope that's her right now

Shorty hitting me up
Says she wanna re-up
Knows I got the best in town
'Cause when she get the shivers
She knows that I deliver
I'm the one who holds her down

She's about to break
Break, break, break, break
And I won't let her wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait

It's gettin' kinda late
Late, late, late, late
And she just want to shake
Shake, shake, shake, shake!

I'm hooked on her
Must admit it
I'd do, I'd do anything to get her
She's hooked on me
I'm bad habit
She'd do, She'd do anything to have me
When she calls, I know
Exactly what she wants from me
Every time I hear my phone ringing
She wants to shake it with me

Shorty hitting me up
Says she wanna re-up
Knows I got the best in town
'Cause when she get the shivers
She knows that I deliver
I'm the one who holds her down

She's about to break
Break, break, break, break
And I won't let her wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait

It's gettin' kinda late
Late, late, late, late
And she just want to shake
Shake, shake, shake, shake!",Shake
Jesse McCartney,"If I were you I'd be taking it easy
Kick back and relax for a little while
We'll all still be here tomorrow
Take time just to act like a little child
No matter what the world has in store for us
You got the ring that better get off of us
Reach out for a comfortable chair
Rejoice and throw your arms in the air

[Chorus]
Cause it's a good life so why y'all trippin'
The good life slippin' away

If you're boss is giving you pressure
Let go, take a breather in the park
You've got to find out what's your pleasure
In time you'll be singing like a lark
Pretty soon your sorry will chime for all
Somebody will heed your call
Reach out for a comfortable chair
Rejoice, throw your arms in the air

[Chorus]

Trade in some misery for some tender loving care
Cast aside those cloudy days fuses are all to bear
Make up your mind get a whole new lease on life
Reach out for a comfortable chair
Rejoice throw your arms in the air

Reach out for a comfortable chair
Rejoice throw your arms in the air

Who know they got it goin' on
But nothing's ever a comparison to you
Now can't you see
That you're the only one I really want
And everything I need,
Is everything you do?

Any girl walk by, don't matter
'Cause you're lookin' so much better
Don't ever need to get
Caught up in jealously
She could be a super-model
Every magazine, the cover
She'll never, ever mean a thing to me

She's no you, oh no
You give me more than I could ever want
She's no you, oh no
I'm satisfied with the one I've got
'Cause you're all the girl
That I ever dreamed
She's only a picture on a magazine
She's no you, she's no you

They got a lot of girls
Who dance in all the videos
But I prefer the way you do,
The way you move
You're more than beautiful
And I just want to let you know
That all I ever need
Is what I've got with you

Any girl walk by, don't matter
Every time you're looking better
I think you're perfect
There ain't nothin' I would change
She could be a super-model
Every magazine, the cover
She'll never, ever take my heart away

She's no you, oh no
You give me more than I could ever want
She's no you, oh no
I'm satisfied with the one I've got
'Cause you're all the girl
That I ever dreamed
She's only a picture on a magazine
She's no you, she's no you

No one's ever gonna get to me
Oh, the way you do,
Now baby can't you see,
That you're the one, the only one
Who's ever made me feel this way?

Nothing's ever coming even close
No, no one's ever been comparable to you

I don't want nothin' I don't got
I don't need nothin' but you
I can't get more than you're giving me
Don't stop anything you do
You're all that, all that, and then some
You know what, just what I need
And no girl, no place, nowhere
Could mean a thing to me

She's no you, oh no
You give me more than I could ever want
She's no you, oh no
I'm satisfied with the one I've got
'Cause you're all the girl

And feeling two feet small

Your scent is sweet, like Betty Crocker bakes
I'd love to have my cake and eat it too

Notice you were there
I promise I'll never ever

Cause you're lookin' so much better

Caught up in jealously

She'll never, ever mean a thing to me

She's no you, oh, no
You give me more than I could ever want
She's no you, oh, no
I'm satisfied with the one I've got
Cause you're all the girl
That I ever dreamed
She's only a picture on a magazine
She's no you, she's no you

They got a lotta girls
Who dance in all the videos
But I prefer the way you do,
The way you move
You're more than beautiful
And I just want to let you know
That all I ever need
Is what I've got with you

Any girl walk by, don't matter
Every time you're looking better
I think you're perfect

Who's ever made me feel this way?

Nothings ever coming even close
No one's ever been comparable to you

I don't want nothin' I don't got
I don't need nothin' but you
I can't get more than you're given me
Don't stop anything you do

Jesse McCartney,"She left me hangin' by a thread again
I stood there waiting like a fool for her
I never dreamed that I'd be in this place
But here I am all alone
It's not the first time that she's walked away
Changed all our plans within the blink of an eye
And looking back it's always been the same
But I refused to see it all for what it was

Has anybody ever felt this way
Has anybody been ripped apart
Anybody give everything to the one they love
Am I the only one left behind
Am I the only one who hates goodbyes
God I know this can't go on forever

I wonder if she ever thinks of me
And all the promises she swore to keep
Some nights I lay in bed just burning up
'Cause I know that she's out with someone else

Has anybody ever felt this way
Has anybody been ripped apart
Anybody give everything to the one they love
Am I the only one left behind
Am I the only one who hates goodbyes
God I know this can't go on forever

I was the one who gave up everything for her
When no one would listen I heard every word, oh
It took me so long to see that maybe I am better off alone

Has anybody ever felt this way
Has anybody been ripped apart
Anybody give everything to the one they love
Am I the only one left behind
Am I the only one who hates goodbyes

Raced out the door
Broken
Tried to believe that it wasn't true

That being the life of the party would catch up to you
Your family was waiting and crying for three damn hours

But you took that turn doing eighty-five in a thirty-five

Every time I'm home I pass that road
Driving alone and the street feels cold
Seeing your face yeah it's haunting me
My mind goes crazy tryin' to figure out
Just where you would be four years from now
And what you were thinking when the lights came down
Doctors were trying to save you for three damn hours

Said it ain't worth it babe

You're hanging out with all your friends
I'm ready to make my move
You go before I get the chance
You know you got me trippin'
Thinkin' about you every day and night
But I can't get to know you
You don't know I'm alive

I see you when you're at the beach
And you're loading up the car
I see you when I'm at the concert
When the lights go dark
There's something kinda fun if I ever get the chance
There's only three words I wanna ask

What's your name?
What's your name?
Oh, I really wanna know
You got me goin' crazy
And I want you more and more
Oh, hey
This could be something real
I've gotta let you know the way I feel
What's your name?
What's your name?
Oh, I really wanna know
'Cause every time I get there
It's right before you go
Oh, hey
If only you could see
I wanna get to know you
If you get to know me 

Now wait up
Oh no, don't go away now
Too late 
I missed your name girl
Oh no, don't go please
'Cause I'm the one you need

Oh no, don't go
I've got to 
Tell you
How 'bout I want you
All I need 
Is a chance
Another opportunity to ask

What's your name?
What's your name?
Oh, I really wanna know
You got me goin' crazy
And I want you more and more
Oh, hey
This could be something real
I've gotta let you know the way I feel
What's your name?
What's your name?

Jesse McCartney,"When a star is born
They possess a gift or two
One of them is this
They have the power to make a wish come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no diff'rence who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing

Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you thru
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no diff'rence who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star

Jesse McCartney,"Now don't you even act like you don't wanna get up
You better get out on the dancefloor show me what you got
'Cause I don't even want too much just for y'all to understand
A party ain't a party if I'm not in the party
So I need to see some hands

[Chorus]
All I really need to know
Is that you came to the party to enjoy yourself
You left your stress and your worries
Back at home on the shelf
And let's get freaky hey oh freaky hey oh hey
Freaky hey oh hey freaky hey oh hey freaky freaky

Make sure the DJ puts this song on and turn it up
And keep it movin' all night long till the sun come up

If you let me put it a little into ya
For so long I've been tryin' to get into ya
Let me in your brain I'll be in your heart
I'll be that good thing that you just can't put down

Get up in my canopy
Bring that over here girl and talk to me
While you're on your back I'ma touch you slowly
Keep you paralyzed so you barely move

Feel like I just struck gold you a fantasy
So tell me what's the business babe
Got me about to pop genie in a bottle
Let's make a toast 'cause I'ma cherish you

Now girl it's your turn to take the reins
Now show me what you're gonna do
'Cause girl I got your remedy

[Chorus: x2]

Do it do it do it
Again look at that

Baby your soft skin is every indication to me
That you need me to hold protect you from the cold
And then just sing you to sleep
I got so much left to give but I found a recipient
Yeah I can trust the two of ya
Everything they told me
Right before the sex with me

Now girl it's your turn to take the reins
Now show me what you're gonna do
'Cause girl I got your remedy

[Chorus: x2]

Can't put down girl get down
Help it's too late 'cause it's 'bout to go down
Can't put down girl get down

Jesse McCartney,"We've run out of words we've run out of time
We've run out of reasons, really why we together?
We both know it's over baby bottom line
It's best we don't even talk at all
Don't call me even if I should cross your mind
Hard enough, I don't need to hear your voice on my messages
Let's just call it quits it's probably better so if I'm not returning your calls it's cause

Cause I'm not coming back I'm closing the door
I used to be trippin' over missin' you but I'm not any more
I got the picture phone baby, your picture's gone
Couldn't stand to see your smile every time you dialed

Cause it's over girl you know it's over this time
So when you call I'm pressin' 7 don't wanna hear your messages messages
I'm tryna erase you from my mind
Cause it's over I swear girl it's over this time
So don't keep callin' leavin' messages don't wanna know where you been
Baby cause it's over

I still wake up every morning quarter to ten
Still eat my cereal right at the kitchen table
I can't even remember how long it's been
When your troubles stayed and occupied
Oh, ask about you whenever I come around
I do what I can not to put my business in the streets
Last thing I need is another episode keep conversations short and sweet because

Cause I'm not coming back I'm closing the door
I used to be trippin' over missin' you but I'm not any more
I got the picture phone baby, your picture's gone
Couldn't stand to see your smile every time you dialed

Cause it's over girl you know it's over this time
So when you call I'm pressin' 7 don't wanna hear your messages messages
I'm tryna erase you from my mind
Cause it's over I swear girl it's over this time
So don't keep callin' leavin' messages don't wanna know where you been
Baby cause it's over

You know that it's over when the burnin' and the yearnin' inside your heart ain't there anymore
And you know that you're through when
She don't do to you and move you like the way she moved you before
And you wanna pull her close, but your heart has froze you kiss her but her eyes don't close
Then she goes out of your heart forever and it hurts you but you know that it's better

Girl you know it's over
Girl you know it's over this time
So when you call I'm pressin' 7 don't wanna hear your messages messages
I'm tryna erase you from my mind
Cause it's over I swear girl it's over this time

She said I'd love to love you all through the night

I left your heart hangin'
I can't imagine what that feels like
But that was another place
And that was another time
It's not fair to blame me for all his crimes
Just for a minute give me a chance let me inside
Just for a minute baby just for a moment
Let me prove I'll do things right

Let down your guard
And show me your colors
Don't fight it anymore
Show me you're with me
Open your arms
I'm not like the others
So don't fight it anymore no
What will it take for me to make you see?
I'm not your enemy

If only on day that he left
I wasn't even there
It's become a nightmare but I'll never rest
Till you give your all
I'll take nothing else till I hear happily ever after the end
Just for a minute give me a chance let me inside
Just for a minute baby just for a moment
Let me prove I'll do things right

Let down your guard

Don't fight it anymore
Show me you're with me

How do you expect things to get any better?
If you keep me on the sideline
Don't you know there's a million things I wanna do
But you gotta meet me halfway you gotta try

Everyone is sayin' I need to control
The way I'm acting
The things that I'm doin' ain't good for me

'Cause I know this time I'm really trippin'
I know that it's deeper than what I'm feelin'
And I realize she's bad for my health
But it's too good just to walk away

She's got me in a daze she's got me in a trance
She's got me so thrown tonight no I need to recover

I keep falling back in love
And I know that this girl
She's not the one for me

And I know I'm only makin' it worse
When I let her go then I come on back every time I leave
Every time I leave every time I leave I keep comin' back
Every time I leave every time I leave every time I leave
I keep comin' back every time I leave

When I feel like she's out of that system of hers
Something pulls me in then I return to let her use me
I care not how she do me as long as she's around

In my mind I see that I'm slippin'
But I still can't seem to see the difference
My heart is sayin' yes to go
Body's sayin' no to it
I need to get a grip on this

She's got me in a daze she's got me in a trance
She's got me so thrown tonight no I need to recover

I keep falling back in love

Hey hey hey runnin' away

I had the perfect girl we'd spend together hours everyday
You'd say that I had it made and I was all for the commitment
But then she started wantin' more from me
And my mind began to change suddenly I didn't feel the same
I didn't know what I was doing

I was dodging commitment start but don't finish
My aim was always the same girl I know I been trippin'
I'm confessin' I'm confessin' so baby just hear me out
I'm confessin' I'm confessin' so baby just see me off
I wanna show my heart but I don't know where to start

So I keep runnin'
With real love in my face
Why am I breakin' away
I keep runnin'
So scared of the heartbreak
So scared of makin' mistakes
I keep runnin'
When all I really need is you
All I really need is you
But I keep on runnin' away
Hey hey hey

I caught a second wind of happiness when I met this girl
And then we became the best of friends we went
From half full to half empty I took a detour tryin' to find myself
But I'm on this road again want out of this box I'm in
I made it harder to be with me

I was dodging commitment start but don't finish
My aim was always the same girl I know I been trippin'
I'm confessin' I'm confessin' so baby just hear me out
I'm confessin' I'm confessin' so baby just see me off
I wanna show my heart but I don't know where to start

So I keep runnin'
With real love in my face
Why am I breakin' away
I keep runnin'
So scared of the heartbreak
So scared of makin' mistakes
I keep runnin'
When all I really need is you
All I really need is you
But I keep on runnin' away
Hey hey hey

I'm 'bout to break down baby I'm done
No I can't keep up runnin' this marathon
No need to rest when I already won
And if I got you by my side girl I already won

It's like lookin' for a treasure when it's already mine
It don't make sense don't make sense
No matter how hard I try to define
I'm comin' face to face with myself
I know I don't need don't need no one else
So can somebody tell me where I'm goin'
So can somebody tell me where I'm goin'

I keep runnin'
With real love in my face
Why am I breakin' away
I keep runnin'
So scared of the heartbreak
So scared of makin' mistakes
I keep runnin'
When all I really need is you
All I really need is you
But I keep on runnin' away

Unless you're unhappy but that shouldn't be the case cause you said
Said he was the one baby yes you said said you were in love (love)
When you left me u said that you wouldn't be comin' back
Remember that but I never agreed

I hate to say it but I told you so
Told you if you left that you were goin' be miserable
Guess he don't do it like me
Or else you wouldn't be

I hate to say it but you know I'm right
Every time you're up you're callin' for me late at night
But now that you ain't got me tell me where you goin' be
Cause I can't take you back no my heart wont let me

Girl you know he can't touch like I do
I don't see you trippin' or flippin' over his moves
Don't take a genius to see he ain't that dude
But you let him back you don't know what you was on
When you said said he was the one
Baby yes you said said you were in love
When you left me you said that you wouldn't be
Comin' back remember that but I never agreed

I hate to say it but I told you so

You fell on hard times it seems but you ain't getting no sympathy
No baby not from me cause I told you you should never leave
See you chose this road so you gotta go it alone
Remember I told you so

Told you if you left that you were goin' be miserable

I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough
And it was all in vain

Before you know
It you're frozen

For the very first time
With you
My heart melts
Into the ground
Found something true
And everyone's
Looking round
Thinking I'm going crazy

But I don't care
What they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know
The truth
My heart's crippled
By the vein
That I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

Trying hard not to hear
But they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds
Fill my ears
Try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that the goal
Is to keep me from falling

But nothings greater
Than the rush that comes
With your embrace
And in this
World of loneliness
I see your face
Yet everyone around me
Thinks
That I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe

But I don't care
What they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know
The truth
My heart's crippled
By the vein
That I keep on closing

And it's draining all of me
Oh, they find it
Hard to believe
I'll be wearing these scars
For everyone to see

But I don't care

It still smells just like you
Damn those sweet memories
How do you how do you sleep?
How do you sleep?

Tried my best at movin' on
Have yet to find a girl like you
See things now I didn't before
Now wishin' I had more time with you

How do you stay awake
Knowin' all I do is think of you
All the things we thought about
Then, never will happen again
If I could just see you

If I had my way I'd come and get you girl
In your favorite car with the missing top
Around my way where we used to park
And did all those things to steal your heart

It still smells just like you
Damn those sweet memories
How do you how do you sleep?
How do you sleep?

Baby all that I hear from my friends
Again again and again come and ask 'bout you
They say, ""We saw your girl at the game
And damn we gotta say a big mistake by you""

Not only does your body bang
But I miss the conversation too
Tell me that you're gettin' more sleep
Can't think can't eat till I come see you

If I had my way I'd come and get you girl
In your favorite car with the missing top
Around my way where we used to park
And did all those things to steal your heart

It's been about a year now
Ain't seen or heard from you
I've been missing you crazy
How do you how do you sleep
I found the letter you wrote me
It still smells just like you
Damn those sweet memories
How do you how do you sleep?
How do you sleep?

Look, now it's been about a year and I'm tryin to figure out, how could ya?
Forget about who loves you the most, why would ya?
Heal my heart (heart), heal my brain (brain)
Oh how I wish you could feel my pain
'Cause I couldn't get you off my mind if I tried (hey)
Twenty-four seven, (three six five)
And my nights so cold (cold), days so long (long)
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
Well it's gone and I'm trippin how much I miss it
And you steady walkin 'round like I never existed
And it's hard to understand (hey), you got another plan (hey)
Tryin to play harder, you got another man
But you'll never find another like moi (moi)
That have you ridin' round in a drop top car (car)
Baby you a star and it's time that you know it
So much love and it's time that we show it (LUDA!)

It's been about a year now
Ain't seen or heard from you
I've been missing you crazy
How do you how do you sleep

It still smells just like you

How do you how do you sleep?

Jesse McCartney,"Used to be the richest
But I didn't pay attention
Messed around and maxed out of love
So now my hearts empty

I used to wake up daily
In the arms of a blessing
Couldn't see what was right in front of me
It taught me a lesson

Went around here hittin' these clubs
Throwing up money
Picking up girls
Bring 'em back to the house on the hill
Two at a time
Pop 'em like pills
When my prize was sittin' at home
Waiting for me all along
Never thought that one day I'd come home
And she'd be gone

She was the one that got away
The one I regret
My biggest mistake
She was my Mrs. Wife
Miss I can spend my life
It's too late, now she's miss mistake
She should've been my Mrs.
Don't wanna move on but I know that she has
Now every other I compare to her
She was my Mrs. Wife
Miss I can spend my life
It's too late, now she's Ms. mistake
She should've been my Mrs.

I'm not asking for.. what we had before
Took my loss like a man its over now I understand

Oh, I messed up what we had
Oh, could've been the mother of my kids

Oh, I knew just what I did
Now I gotta live with it

You really didn't take that long
The lies got old, the bed got cold
Shut her heart up, closed the door
Told me no, not no more

So I gotta respect her wishes
She deserves more than I've given
And I'll probably be okay if I can get her out of my brain

She was the one that got away
The one I regret
My biggest mistake
She was my Mrs. Wife
Miss I can spend my life
It's too late, now she's miss mistake
She should've been my Mrs.
Don't wanna move on but I know that she has
Now every other I compare to her

Miss I can spend my life
It's too late, now she's Ms. mistake
She should've been my Mrs.

Mrs. Settle down
No more sleepin' around
Mrs. Picket Fence
Mrs. Brand New House

But I screwed it up
I misstepped out of luck
Had a good one
Now she's got a new mister

If there's a brother out there
That understands then help me say yeah, yeah whoa oh oh

Anybody that knows you better go and help say whoa oh oh

She was the one

Oh, oh,oh,oh

She was the one that got away
The one I regret

When you found out and see that this is something that couldn't work out
You thought that you'd be ready

I just wanted to be the one to save you, the one that knew how
But this all would have an ending, it was so clear to see

I know what it's like from the other side
So baby who am I to be that other guy?

This could be our home girl, a special place
Something much more than your great escape
Girl I would give anything now if you didn't had everything now

You tell me that your love for me would never change

Jesse Powell,"Don't try to tell me you don't know what I feel
When all I do is try to please you
Do what I can to show my love is for real,
Still you just push me away
Come on girl give me wutcha know I deserve
I only want what is right
Don't leave me hanging with my heart on the verge,
Of breaking down every night

[Chorus]
Cause you should know by now, without any question
I live and die for the love of you
When the sun don't shine
I'll still be by your side
So baby you should know, that I love you

And everything you do in my mind
But now I need it for real, from you baby
I know inside ya that there's someone that's kind,
But I dunno how long I can deal with it.
Oh, 
Come on and give me what you know I deserve,
I only want what is right
Don't leave me hanging with my heart on the verge,
Of breaking down every night

Cause no other man will know you like I do,
And no other man will treat you like I do,
Only a man who really loves you, 
Would stand the test, that you've put me through
For your heart

Two years have passed
I took you for granted
It ended too fast, 'cause I
I wasn't payin' much attention to your needs girl
You tried and tried a million times
You cried to me girl

But I couldn't see
The pain you went through
I was killin' you softly
But I never knew, 'til I found
I found it in that lonely place
You left for me girl
And now it's killin' me
That's how it's got to be girl

Girl, you build my heart to break it down
Here I'm cryin' out but no one's around
What does it matter now?
What does it matter now?

'Till the day that you stopped lovin' me
I didn't realize that I cared for you
'Till I heard the news
That you're leaving me

Now I realize that I love you
And I'm hopin' that it's not too late
Please pack your bags
And come on back
'Cause now I realize that I'm in love with you

Two weeks have gone
My life is a mess
The closets are empty
Not even a dress girl remains
I sit and wonder what I could've done to please you
Is this the penalty for times I would mistreat you?

Now there are no lips to kiss
And no hand to hold
There's no one to hear me
When I bare my soul, and to see
To see you with somebody else would drive me crazy
Knowing you wanna fall in love and have a baby

I'm standing here, broken down
Cryin' out, but girl, you're not around
What does it matter now?
What does it matter now?

I apologize
For all the wrong things that I done
I'm sorry babe
For all the right things that I didn't do
One thing that can change a man
Is living alone

Since we said goodbye
I've been missing her so much

Imaging been in love

1- Did you love me
In a special way I
Cannot explain
I gotta find my way back to her
Gently, she always kissed me
I miss her touch so much

2- I really need her
I'd rather be by myself
That without her
I'd rather be all alone
I really need her
I'd rather be by myself
That without her

To shine upon me oh no

Why, you favor a girl that I knew
An' I imagine that she's still in Tennessee, boy
And by God, I should be there too
'Cause I've a sadness that's too sad to be true

But I left Tennessee, in a hurry, dear, now
In the same way that I'm leaving you
Because love is mainly just memories, you see
And everyone has got him a few
So when I'm gone, I'll be glad to love you

You were literally waltzing on air
At the brand new, oh, Tennessee Waltz

When I leave it'll be like I found you, love

And I'm feeling like one of your photographs, girl
Oh, ah, I'm trapped while I was putting on air
So I get even by sayin', ""Well, who cares?""

You listen when your stomach speaks

And all on account of that wine that I bought today
I`m smiling so sweet

Some fools will try to tell you it`s a sin to feel this way

It feels so funny having all of this money
I think I feel like dancing the night away

To help me to spend my dough

With the guitar turned up loud
And the fancy footwork
And the (drunk) down, drugged up crowd

Field runs a little shady creek, and there you'll
Find the cool green leaves of mint.

The heavy sweetness like to make me sick.

Jesse Winchester,"I'll never forget that dreadful day
When I decided to run away
Little Sister was playin
With a kitten on the floor
Mama was rockin out on the front porch
And Daddy had gone to the grocery store
And Brother had left the day before

Packed my clothes when no one was lookin
Went out the back door and into the bushes
And down the holler and over the creek
Then up the hill and across the field
I jumped the fence and I thumbed a ride
Much too young to realize
That I'd regret all it by and by

And I wish I had the love that was offered to me
When I was just too young and blind to see
There was a whole lot of love in that old house
But I had to leave to find it out
And it seems like it was only yesterday

If I'da known then what I know now
I'da stayed right on my daddy's old farm
Just a young upstart
I thought I was smart
Tried to be a man when I was only a child
But many a time it comes to my mind
To pack my clothes and leave this town
And jump that fence and cross that field
And down the hill and over the creek
An up the holler and through them bushes
And in the back door when no one is lookin'
And accept the love that was offered to me

I got nothing and nobody
And nowhere I got to be
And I'm going owing no one
And with no one owing me
I can pack up in a minute
And be ready, set to go
O and if you're going to love me
Then there's something you should know 

I'm a real free wheeler
And I can't slow down
I'm a rolling easy
I'm a spinning round 

When I leave you may be crying
I guess I'll be crying, too
But to have my precious freedom
There's not much that I won't do
I will ride rough-shod over lovers
Taking trust, returning pain
Not just one time
Not just two times
I mean time and time again 

Gee, my pockets mighty quiet
They don't jingle like they should
O well you may not believe me
But that emptiness feels good
I am the lily in the valley
Never toil and never spin
I can live on rain and sunshine
With my only friend the wind

No way to be an elevator operator
No way a salesman, no way a waiter
Cause I'm a gentleman, gentleman of leisure

I don't know, but I just got the feeling
I might take a while to find a position
With a pretty secretary, time to do some fishing

All the ships asleep
Maybe one cold watchman
Walks a lonely beat
Way out on the water
A ship is under sail
Leaving wavy starlight
And a dreamer in her trail 

I wave bye bye
I pray God speed
I wish lovely weather
More luck than you need
You'll only sail in circles
So there's no need to cry
No, I'll see you again one day
And then I waved bye bye 

The sailing ship reminds me
Of a certain girl
Who left a certain dreamer
To sail into the world
I've very friendly post-cards
From very far away

Of a certain day

But every time you hurt me I grow a little stronger
I'll soon be strong enough to say goodbye 

And it will be so good to smile
Gee, it's been a long, long while
After all that I've been through
Just cause I'm in love with you
But there will come a day, you'll see
You won't have control of me
You can't hurt me like you do
Just cause I'm in love with you 

I'll ask whatever saint looks after lovers
I'll ask her, would you please look after me
And would you kindly hear my prayer, and have a little mercy
Please if she doesn't love me, set me free

It was my idea we go steady
All that you would say was “Well, we'll see”
Who dreamed you'd be taking a downtown man
For a sweet loving daddy like me? 

So I moved to Milan and got married
And I became the happy family man
Until I got this feeling you were restless
But resting wasn't really in your plan
No, breaking peoples' hearts, you must be moving

And here you were taking a downtown man
For a sweet loving daddy like me 

It got so that I moved back to Brownsville
O what else was I supposed to do?
When all our friends in Milan were all your friends

Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin

And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Your hands on me have lightened every darkened place

Just settlin' down
I was lookin' for the right one baby
?N that's what I've found

I didn't go to Memphis to see the king
Or ride the Mississippi down to New Orleans
I could have found someone to give my love to
But I've been waiting for you

Jessica Andrews,"Joey was a fighter 
And he fought to dream 
He said some day he would have a fancy car 
And he'd leave Tennessee 

I was just a shy wallflower 
Just a wide-eyed teenage girl 
But maybe intrigue or just insanity 
Made me want to enter Joey's world 

His touch made me feel beautiful 
So much passion I lost my head 

[Chorus] 
He was just like James Dean in Tennessee 
He was a movie star 
A young girl's dream 
From what I hear he could never leave 
But to me he'll always be 
James Dean in Tennessee 

He tried to smoke them cigarettes 
And always made me laugh 
He said I'd be his pick-up truck queen 
And someday I'd be his better half 

I left there a year ago 
And I heard the rebel went bad 
That he had just served time for a minor crime 
And he was livin' with his old man 

[Chorus] 

I wonder what ol' Joey thinks 
When he hears me singing on the radio 
Will he ever know that I loved him so 
Sometimes we're meant to stay 
Sometimes we're meant to go 

[Chorus]",James Dean in Tennessee
Jessica Andrews,"We spent all night down by the riverside 
Laughin' at nothin' and talkin' too much 
And the moonlight was so bright in your eyes 
Before I knew it, I was fallin' in love 

It was too cold to swim so we just laid there 
On the bank 'til the break of day 
Though we never went in the water 
We were swept away 
And the river rolled 
And the night got cold 
But you held me close 
And you warmed my soul 
We spent all night down by the riverside 

Wonderin' how it happened so fast 
And it sure did take us by surprise 
When that mornin' sun came up at last 

It was too cold to swim so we just laid there 
On the bank 'til the break of day 
Though we never went in the water 
We were swept away",The Riverside
Jessica Andrews,"The moon cast a shadow 
On my bedroom wall 
One silhouette not two 
Nothing about this 
Is familiar at all 
Guess it's all what you're used to 
I never pictured myself in this frame of mind 
Maybe things will be different 
When I open my eyes 

[Chorus]
But my name ain't Dorothy 
These ain't ruby shoes 
I can't click my heel anytime I choose 
And fly away 
That ain't a tornado 
Blowing out that door 
That's the sound of him leaving 
Cause he don't love me anymore 
I'll just walk the floor 
Oh, but I sure could use 
Some of those ruby shoes 

Wish I could wave a wand 
Like he waved goodbye 
And change the lock on my heart 
This is gonna drown me 
One tear at a time 
If I don't stop it before it starts 
Just sitting here wishing 
Won't get it done 
I know there's a road outta here 
But I don't know which one

Sure could use

Some of those ruby shoes",Ruby Shoes

Jessica Andrews,"You're kicking tires, I'm sitting on the fence 
Love's falling all around us and it don't make sense 
How long can the two of us beat around the bush 
We're right out on the edge but we need a little push 

Dancing on the tightrope, wearing it thin 
Instead of closing our eyes and jumping in

Do you want to kiss 
Do you want to kiss 
Do you want to kiss 
You go first 

You're dodging the moon and I'm playing it safe 
Look what we're not doing, oh boy, what a waste 
And what could be worse than never saying it at all 
Is never knowing the feeling, never feeling the fall 

What's it gonna take to get us both there 
Can't you see what I'm suggesting, it's a double dare

You start if you have the nerve 
I'll trust my heart, but you go first

And saw the water shine with the moon
What kind of fool would fail to notice
The best thing shining was you

Oh, I laughed kinda nervous
I felt you move closer
And felt the world unwind
Once was a stranger, not quite a lover
But steadily crossing the line

Carry me far away
Don't hold back; I won't break
Leave the ghosts behind
All I know, wrong or right
Just the thought of this night
Will get me every time
Every time

Well, the voice in my head said
""What are you doing?""
I thought not listening to you
You see I'm taking a chance
I'm thinking about flying over the blue

And it's crazy to be this out of practice
And have it all come so naturally
Don't you love knocking logic right off its axis
And watch it float far out to sea

Carry me far away
Don't hold back; I won't break
Leave the ghosts behind
All I know, wrong or right
Just the thought of this night
Will get me every time

In the winding lines of your hand

Head right for the promised land

And someone opens up their world and lets

For your whole life is standing right there

That the Lord is King and He reigns over every test
I won't give up 'cause He holds me in His arms

With every attack he tried to take my mind

All those things that I have learned, have learned
Storms in my head, they are brewing today
Too much resistance will soon break the gauge

Sucked into space, notice the lack of O2
Something's not right here
Your gravity's defeating me, sadness and beauty are one in the same
Now I'm chasing salvation again over and over
Don't you feel the same way
I need to reciprocate
All those things that I have learned, have learned
Don't you feel the same way
I need to regurgitate
All these things that I have learned, have learned",Gravity
Jessica Jarrell,"It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all

Jessica Johnson,"Now you say you're lonely
You cried the whole night through
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Go on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river............over you

It must have fallen out of a hole
In your old brown overcoat
They never said your name

I was so surprised and shocked
And I wondered, too
If by chance you heard it for yourself
I never told a soul
Just how I've been feeling about you

When you hear our song
Things are not the same
Since we broke up last June
The only thing that I wanna hear
Is that you love me still
And that you think
You'll be comin' home real soon
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, you kinda made me feel proud
When I heard him say
You couldn't find the words to say it yourself
And now in my heart I know
I can say what I really feel

Jessica Mauboy,"Kids out driving Saturday afternoon pass me by
I'm just savouring familiar sights
We share some history, this town and I
And I can't stop that long forgotten feeling of him
Time to book a room to stay tonight

Number one is to find some friends to say, you're doing well
After all this time, you boys look just the same
Number two is the happy hour at one of two hotels
Settle in to play ""Do you remember so and so?""
Number three is never say his name

And, oh, the flame trees will blind the weary driver
And there's nothing else could set fire to this town
There's no change, there's no pace
Everything within its place
Just makes it harder to believe that he won't be around

Oh, who needs that sentimental bullshit, anyway
You know it takes more than just a memory to make me cry
And I'm happy just to sit here, round a table with old friends
See which one of us can tell the biggest lies

And there's a girl, she's falling in love near where the pianola stands
With a young local factory out-of-worker, just holding hands
And I'm wondering if he'll go or if he'll stay

Do you remember, nothing stopped us on the field
In our day

Oh, the flame trees will blind the weary driver
And there's nothing else could set fire to this town
There's no change, there's no pace
Everything within its place
Just makes it harder to believe that he won't be around",Flame Trees

Well, that's ok, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me

With his influential friends

He's got very big connections
And I follow his directions
Bernie knows his way around
And so I always do what Bernie recommends

I am blessed
With my attorney Bernie
I'm impressed
With the way he runs the store

He's got Dodger season boxes
And an office full of foxes
It's amazing all the different things
Your average guy might need a lawyer for

Bernie tells me what to do
Bernie lays it on the line
Bernie says, we sue, we sue
Bernie says, we sign, we sign

I'm in touch
With my attorney Bernie
In a clutch
He can speed right to the scene

And if I'm locked up in the jail
With just one phone call for my bail
He said to call his club collect
Or deal directly with his answering machine

And when I dine
With my attorney Bernie
He buys wine
From the rare imported rack

That's 'cause Bernie is a purist
And not your polyester tourist
Bernie waves the glass around awhile
Then takes a sip and always sends it back

Bernie tells me what to do
Bernie lays it on the line
Bernie says, we sue, we sue
Bernie says, we sign, we sign

I admire
My attorney Bernie
I admire
Any guy who knows his stuff

Sure we blew a couple ventures
With a counterfeit debentures
But you win a few, you lose a few
Like Bernie says, ""You keep on hanging tough""

Thanks to you
My attorney Bernie
Thanks to you
I'm considered well to do

Sure I made out like a bandit
Just exactly like you planned it
But like Murray, my accountant
Told me yesterday, I owe it all to you.

Bernie tells me what to do
Bernie lays it on the line
Bernie says, we sue, we sue
Bernie says, we sign, we sign

On the dotted line

Could there be something just ain't right
Maybe you need me by your side
When will you see

I keep calling out what about me what about me
Your looking everywhere but to the one who truly cares
I keep calling out what about me what about me
What about me

Well didn't I bring you out the dark before
Didn't I show you how you could soar
Why cant you see that I'm the only one you need
I keep calling out what about me what about me
Your looking everywhere but to the one who truly cares
I keep calling out what about me what about me

To the very last time you waved and honked your horn.
I had no chance at all, to watch you grow,
Up so sadly, beautiful.
Up so sadly, beautiful.

Baby needs a brand new pair of eyes.
Cause the ones you got now, see only good-byes.
I had no chance at all, to let you know,
Oh so sadly, beautiful.

Well, you've got your father's hair,
And you've got your father's nose,
But you got my soul.

Jessica Riddle,"I have a foot to wrestle
Under the table
And he will keep my toes 
Warm late at night
And I have a leg to pretzel 
While we're watching cable.
And he will wrap around me tight

I have a sexy stomach 
To run my fingers along
And he'll take off his shirt 
And drive me wild
And I have an arm to hold me
And he's so strong
And he will flex it with a smile

You make me happy
When I feel too much.
And when my hand are cold
You warm them up
And I'm not worried
When you're not around
And I hear symphonies
Without a sound

I have two lips to tell me 
That I am loved
And he will kiss me 'til I
Can't move at all
And I have two eyes to melt me

And he makes me want to fall

Jessica Robinson,"An only child alone and wild, a cabinet maker's son
His hands were meant for different work
And his heart was known to none
He left his home and went his lone and solitary way
And he gave to me a gift I know I never can repay

A quiet man of music denied a simpler fate
He tried to be a soldier once, but his music wouldn't wait
He earned his love through discipline, a thundering velvet hand
His gentle means of sculpting souls took me years to understand

The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band

My brother's lives were different for they heard another call
One went to Chicago and the other to St Paul
And I'm in Colorado when I'm not in some hotel
Living out this life I've chose and come to know so well

I thank you for the music and your stories of the road
I thank you for the freedom when it came my time to go
I thank you for the kindness and the times when you got tough
And papa, I don't think I said I love you near enough

The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band
I am a living legacy to the leader of the band",The Leader of the Band

Waitin' for that day.
Then you reached through the hurricane,
When you baby you called my name.

You broke through the storm,
And you turned back the night.
Baby you are the fire,
Burnin' the midnight sky,
And your love,
Keeps taking me higher.
Just when all hope was gone,
Where the hero belongs
There you were.

Must have broken into heaven,
Just to roll back the clouds.
Were you on a mission.
Were you seekin' me out.
Was I that one in a million.
Was I that one sacred kiss,
That you couldn't chance,
You just couldn't miss.
Then you whispers through the silent tears,
When you swept away all my fears.

You broke through the storm,
And you turned back the night.

Tellin' me not to cry anymore.
Where I watched my whole world fall apart,
Shinin' through like an angel from afar

How will I wipe the tears from your eyes?

Of what the day will bring

[Chorus]
In the fallen snow under the mistletoe
I need you here with me when I hold you close
Baby, take my hand in wonderland
Cause its Merry Christmas time again

Its Christmas time again

A wreath on every front door
Lights hung for all to see
Warm cider by the fire
Stockings for you and me
Kids plant a gift for Santa
Milk and cookies by the tree
I'm wondering what will he bring
This year on Christmas eve

[Chorus]

Well there's nothing like being home for Christmas
Its a wonderful time of year
And there's just one thing that's noticed missing
Baby I'd feel that somethings missing
If you're not here

I see your eyes are shining
Just like the morning sky
One thing there's no denying
Loves gift of you and I
It's Christmas time again (Merry Christmas)
It's Christmas time again (Merry Christmas
It's Christmas time again (Merry Christmas)
Its Christmas (Its Christmas time again)
Merry Christmas (It's Christmas time again)
Oh yeah (Its Christmas time again)",It's Christmas Time Again

How I hate going out in the snow!

All the way home I'll be warm

Jessica Simpson,"When the weather is cold
When money is low
It's better with someone to hold
And when the road up ahead
Is so unclear 
I'd rather be together not hear
When the circle life throws you a curve
There's someone of better or worse
And when you pick up the pace
But loosing the race
A friendly and familiar face

Everyone wants to be kissing on new years eve
Underneath the mistletoe 
While it's snowing outside
Making fireworks like it's the forth of July

Sometimes it's gotta be a no show
Probably end your heart though
Better to learn crashing by
Then never to fly at all
The chances are it falls apart
Sometimes it's over before it starts
Better to know crashing but 
Then never to fly at all

The ship doesn't sail
You try but you fail
Your lover keeps checking the mail
And whenever your down
From crying out loud
You'd rather see his face in the crowd
If you see the top 
You know it's making it there
Or if you didn't bring somebody who cares
Your a day to late or a minute to soon
Your stealing the stars

Jessica Simpson,"Life is a curve ball 
Thrown with the wild arm 
And if I'm going to swing in, I must get motivated 
Instead of lying in my bed
I'm like a train wreck, trucking down a fast hill 
Heartbreak is overrated 
If I dry the tears now
I can get a head start out the door 

I never loved the sun until the rain
I'll never get anywhere if I stay on a same place
Always afraid I'm (afraid I'm, afraid I'm...)

Gonna just get stuck in a dream
Where the answer's clear but no one knows it
It's like a toss up, I gotta get off here
'Cause I'm tired of emotions

I'm blue no more
Walkin' round in a circle
Deja vu no more
Walkin' round in a circle

Being redundant is never the one trick I ever want to master 
One quirk can get me focused 
'Cause the start of a circle is also the ending 
One door has to close before the next can open
Gotta give my own life
My whole life is a given one sweet goal

I never loved the sun until the rain
I'll never get anywhere if I stay on a same place
Always afraid I'm (afraid I'm, afraid I'm...)

And I just get stuck in a dream
Where the answer's clear but no one knows it
It's like a toss up, I gotta get off here
'Cause I'm tired of emotions

I'm blue no more
Walkin' round in a circle
Deja vu no more
Walkin' round in a circle

How can I be my best, there's never fail
How can I ever find peace if I never yell 
I gotta be stronger
I can't let cold wind blow me on a cold night
I follow the skyline and I am no longer

Stuck in a dream
Where the answer's clear but no one knows it
It's like a toss up, I gotta get off here

I ain't into games, I don't want to waste
Any time and all the energy we could spend
Being together boy forever you're my best friend
Got a little problem that I can't mend
You been taking me for granted you
I don't want to walk away from what we have, and you know it
I'm not telling you all of this to make you mad
It's not about who's right or wrong
It's not about who's weak or strong
It's about what I need to make this last

A little more time, a little less wait
A little more heart, a little less break
Simple and true, what they say
A little bit goes a long way
A little less talk, a little more do
A little more me, a little less you
Baby at the end of the day
A little bit goes a long way

I need your heart
I need your love

Don't want to end up in a tricky situation
So I'm giving you my every indication
We can work it out together stop the tension
Try to understand, baby where I stand
I love you and I'm trying to be gentle
So let me break it down for you and make it simple
I gave my heart and soul to you now it's essential
That you show a little love for me

I don't want to walk away or let you go, and you know it
I'm not telling you all of this to make you sad
It's not about the tears we cry
It's about how hard we try
To give a little more and see the other side

A little more heart, a little less break

A little less talk, a little more do
A little more me, a little less you
Baby at the end of the day

And it hurts me, 'cause I care and I'm telling you why
I'm unhappy so if you love me
A little bit is not that much to ask to make things right
Oh yeah, oh yeah, a little bit goes a long, long way

Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.

Are drifting through my opened mind

Dance before me like a million eyes,

Thoughts meander like a
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Shines around me like a million suns,

Jessica Williams,"Ask me how do I feel,
Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is

Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is

Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

I'd surely be Spring,

If I were a bell

[Chorus]
I can't go on like this
Not a day more,
Pouring all I have come to know
Into open hands that are still somehow closed,
I can't go on like this
Not a day more

This is a shape of love
Jagged in a way its love,
The one that cuts, you're leaving room
For me to still go out and find some
Take control and leave behind a part of me that's still attached to you

[Chorus]

I know,
You are not enough
I know
You are not enough
You put me in the state of mind of someone else
Who I've looked at through their broken eyes,
Begging
Does everybody know?
Does everybody know
This face?

This afternoon has grown as cold as the hand I've been given
No warmth and never good light, instead,
The dreary hour's always upon me
Freezing up my home
Towering above me like a god-less sky

[Chorus]",Not a Day More
Jessie Baylin,"I'm not stopping, waiting on nothing
Moving quickly trying to catch whats mine, 
Whats destined, come inside the dreamer
I'll be rushing, making a lot of noise.

Take my jacket, all my belongings
I don't need them they do me no good
They weigh me down
This living is so heavy
And I need space to get on a higher plane

See how I run, you see how I'm running now

Don't start thinking that's how you'll lose it
You step left, right you can't get confused
I'll take my chances under the pressure
A risk ain't nothing, there's nothing I can lose

I'm not standing still on this mountain
I'm chasing down whats been haunting me
I'm staring up and into the great heights
I won't look down
Its not where I want to be

See how I run, you see how I'm running now
See how I run, you see how I'm running, see how I'm running now

Shake me down I got nothing on me
I won't look back there's nothing to see
I'm moving quickly, I'm GOOD and I'm ready
And I won't turn around,
Its not where I'm meant to be.

Jessie Baylin,"What a fine southern man
Down in Tennessee 
A good old boy
Eyes in which I dream
And he's awkward as a teen
Beautiful, drawer that I can hang on to

[Chorus]
I find a comfort in his sound
He wouldn't preach 
Unless he found something he believed would last 
That he believed could the hands of time
I'm trying to find a way to make him mine

What a gem, a treasure chest
Out diggin' deep
A gentleman, He'd bring me peace
And I'm floating in his sea
So beautiful, I could just sail away

Jessie Baylin,"I know nothing of that clock, tick tock sounds game
I was alone by the beach and stuck in it's trance, passing me by,
Passing everything I could have done, could have held in and embraced, 
I am open these days

[Chorus]
And who but the sun knows if I'll rise,
It's taking me a long time to make this compromise,
You know what I wanted and I'm wanting it still
Tick-tocking of a clock got a long way to heal

So shoot me in the back now and see if I run,
Let them watch while I cry and remember where I came from,
It's like kissing in the dark,
Looking for the lips that can make a kind mark

[Chorus]

I can't do it no more
And I wouldn't want to anymore
Can't do it, no

Passing everything I could have done,
Could have held in and embraced, I am open these days

It's You and things that used to matter
Suddenly just scatter when You break through

I don't know why, I don't know how
It's so easy to forget and fall back in
So I start listening to something that was said
In a world that's deafening above everything

Through the noise everything disappears

Jessie J,"We may not have all the answers
Oh I know that we can change some of the things that are beyond our control
And the vision of us may be blurry
But use your heart to see
Just follow the beat, the rhythm will lead you right back to me

Sometimes it's a game of give and take
It's easy to break
But hold on and wait
Have a little faith

I will go down to the last round
I'll be your strength to find you when you get lost in the crowd
So I'll stand up tall, if by chance I fall
Then I'll go down as a casualty of love

The battle of us could be simple
Escape without being hurt
'Cause love is our shield, keeps us concealed
From what could get even worse

So baby let me be the soldier
Don't be overtaken by pride
Just close your eyes, take my hand
I promise to keep us alive

Sometimes it's a game of give and take
It's easy to break
But hold on and wait
Have a little faith

I will go down to the last round
I'll be your strength to find you when you get lost in the crowd
So I'll stand up tall, if by chance I fall
Then I'll go down as a casualty of love

All is fair
In love and war
Knock me down
And I'll get back up wanting more
Through the fire and rain
It makes me numb from the pain
That's the price, that's the price, I'll pay

And I will go down to the last round
I'll be your strength to find you when you get lost in the crowd
So I'll stand up tall, and baby if I fall
Then I'll go down as a casualty of love",Casualty of Love

I wish I could have another minute, to finish this fairytale.
Hear your voice and get lost in it, cause all I got is broken details.
You were my world and everything in it, so how did you disappear.
I won't say it is over, cause you're still here.

I won't forget I will sit and reminisce, tell each other all our secrets.
To have you back would be my only wish (cause nobody knew me like you did).
The things you knew were all written in my diary, hide and seek open up and come and spy me.
Count to ten and I don't know what to feel
I can't feel, don't feel I can't feel.

My shadow, my shadow, I know you're close
My shadow, my shadow, you're everywhere I go
So I don't see the need to cry cause, you'll never leave my life.

You ready?

Seems like everybody's got a price
I wonder how they sleep at night
When the sale comes first
And the truth comes second
Just stop for a minute and smile
Why is everybody so serious
Acting so damn mysterious
Got shades on your eyes
And your heels so high that you can't even have a good time

Everybody look to their left
Everybody look to their right
Can you feel that, yeah
We're paying with love tonight
It's not about the money money money
We don't need your money money money
We just wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
Ain't about the uh cha-ching cha-ching
Ain't about the yeah b-bling b-bling
Wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag

We need to take it back in time
When music made us all unite
And it wasn't low blows and video hoes
Am I the only the one getting tired
Why is everybody so obsessed
Money can't buy us happiness
Can we all slow down and enjoy right now
Guarantee we'll be feeling alright

Everybody look to their left
Everybody look to their right
Can you feel, yeah

And take the cash back
Just give me six strings
And a half stack
And you can, can keep the cars
Leave me the garage
And all I, yes all I need are keys and guitars
And guess what, in thirty seconds I'm leaving to Mars
Yeah we leaping across these undefeatable odds
It's like this man, you can't put a price on the life
We do this for the love so we fight and sacrifice every night
So we ain't gonna stumble and fall never
Waiting to see us in a sign of defeat uh uh
So we gonna keep everyone moving they feet
So bring back the beat and then everyone sing

Jessie J,"The girl who always says yes
Wants to scream no
Takes over everyone's stress, uh
And ignores her own
The life and soul of the party
But loves to stay home
She say's she's not broken-hearted
But cries on her own

Playing pretend
I shouldn't hide it
It isn't right
Being a liar
I'm crossing the line
Dancing with fire,
When I'm not fine
Should I deny it?

'Cause I'm going crazy when I'm not okay,
I keep praying that the cracks don't show my pain, uh
'Cause even when I'm falling, I say my life is like a dream, uh
But I'm fighting through a nightmare,

So you don't really know me (oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)

The girl who starts all the jokes
Just make her laugh,
Preaches the do's and the don'ts
But loves to be bad,
Smiles when they guess who she's loving
What they say makes her mad

But she hopes for your hand

I slip back into my jeans

Hear the radio playin' my song
I still get butterflies
Still get nervous inside

We waste the night away
Spend Saturday sleepin' in late

Hey boy I would have thought that when you left me
I'd be broken with my confidence gone, so gone

Hey boy I would have thought that when you said
That you don't want me
I'd feel ugly and sense something was wrong
Standin' front of the mirror, my skins never been clearer
My smile has never been wider.

I look so good without you,
Got me a new hairdo
Looking fresh and brand new
Since you said ""that were through""
Done, with your lies,
Baby now my tears dried
You can see my brown eyes
Ever since you said goodbye
I look so good, I look so good without you

I'd feel sexy and so good in my skin again
And I never would have known that I'd be dreamin' so much better without you in my head

Ain't bitin' my nails since you walked out of the door.

is so heavenly, too good to be real.

Tell me where to follow.

You gave me them both and more yet,
A reason to fall, and a reason to hide
Suddenly all I'm left with

I was so sure this was real, but
Now I'm sure of nothing at all

I had to shatter to pieces
You made me reveal myself, reveal myself
So if you no longer need them
Then give them to someone else, to someone else

Take what you gave
And throw it away
Now everything's changed, it's misplaced
Nothing to say, 'cause I'm not the same.
It's almost as if we just met.

I was so sure this was real but
Now I'm sure of nothing at all

I had to shatter to pieces
You made me reveal myself, reveal myself
Now that you no longer need them
I'll give them to someone else, to someone else

It's illogical, I was nothing without you
But you ought to know
I was lost when I had found you

I had to shatter to pieces
Made me reveal myself, reveal myself
Now that you no longer them, I'll give them someone else.

You find da world
Guess it's over
You'll find da space
Then you'll find stars
You look at the sun
And you see a light
You look into my eyes
Then you'll find me mind!

Yeaaaaaaaaaaah hey!
You make me crazy!!

Oh it's so cold
When rain falls
Got stupid brain
When I'm on da train
I was stupid child
And I'm still stupid now
My head hit da ball
And da ball hit da ground

Yeaaaaaaaaaaah hey!
You make me crazy!!

Get up I'm ready !
Get up there!
Cum on alone!
Get up won't you get up and down?
Stop!
Stars....!
The space...!

You make me crazy!",Think About the Way
Jessy Dixon,"I am redeemed, bought with a price, 
Jesus has changed my whole life. 
If anybody asks you, just who I am, 
tell them I am redeemed. 

Verse 1 
Where there is hat, love now abides, 
where there was confusion, peace now reigns. 
I'm a child, child of the King, 
it's all because I am redeemed. 

I am redeemed, bought with a price, 
Jesus has changed my whole life. 
If anybody asks you, just who I am, 
tell them I am redeemed. 

I'll tell of His favor, I'll tell of His love, 
I'll tell of His goodness to me. 
He purchased my redemption with His own precious blood, 
and from sin I've been set free. 

I am redeemed, bought with a price, 
Jesus has changed my whole life. 
If anybody asks you, just who I am, 
tell them I am redeemed. 

There's no shackles on me, I'm as free as I can be; 
because Jesus changed my life. 
He died up on the cross, 
that's why I can tell the world that I am redeemed. 

I am redeemed, bought with a price, 
Jesus has changed my whole life. 
If anybody asks you, just who I am, 
tell them I am redeemed. 

If you run across anybody that used to know me, 
tell them I'm doing fine. 
The last time that you saw me, 
I was lifting up holy hands, 
I'll tell them I've been redeemed. 

I am redeemed, bought with a price, 
Jesus has changed my whole life. 
If anybody asks you, just who I am, 
tell them I am redeemed.",I Am Redeemed
Jessy Greene,"Walk along the river, sweet lullaby, it just keeps on flowing,
It don't worry 'bout where it's going, no, no.
Don't fly, mister blue bird, I'm just walking down the road,
Early morning sunshine tell me all I need to know

You're my blue sky, you're my sunny day.
Lord, you know it makes me high when you turn your love my way,
Turn your love my way, yeah.

Good old Sunday morning, bells are ringing everywhere.
Goin' to Carolina, it won't be long and I'll be there

Jessy J,"I'm here just like I said
Though its breaking every rule I've ever made
My racing heart is just the same
Why make it strong to break it once again?

And I'd love to say I do
Give everythin' to you
But I can never now be true
So I say

I think I'd better leave right now
Before I fall any deeper
I think I'd better leave right now
Feeling weaker and weaker
Somebody better show me how
Before I fall any deeper
I think I'd better leave right now

I'm here so please explain
Why you're opening up a healing wound again
I'm a little more careful perhaps it shows
But if I lose the highs at least I'm spared the lows

Now I tremble in your arms
What could be the harm
To feel my spirit calm
So I say

I think I'd better leave right now
Before I fall any deeper
I think I'd better leave right now
Feeling weaker and weaker
Somebody better show me how
Before I fall any deeper
I think I'd better leave right now

I wouldn't know how to say
How good it feels seeing you today
I see you've got your smile back
Like you say your right on track

But you may never know why
Once bitten twice is shy
If I'm proud perhaps I should explain
I couldn't bear to lose you again

I think I'd better leave right now
Before I fall any deeper
I think I'd better leave right now
I'm feeling weaker and weaker
Somebody better show me how
Before I fall any deeper
I think I'd better leave right now

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You
Jessye Norman,"Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me

Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me
Spring is here I hear

Jessye Norman,"With a song in my heart, I behold your adorable face
Just a song at the start but it soon is a hymn to your grace
When the music swells, I'm touching your hand
It tells me you're standing near, and

At the sound of your voice, heaven opens its portals to me
Can I help but rejoice that a song such as ours came to be
But I always knew I would live life through
With a song in my heart for you

But I always knew I would live life through
With a song in my heart for you",With a Song in My Heart

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.","Speak Low, song for voice & piano (from ""One Touch of Venus"")"
Jessye Norman,"There's not a morning I begin
Without a thousand questions
Running through my mind
That I don't try to find the reason
And the logic in the world
That God design
The reason why, a bird was given wings
If not to fly, and praise the sky
With every song it sings
What's right or wrong
Where I belong
Within the scheme of things

And why have eyes that see
And arms that reach
Unless you're meant to know there's
Something more
If not to hunger for the meaning of it all
Then tell me what a soul is for
Why have the wings unless you're meant to fly
And tell me please why have a mind
If not to question why

And tell me where
Where is it written what it is I'm meant to be
That I can't dare to have the chance to
Pick the fruit of every tree
Or have my share of every sweet imagined possibility
Just tell me where, where is it written, tell me where

If I were only meant to tend the nest
Then why does my imagination sail
Across the mountains and the seas
Beyond the make-believe of any fairy tale
Why have the thirst if not to drink the wine
And what a waste to have a taste
Of things that can't be mine

And tell me where
Where is it written what it is I'm meant to be
That I can't dare to see the meanings
In the mornings that I see
Or have my share of every sweet imagined possibility
Just tell me where, where is it written, tell me where
Or if it's written anywhere

Jessye Norman,"If it takes forever, I will wait for you
For a thousand summers, I'll wait for you
'Til you're here beside me, 'til I'm touching you
'Til I hear you sigh I'll wait for you

Anywhere you wander, anywhere you go
Everyday just remember, how I love you so
In your heart believe what in my heart I know
That forever more I'll wait for you

The clock will tick away the hours one by one
Then the time will come when all the waiting's done
The time when you return and find me here and run
Straight to my waiting arms

The clock will tick away the hours one by one
Then the time will come when all the waiting's done
Time when you return and find me here and run
Straight to my arms

If it takes forever, I will wait for you

Jessye Norman,"In the still of the night
As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill

Jessye Norman,"My ship has sails that are made of silk
The decks are trimmed with gold
And of jam and spice there's a paradise in the hold

My ship's aglow with a million pearls
And rubies fill each bin
The sun sits high in a sapphire sky when my ship comes in

I can wait the years
Till it appears
One fine day one spring
But the pearls and such
They won't mean much if there's missing just one thing

I do not care if that day arrives
That dream need never be
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring
My own true love to me
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring my own true love to me","My Ship, song for voice & piano (from ""Lady in the Dark"") [From Lady in"

And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads

Jesus Jones,"You know that sleep is getting hard to get
'Cause you never know what you'll forget
And I've got to know of all the news
'Cause one day there'll be news for me
I never let a headline by
'Cause every one will catch my eye
And though it's tough to keep alert
You never know what could hurt me
But it gets me down
You know it gets me down
It really gets me down
Yes it gets me down
Info Freako, 
There is no end to what I want to know
There's what you feel 
And what you know
And it wasn't all that long ago
I found that Info Freako thing 
Now nothing ever gets to me
But it gets me down...
Info Freako, 
There is no end to what I want to know
But it means I'll have the edge over you
And it means I'll always have the edge over you

On the dash her son's come off worse
We've got a carload of faith here 
And we're saved from the world by some verse

Will ever move people this way

I want it, if it moves mountains
I want it, move mountains for me

Or maybe just made
You waste my time with explanations
So all the big colors fade
So you want to be happy
Don't you know happy is never enough
Looking for big answers getting nowhere
But then you're swimming in the shallow end
You take these broken bones
I'll tell you something, these things don't mend
So you want to be happy 
Don't you know happy is never enough
I'm on the wrong train I can tell

Jesus Jones,"Well I don't know about you
But there's not a lot that I want to do
I could get a job in a bank...

But I've seen the ad I want the car

If you can have it, I can have it
All that's yours can surely be mine
And it's one for the money
To keep up with the Jones'
So you can look around and see you're not alone
Money wasn't meant for the poor
And it's truer now than ever before
You either have it or you don't 
So where do you fit?
It's never never when you need it
Always always when you don't but that's life

And I don't mind all the things they say about you

I believe in the unknown
So I'm sure you won't disappoint me
These home truths fall on deaf ears
So I know you won't disappoint me
SMile, smile, smile, while the glory days are here
Where's the hurry, worry all next year
And don't mind me 'cause I'm really only looking
It may seem strange, but that's all I want to do
I believe in the unknown...

Jesus Jones,"Understand that we don't dislike you
Nothing ever goes quite as planned

So we just know you'll understand

Jesus Jones,"Never met you, but how I love you so
Never met you, and yet you take up all my time, you know
So say hello to the whole in my world
So say hello to the desperation girl
She's my, She's my, She's my desperation girl
Too much time I have spent alone
And in that time the seeds of something bad were sown
What's going on with the state of my mind
When I look in, it's always her that I find
She's my...
These are desperate signs of desperate times
And desperate times breed desperate minds",Song 13

Kick you around and say that there is
Nothing wrong with you that a good kick in the pants wouldn't cure
Haven't you heard that they're all too scared

Nothing wrong with you that a little bit of truth wouldn't cure
Shoot my mouth off
Too much to learn
Don't you know there is

But you'll never know which until you find there's
Nothing wrong with you that a quick walk down the street wouldn't cure

That the price you pay is when we say there's

And mostly that's okay

Has nothing much to say

I know you think I waste your time
But I have news for you
Here's news for you

What would you know?
But maybe I should thank you
For all your kind advice
And now I'll return the favor
Don't try to be so nice

behind to try and talk so bitter you make me feel so small
driving so fast, alive behind a dead wall

the fine line goes, contradiction is star (??)
a case of the face in the place that doesn't fit
which way to turn, why don't you just stop it

i hope my feet stay on the ground (yeow stop it now) (??)
with nothing around to hold me, to hold me, (now!) to hold me

now something just went wrong inside of my head
all the things that i've done and i've said
disappear 'cause these things don't keep
when you wake one day and find you won't go back to sleep
so don't tell me what is right and what is wrong
it's no good i've stood listening for too long
you don't understand what it means, what it's about
you can pay another day so shut up and drink up and get out

all of the things i say now (now!)
sound to me like someone wrote them for me
cheap greeting cards, hollywood films
lent to me a language no-one really uses
or do they? do they? do they?

i always leave, never stay
making promises for someday
someday hasn't yet come and you know

The louder you shout the better you're heard
The meek shall inherit the earth - that's absurd!
