Atahualpa Yupanqui,"No puede ser que me vaya del todo cuando 
Me muera
Que no quede ni la espera detrás de la voz 
Que calla

No puede ser que solo haya ciclos de sombra 
Y olvido 
En este amor desmedido que se me hiergue 
En el pecho
Si hasta en el trino deshecho se salva el duelo 
Del nido

Pongo mi infancia en canciones y siento que 
Se ilumina 
Una siesta golondrina toda duraznos pintones
Celebro las estaciones, lloro su fugacidad
Y al anegar de piedad la mortaja de su, gloria
Me crecen en la memoria remansos de eternidad

Cuando, no esté, cuando el leve sobresalto 
Que me ordena 
Se trueque en tiempo de arena conmemorado
En la nieve
Cuando en mis venas abreve la liturgia de la flor

Tal vez algún labrador cansado de madrugadas 
Sienta en sus manos aradas la mano de mi 
Rumor",La Mano de Mi Rumor
Atahualpa Yupanqui,"Yo nunca tuve tropilla
Siempre en montao en ajeno
Tuve un zaino que, de bueno
Ni pisaba la gramilla
Vivo una vida sencilla
Como es la del pobre pión
Madrugón tras madrugón

Con lluvia, escarcha o pampero
A veces, me duelen fiero
Los hígados y el riñón
Soy peón de La Estancia Vieja
Partido de Magdalena
Y aunque no valga la pena
Anoten, que no son quejas
Un portón lleno de rejas

Y allá, en el fondo, un chalé
Lo recibirá un valet
Que anda siempre disfrazao
Más no se asuste, cuñao
Y por mí pregúntele
Ni se le ocurra decir
Que viene pa´ visitarme
Diga que viene a cobrarme

Y lo han de dejar pasar
Allá le van a indicar
Que siga los ucalitos
Al final, está un ranchito
Que han levantao estas manos
Esa es su casa, paisano
Ahí puede pegar el grito 
Allá le voy a mostrar
Mi mancarrón, mis dos perros

Unas espuelas de fierro
Y un montón de cosas más
Si es entendido, verá
Un poncho de fina trama
Y el retrato de mi Mama
Que es ande rezo pensando
Mientras lo voy adornando
Con florcitas de retama
¿ Qué puede ofertarle un pión

Que no sean sus pobrezas
A veces me entra tristeza
Y otras veces, rebelión
En más de alguna ocasión
Quisiera hacerme perdiz
Para ver de ser feliz
En algún pago lejano
Pero a la verdad, paisano
Me gusta el aire de aquí",Milonga del Peon de Campo
Atahualpa Yupanqui,"El árbol que tú olvidaste siempre se acuerda de ti
Y le pregunta a la noche 
Si serás o no feliz

El arroyo me ha contado 
Que el árbol suele decir
Quien se aleja junta quejas 
En vez de quedarse aquí

Al que se va par el mundo 
Suele sucederle así
Que el corazón va con uno 
Y uno tiene que sufrir
Y el árbol que tú olvidaste 
Siempre se acuerda de ti

Arbolito de mi tierra 
Yo te quisiera decir 
Que lo que a muchos les pasa 
También me ha pasado a mi

No quiero que me lo digan 
Pero lo tengo que oír
Quien se aleja junta quejas 
En vez de quedarse aquí",El  Árbol Que Tu Olvidaste
Atahualpa Yupanqui,"Pescador de mar adentro 
Mi amigo siempre cantaba
Un día volvió su copla 
Con el adiós de la barca

Vi correr sangre minera 
Por un pan endurecido
Junto á la mano crispada 
La luna se volvió trigo

No me dé penas la vida
Me sobra con la que tengo
Como el quebracho del monte 
Sobre el hachazo florezco

Trabaja el indio en la piedra 
Su socavón de silencio
Y á su sombra se cobija 
Mi corazón cancionero

Lo siento gemir al viento 
Cruzando montes de espinas
Salgo al camino y le grito 
Para servirle de guía

Allá por el cielo arriba 
Va la luna lastimada
Como una copla perdida 
Que ya no tiene guitarra

Trabaja el indio en la piedra 
Su socavón de silencio
Y á su sombra se cobija 
Mi corazón cancionero",La Copla
Atahualpa Yupanqui,"Yo tengo tantos hermanos 
Que no los puedo contar
En el valle, la montaña
En la pampa y en el mar

Cada cual con sus trabajos
Con sus sueños, cada cual
Con la esperanza adelante
Con los recuerdos detrás

Yo tengo tantos hermanos 
Que no los puedo contar

Gente de mano caliente 
Por eso de la amistad
Con uno lloro, pa llorarlo
Con un rezo pa rezar
Con un horizonte abierto 
Que siempre está más allá
Y esa fuerza pa buscarlo 
Con tesón y voluntad

Cuando parece más cerca 
Es cuando se aleja más
Yo tengo tantos hermanos 
Que no los puedo contar

Y así seguimos andando 
Curtidos de soledad
Nos perdemos por el mundo
Nos volvemos a encontrar

Y así nos reconocemos 
Por el lejano mirar
Por la copla que mordemos
Semilla de inmensidad

Y así, seguimos andando 
Curtidos de soledad
Y en nosotros nuestros muertos 
Pa que nadie quede atrás

Yo tengo tantos hermanos 
Que no los puedo contar
Y una novia muy hermosa 
Que se llama ¡Libertad!",Los Hermanos
Atahualpa Yupanqui,"Hay un aromo nacido 
En la grieta de una piedra
Parece que la rompió 
Pa' salir de adentro de ella

Está en un alto pela'o
No tiene ni un yuyo cerca
Viéndolo solo y florido 
Tuito el monte lo envidea

Lo miran a la distancia 
Árboles y enredaderas
Diciéndose con rencor
Pa uno solo, cuánta tierra

En oro le ofrece al sol 
Pagar la luz que le presta
Y como tiene de más
Puña'os por el suelo siembra

Salud, plata y alegría
Tuito al aromo, la suebra 
Asegún ven los demás 
Dende el lugar que lo observan

Pero hay que dar y fijarse 
Como lo estruja la piedra
Fijarse que es un martirio 
La vida que le envidean

En ese rajón, el árbol 
Nació por su mala estrella
Y en vez de morirse triste 
Se hace flores de sus penas

Como no tiene reparo
Todos los vientos le pegan
Las heladas lo castigan 
L'agua pasa y no se queda

Ansina vive el aromo 
Sin que ninguno lo sepa
Con su poquito de orgullo 
Porque es justo que lo tenga

Pero con l'alma tan linda 
Que no le brota una queja
Que en vez de morirse triste 
Se hace flores de sus penas

¡Eso habrían de envidiarle 
Los otros, si lo supieran",El  Aromo
Atahualpa Yupanqui,"Era una cinta de fuego
Galopando, galopando
Crin revuelta en llamaradas
Mi alazán te estoy nombrando

Trepo las sierras con luna
Cruzó los valles nevando
Cien caminos anduvimos
Mi alazán te estoy nombrando

Qué oscuro lazo de nieve 
Te pialó junto al barranco 
Cómo fue que no lo viste 
Qué estrella andabas buscando 

En el fondo del abismo
Ni una voz para nombrarlo
Solito se fue muriendo
Mi caballo, mi caballo

En una horqueta de un tala 
Hay un morral solitario
Y hay un corral sin relinchos
Mi alazán te estoy nombrando

Si es como dicen algunos
Que hay cielos pal' buen caballo
Por ahí andará mi flete
Galopando, galopando

Oscuro lazo de nieve 
Te pialó junto al barranco
Cómo fue que no lo viste 
Qué estrella andabas buscando 

En el fondo del abismo
Ni una voz para nombrarlo
Solito se fue muriendo
Mi caballo, mi caballo",El Alazan
Atahualpa Yupanqui,"Engrillado y entre cuatro
Hombres de torvo mirar
Así cruce Buenos Aires 
Por cantar la libertad

Anchos portones se abrieron 
Para volverse a cerrar
Pabellones, pasadizos 
Y al fondo la oscuridad

Por mi mujer y mi niño 
Recé lo que se rezar
Mi guitarra clara y honda 
Sabe todo lo demás

Engrillado y entre cuatro, 
Hombres de torvo mirar
Así cruce Buenos Aires 
Por cantar la libertad

Duerme el tirano la siesta 
Con metralleta a la par
Por si pasa un inocente 
Cantando a la libertad",En Aquel Tiempo
Atahualpa Yupanqui,"Pregunto todas las noches 
A la estrella que te cuida
Si crecen flor de traiciones
En el jardín de tu vida

Ay, ay con mi mala estrella
Que juega con mi dolor
Parece que dice si 
Parece que dice no

Yo nada quiero pedirte 
Pero sin querer te pido
Cuando quieras que me mate 
Dame el puñal de tu olvido

Ay, ay con mi valentía 
Que poca cosa había sido
Yo no tengo miedo a nada 
Como le tengo a tu olvido

Anoche he tenido un sueno 
Que me ha dado que pensar
Soné que juntaba nieve 
Cerquita de tu rosal

Ay, ay que soy agorero
Pensando en el sueno aquel
No vuelvas a juntar nieve 
Que el rosal se va a perder
Sonar con rosas y nieve 
Desdichas suele traer",Mi Mala Estrella
Atahualpa Yupanqui,"Vengo a buscar mi caballo 
Para adornarme con el
Mañana saldré a los campos
Quien sabe si volveré

Quiero rastrear un recuerdo 
Pa'l sur, pa'l norte, no se
Que duro tiempo he vivido 
Que larga noche pase

Si busco rumbo en la tierra 
Seguro me perderé
Con la luz que llevo adentro 
Sera otra cosa tal vez

Antes que despunte el alba 
Despacio me alejare
Adiós mi viejo algarrobo
Quien sabe si volveré

Pucha que es largo el camino
No sirvo pa'andar de a pie
Por eso ensillo caballo
Para adornarme con el

Voy a rastrear un recuerdo
Pa'l sur , pa'l norte, no se",Vengo a Buscar Mi Caballo
Atahualpa Yupanqui,"Yo no le canto a la luna
Porque alumbra y nada mas,
Le canto porque ella sabe
De mi largo caminar.

Ay lunita tucumana
Tamborcito calchaquí,
Compañera de los gauchos
En las noches de Tafí.

Perdida en las cerrazones
Quien sabe vidita
Por donde andaré
Mas, cuando salga la luna,
Cantaré, cantaré.
A mi Tucumán querido
Cantaré, cantaré, cantaré.

Con esperanza o con pena
En los campos de Acheral
Yo he visto la luna llena
Besando el cañaveral.

En algo nos parecemos
Luna de la soledad,
Yo voy andando y cantando
Que es mi modo de alumbrar.",Luna Tucumana
Atahualpa Yupanqui,"Vidita, ya me voy 
De los pagos del Tucumán
En la Aconquija viene clareando
Vidita
Nunca te he de olvidar

Vidita, triste está 
Suspirando mi corazón
Y con el pañuelo, te voy diciendo
Vidita
Paloma, adiós adiós

Vidita, ya me voy 
Y se me hace que no hei volver
Malaya mi suerte tanto quererte 
Vidita
Y tenerte que perder

Malaya mi suerte tanto quererte
Viene clareando mi padecer

Al clarear yo me iré 
A mis pagos de Chasquivil
Y hasta las espuelas 
Te irán diciendo, vidita
No te olvides de mí

Zamba sí, penas no
Eso quiere mi corazón
Pero hasta la zamba 
Se vuelve triste, vidita 
Cuando se dice adiós",Viene Clareando
Atahualpa Yupanqui,"Caminito del indio
Sendero colla
Sembrao de piedras
Caminito del indio
Que junta el valle con las estrellas

Caminito que anduvo
De sur a norte
Mi raza vieja
Antes que en la montaña
La pachamama se ensombreciera

Cantando en el cerro
Llorando en el río
Se agranda en la noche
La pena del indio

El sol y la luna
Y este canto mío
Besaron tus piedras
Camino del indio

En la noche serrana
Llora la quena su honda nostalgia
Y el caminito sabe
Quién es la chola
Que el indio llama

Se levanta en el cerro
La voz doliente de la baguala
Y el camino lamenta
Ser el culpable
De la distancia

Cantando en el cerro
Llorando en el río
Se agranda en la noche
La pena del indio

El sol y la luna
Y este canto mío
Besaron tus piedras
Camino del indio",Camino del Indio [Canción]
Atahualpa Yupanqui,"Porque no engraso los ejes 
Me llaman abandona'o 
Si a mi me gusta que suenen
¿Pa qué los quiero engrasaos ?

E demasiado aburrido 
Seguir y seguir la huella
Demasiado largo el camino 
Sin nada que me entretenga

No necesito silencio
Yo no tengo en qué pensar
Tenía, pero hace tiempo
Ahora ya no pienso mas

Los ejes de mi carreta 
Nunca los voy a engrasar",Los Ejes de Mi Carreta [Milonga]
Atahualpa Yupanqui,"Tú crees que eres distinto
Porque te dicen poeta
Y tienes un mundo aparte

Porque te dicen poeta
Y tienes un mundo aparte
Más allá de las estrellas

De tanto mirar la luna
Ya nada sabes mirar
Eres como un pobre ciego
Que no sabe a dónde va

Vete a mirar los mineros
Los hombres en el trigal
Y cántale a los que luchan
Por un pedazo de pan

Poeta de ciertas rimas
Vete a vivir a la selva
Y aprenderás muchas cosas
Del hachero y sus miserias

Atahualpa Yupanqui,"Cruzando los salitrales 
Uno se muere de sed
Aquello es puro desierto 
Y allí no hay nada que hacer
Trabajo, quiero trabajo 
Porque esto no puede ser 
Un día veré al desierto 
Convertido en un vergel

El río es puro paisaje 
Lejos sus aguas se van
Pero mis campos se queman 
Sin acequias ni canal
Trabajo, quiero trabajo
Porque esto no puede ser
Un día veré a mi campo 
Convertido en un vergel

Las entrañas de la tierra 
Va el minero á revolver
Saca tesoros ajenos 
Y muere de hambre después

Trabajo, quiero trabajo 
Porque esto no puede ser
No quiero que nadie pase 
Las penas que yo pasé

Despacito, paisanito
Despacito y tenga fe
Que en la noche del minero 
Ya comienza á amanecer

Trabajo, quiero trabajo
Porque esto no puede ser","Trabajo, Quiero Trabajo [Canción]"
Atahualpa Yupanqui,"Un día, yo pregunté
""Agüelo, ¿ dónde está Dios ¿ ""
Me miró con ojos tristes
Y nada me respondió

Mi agüelo murió en los montes
Sin rezos, ni confesión
Y lo enterraron los indios
Flauta de caña y tambor

Otro día, yo pregunté
""Padre, ¿ qué sabe de Dios ¿ ""
Me miró con ojos tristes
Y nada me respondió

Mi padre murió en las minas
Sin rezos, ni confesión
¡color de sangre minera
Tiene el oro del patrón ¡

Mi hermano vive en los montes
Y no conoce la flor
Sudor, serpiente y malaria
Es vida del leñador

Y que naides le pregunte
Si sabe dónde está Dios
¡por su casa no ha pasado
Tan distinguido señor!

Yo canto por los caminos
Y cuando estoy en prisión
Oigo la voz del pueblo
Que canta mejor que yo

Hay una cosa en la vida
Más importante que Dios
Y es que naides escupa sangre
Pa' que otro viva mejor

Qué Dios ayuda a los pobres 
Tal vez sí, o tal vez no
¡pero es seguro que almuerza
En la mesa del patrón",La Preguntitas
Atahualpa Yupanqui,"Volver a los diecisiete
Después de vivir un siglo
Es como descifrar signos
Sin ser sabio competente
Volver a ser de repente
Tan frágil como un segundo
Volver a sentir profundo
Como un niño frente a Dios
Eso es lo que siento yo
En este instante fecundo

Se va enredando, enredando
Como en el muro la hiedra
Y va brotando, brotando
Como el musguito en la piedra
Ay sí sí sí

Mi paso retrocedido
Cuando el de ustedes avanza
El arco de las alianzas
Ha penetrado en mi nido
Con todo su colorido
Se ha paseado por mis venas
Y hasta las duras cadenas
Con que nos ata el destino
Es como un diamante fino
Que alumbra mi alma serena

Lo que puede el sentimiento
No lo ha podido el saber
Ni el más claro proceder
Ni el más ancho pensamiento
Todo lo cambia el momento
Cual mago condescendiente
Nos aleja dulcemente
De rencores y violencias
Solo el amor con su ciencia
Nos vuelve tan inocentes

El amor es torbellino
De pureza original
Hasta el feroz animal
Susurra su dulce trino
Detiene a los peregrinos
Libera a los prisioneros
El amor con sus esmeros
Al viejo lo vuelve niño
Y al malo solo el cariño
Lo vuelve puro y sincero

De par en par en la ventana
Se abrió como por encanto
Entró el amor con su manto
Como una tibia mañana
Al son de su bella diana
Hizo brotar el jazmín
Volando cual serafín
Al cielo le puso aretes
Y mis años en diecisiete
Los convirtió el querubín",Volver a los 17 [Sirilla Cancion]

I forgot to call you in the wintertime
Like the waves crash coming right
i've got feelings pouring down against the ceiling
While you try to trace which side i'm on

When the wind blows between us
High above this empty feeling 
I don't want to stop 
I don't want to stop
When the waves crash beneath us 
Down below this empty feeling 
I don't want to stop 
I don't want to stop

Can we dance like everything's alright 
Can we trade the day in for the night 
Like a homesick tunneling 
I'm not breathing till I leave with you believing
I don't want to trace another song

How many times have you tried
To mount the pieces of my broke-broken heart

Don't tell me everything's over
Don't take the sun from my eye

When our love grows old
And the flower gets cold

'Til there is no room to die

When the colors fade, on the what we've made
I will keep on trying, long after the flame is dying

Too wide to keep it inside

Like the autumn leaves

Over bright highways where the traffic was the only sound

You know she's never gonna ask you, if you feel the same
A fever oh an addiction uh, was it worth it did you give your life away?

A fever a desperate religion, and all that she can say is

Give me just a little bit, uh
Gimme just a little bit

A train that never stops rolling it?s getting into your blood
A need that never stops growing she's a poisonous one
A hope for better days but nothing, oh
Seems to fix it, uh, now you're wasting way

A desperate addiction
A familiar affliction

State of mind, so don't stay close

I feel, I feel so alive
Meet me at the station or maybe in another life
I feel, I feel so alive
There'll be no more drifting back and forth in time

Another day, another life
To feed with all that I call mine
Is what it takes, so I go out tonight

Shining lights of crossing cars
An open sky, a million stars
They open up my eyes and this is just because

I feel, I feel so alive
Meet me at the station or maybe in another life
I feel, I feel so alive
There'll be no more drifting back and forth in time

I'll take it slow

ATB,"At a time, in situations
When you want a thing more than you should
You would fall, you would crumble
By picking up the pieces from the storm

That was when you said you least expect it
That was when you asked, ""How did we get this far?"" So far
That was when I wanted to correct it
But I guess there's nothing wrong with being wrong at all

And I can't do it any other way
Repeat and do it all the same way
And I won't justify
One more time

And I can't do it any other way
Repeat every single word we said
And I won't justify
One more time

And it's fine to complicate it
Complicated's all I've ever known
I was there, did you see me?
Frozen in a flash, put on the wall

Now is when I guess I least expect it
But I will never ask, ""How did we get this far?"" My God
Even if I doubt for just a second
I can still find the right in being wrong, so wrong

And I can't do it any other way
Repeat and do it all the same way
And I won't justify
One more time

And I can't do it any other way
Repeat every single word we said

Or laugh out loud the best we can
Let's meet the comfort of convenience
And search a silence deep within

Let's take a minute just to slip away
And linger here before it's gone

Would you know what I'm thinking and why I'm ashamed
Of the girl I am and the stranger that I became
Hold tight to the heart of an angel you'll never know
'Cause her face looks a little like mine
And it keeps you going just knowing I'm here tonight

Let me free your inner child
Let me sit inside your silence
Let me ease the hurt you hide

'Cause I'm alive, I'm unlucky
I'm a line too fine to trace
But I could be your consolation
If you'd be my saving grace

My wild world is the shape of a sound that can't be heard
But it rings when I'm unraveled by you
There's a quiet storm and my skin gets torn and I wake brand new
Higher and brighter than yesterday
But I'm still a dark, mysterious night
When the sun descends and the moon leads you to my side

So let me fall, let me love you
Let me free your inner child
Let me sit inside your silence
Let me ease the hurt you hide

'Cause I'm alive, I'm unlucky

Siendo la ilusión de mis sentidos,

Cerca del panal de las abejas,
No volará en la noche.
Ya no veré más sus párpados abiertos,
Ay, ya no sé lo que siento en la garganta,
Ay, ya ni sé lo que rueda en mi cabeza.
Ella soñó con ella,
Viéndose morir en mi regazo,
Ella se fué una tarde,
Puso su carita entre las alas,
No volará en la noche.
Ya no será más los ojos
De mis sueños,
Ay, yo no sé lo que siento
En las orejas,
Ay, ya no sé por qué me
Tiemblan las piernas.
Ella me trajo su alma
Why yo desmembré su corazón,
Ella me entregó el mundo,
Why yo me quedé petrificado,
No volará en la noche.
Ay, no valió encerrarla en
Una jaula,
Ay, no llegó a quererme
Con el alma,
Ay, ya ni said, aunque yo
Coma salado.

Atheist,"Take a piece of life in hand, you know that life is yours
Indulgence, everlasting rage escaping through your pores
Day by day it grows so close, intensify the end
You know the day will come, we go beyond the end

What's in store, we fear no more, a blaze of ritual fire
Accept a form of life unknown by death, I am inspired
Hoping for a place of worship to pardon all my sins
This is where your life will end, beyond begins

Become at one with death it self and see where it will lead
Escaping from domestic, self-inflicted greed
Hoping for forgiveness, can you take the pain much more?
Soon your life will know just what's in store

Craving life beyond the end
To no avail, put down your blackened veil
Assuming that your life was pure
Immense disease for which there is no cure",Beyond
Atheist,"I deny your wretched lifestyle

Politician, I see through your charade
Speaking all your brainless lies, you're all the same
Mister preacher, tell me what is right
Send the double figures, son, you'll see the light

will they have a tax on nature?
How much more will still remain?
They actually call themselves humane

I deny all you see
I don't have to belief

It's god's way, says your horrid wife

Embezzling, indulging

I see right through you
Soon they all will too",I Deny
Atheist,"Numbness, see your fingers turn purple, would you rather burn?
Catching your breath, I'll let you choose your death
Cast your life of agony, I'll dump your body in the sea
I'll drown you while laughing, you know I will destroy you
If chainsaws are your fantasy, I'll cut your body into three
Slicing and grinding, you know that life's not binding
So strangulation is your game, you know I always please to maim
My service to you, to watch your face turn blue

I know your mind, it must be yielding, I'll throw you off a real-tall
Building
You can't be found, you're splattered on the ground
I'll still your wrist and let you die, you know they'll call it suicide
Blood on the ceiling, I know how you are feeling
If you'd like to be cremated or maybe decapitated
Speak up now or I'll decide just how
Now you've waited way too long, I knew your mind was not that strong
You've list your chance, so I will choose your death",Life

No mercy or no fear
The sound of twisting flesh

Spilling your remains' arrogance
Thinking of a way you will die
Rip through your flesh and through your bones, obey
See you lying limbless, you'll decay
Fall amongst the dead, on they slay

Eargerness to kill, the meager presence of their sight
You know your blood will spill, your end's tonight
Praying to be saved, now where's your god?

Infest your putrid mind
Death calls start tot unwind
Beware, for some day soon
They'll come to seal your doom

Its classroom, our earth, enlightenment it yearns
Receiving the life and knowledge it deserves
A spectrum of warmth, a soul is life-preserved

Please don't think that when you die
You'll spend eternity up high
When what you really ought to know
Is just how far your life will go

Another notch in a cosmic climb
Reveal our sanity, reveal your plan divine
To grasp reality is to grasp your biggest fear, you see
Every circumstances is very meant to be

Is your life not the life that you want it to be?
Your soul is young, it lacks response to the things you see

Some must learn the hard way, but that's what they need
When all is learned in this life, your soul will proceed

Or to some of you that may be half-dead
I.V. machines running to my veins
Man-made life restores my withered remains
A mirror of sorts appears before my being
My human end has come, that's all that I see

Now that my soul it set free
I'm classified dead now, it seems
My destiny plunders on through
I'm granted a room with a view

Nurses and interns gathering at my side
I try to yell at them, I haven't died
As I project, my soul emerges from fear
I soon remember all the reasons I'm here

How strange, I thought that I could see myself
A different light, sight, sound and smell

A different experience, a new world
Almost unhuman to me
See them cart me away
I venture to a new day
Human inhibitions are gone

Wake up and realize this brutal sin

Unholy war
Thought to pray for
Plaguing scandal
Unholy war

Religion pays in godly ways, education's not a factor
Sit there brainwashed, insecurity
Preaching life and immortality

Criminal in their ways
To reach eight million in just thirty days
Thrive on mindless human beings

No, nothing's changed, it still remains

Octogenarian leaders
Telling us they would

I know that there's got to be a way

Meaningful ends and the thrill of it all
To be an equal of infinity's divine
Searching the cosmos for erected confines
Bursting within the motherland

That I see

Man's existence is to form resistance
The timeless reluctance
The all forgotten purpose
Your spectacle of actions
Is the tell tale of my visions
Oh now I, see it clear
You wish to be relieved
Of all fear

Prepare your senses

You say things

A thought of fame and wealth

A caravan or process if you will
A stream of conscious waves
A prostitute of ideas
A maze of tracing knowledge
First and foremost feed your head !

Retrieve all that flows with memory
Obtain all you know with sensories
Approaching every act with contemplation
Attacking every-vision with indecision
Conditioning is a routine of minds
Recruiting all the intellect it finds
Insecurity is merely your fear
Of maybe the outside hearing what you hear
Can't let 'em see,
Don't let 'em hear
Projecting like an airplane in flight

I dream of things
That just aren't quite right
A projector shines on the back of my eyes

Tarnished, are the thoughts

That you do to me
Cause a stone'll happen to you

Think before you say your sorry
Think before it's too late, stop wasting time

Will never happen so you better think
If you treat me right I'm gon make you happy

I've fooled around too long
Now all I think about is you 
And what we used to have

I'm scared to live without your love
'Coz you were really all I had
Now my only love has gone away

Is you, is you
Is you, baby

You cared for me so much
So much you scared me boy

Head on down to Hollywood

Athlete,"Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah, ah

Follow her down to a bridge by the fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high.

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds 
And you're gone.

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.",Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds

[Rap:]
I'm the one you done heard all the rumors about
You vibrate like my cellie how you movin around
In that new gear fresh off the Lesiango runway
Lets go to St.Barts Sunday to Sunday
Your nails done and them braids all twisted
If you got a flaw, I guess I just missed it
I'm not easy to reach, my digits unlisted
Come closer but don't stain with your lipstick

[1st Verse:]
Been around the world
Seen so many girls
But none have moved me quite the way she does
And I've done some things
With some qhetto queens
It was just for fun but now I think I'm in love

I can't stop thinking 'bout her
She's everywhere that I go does she know I just can't live without her
Whoa she
She's taking over me
I can't control how she turns me on so much
Without a single touch

[Chorus:]
Shorty your the one
Your the only girl I need
Only one I want
Only girl that's meant for me
Got me open
Baby girl let me know
If you want to go

[2nd Verse:]
You're a winner so you gotta be choosy
'Cause you can't love everybody
I live my life like a movie
Act like you know somebody
Gonna give you what you need babe
Already told you you're the star of the t.v.
There's nothing else you need to know
So come on get on board

You're the one I'm diggin
And I guess I'm hoping that you're catching the same feelings
Let me know
'Cause you're my favorite girl
In the whole wide world
Yeah you're so fine
I gotta make you mine

[Chorus repeat]
Let me say it again
You're the one I'm diggin
And I guess I'm hoping that you're catching the same feelings
Let me know
'cause you're my favorite girl
In the whole wide world
Yeah you're so fine
I gotta make you mine

[Rap:]
Like rocky road my chain be all chunky
High School thought that I failed since they flunked me
Now I'm in XXL its so funny
High Schools double my sales, I'm gettin money (get your money money money)
Like my bunny's pretty with pierced tummy's
Call me pooh bear how I'm baggin all the honeys
They sick to the point that they noses gettin runny
Why'all freeze on the ave. 
I recline where it's sunny

Can't stop thinking 'bout her
She's everywhere that I go does she know I just can't live without her
Whoa she
She's taking over me
I can't control how she turns me on so much
Without a single touch

Bring that part back man
You're the one I'm diggin
And I guess I'm hoping that you're catching the same feelings
Let me know

You gotta understand that, why'knaw I mean?
If you gon' keep it real wit me
I think we gon' be ight
You know, why'knaw I mean, but, 
One thing you always gotta remember is how we started
It's both of us
We'll be straight dogg

We met eachother through mutual friends 
Since it sparked off, you my next ta kin
Is it your silky skin 
Ya' innocent grin
Or them curves and tha way that chu' been
Whatever it is, you got me glad that I took notice
When times hopeless
Your words helped me stay focused
I was once told, never trust a diva
I usually toss 'em like the crust of a pizza
But now my sixth sense tell me ta keep her
We livin' lavida
In our own world like cita
I'll let you sport mah chain, rock mah hat,
Wear mah jersey, watch mah back
It took a lot for you to earn my trust
You wanna roll wit a boss?
Then trust is a must
So lets skip all the fightin' and fuss
Forget about them, it's us

Girl it's us, nothing's gon' change it, that's a fact
Even if ya' girls ain't down for that
And even if the fellas ain't got my back

Nomatter what they say we'll try
And even if the hate, we'll ride

They say you get what you pay for
That's why I'd rather pay more
And keep you in them wears, shortys slice ya' face for
They get tha knock off's, you get the real Louis
That's one of the benefits of gettin' close to me
Down for three years ain't nuttin come between
Expirienced things you never thought you woulda' seen
I took you off the scene
Sold you a dream
You bought that wit out no cream
We a match made, like george and weezie
Lucy and ricky, ike and tina, bobby and whitney
And if shit hit the fan, you comin' wit me
I won't take the stand, they gotta' come and get me
Ain't no limit to what I would do
Cause true love strikes only one in a few
You might think it's too good to be true
But it ain't up to me, (Ohhh girl) it's up to you

Girl it's (it's us) us, nothing's gon' change it, that's a fact (that's right, yeah)

I'm in it to win it

Nomatter if they gossipin' out loud or whisperin'
Smile in our face, but behind our backs snickerin'
And when we bickerin' they use that to tear us apart
It's obvious they got hate in they heart
I told you from the start, overhere we livin splendid
Amount that they make in a year, we get ta spend it
And we'll be movin' ahead when they finish (girl it's us)

With a bible in his hand
And he'd talk about religion
And just how to work the land

Atlanta Rhythm Section,"Normal love
I need some normal love
Not a sickness, nor madness
Just an everyday affair
But just like an old fashion love song
These days it's rare
Outer space
These days that's commonplace
If it's storybook, or strange
It's the passion of the day
Caught up in that old cosmic circle
So out of place
Normal love
Make it sweet, make it simple
Ooh, that's what I need
Just a smile, just a kiss
Normalness
What a twist
I need your normalness
I'd forget you if I could
And normally I would

She said ""come with me babe, we shall overcome""
She said ""excuse me while I kiss the sky
You see, some folks were going to die
I was born to run""

It wasn't something that you've got to explain

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed

Atlantic Starr,"This song is just a simple little message
There's no heavy thing
It's just a mere reminder for those of us who
Sometimes forget just how good we are

Life is something we pretend to take for granted
We've gotta it so good that we're hard to satisfy
It would be so nice if we lead towards appreciation
It's not hard if just we try

You should tell the child that only has bread and butter
That some folks have no bread at all
And the man that has no fortune
That hasn't still found someone to love
He should stand just as tall

That's why I'm thankful for every morning that I rise
I'm thankful whether God sends rain or blue sky
I'm thankful 'cause I can clearly see
His love for you and me

Hey, looking back through the years when I was very young
I used to dream of becoming a star
Even though I was [Incomprehensible], I was patient because of you
In time I would grow fine

There were many obstacles that were in my way
I could have done bad things and been locked away
But with lot of attention from my family
Success is seen this day

I'm thankful for every morning that I rise
I'm thankful whether God sends rain or blue sky
I'm thankful 'cause I can clearly see
His love for you and me

If we only stop to count our blessings
We'll find that there will be no time to complain
Oh, what we don't have, that's not the best thing
'Cause the most important things in life we can always gain

That's why I'm thankful
Thankful, thankful

A little faded but baby you sure do look good in that old dress, oh yes

Atmosphere,"She got a condition of the heart
A heart condition
So as a kid she had to adapt to smarter living
Not much room to rebel because of health
No drugs, no booze, just kiss and tell
Well known on the scene
Jail bait queen
Had the first baby barely eighteen
Father of the child was after one thing
When the daughter came the dad was unseen
It don't matter he ain't got a job
So she had to go to work and leave the baby with her mom
Second shift till the neck is stiff
But she worked it and built her own nest to live
Soon after that baby's daddy slash lazy bunk
With no cash he want to come over and crash
He want to play his part
So she let him move in to that garden level apartment
She knew better she did it anyways
Explain better when your trying to see some better days
The suns up catch those rays
Butterfly style who's got chase

[Chorus: x2]
But she still dreams after she woke
Tight hold on that hope
Sometimes it can seem so cold
Do what you got to do to cope

Two years later two months pregnant
Same daddy same broke ass situation
This time the doc said that her heart might break
Praise god that the job got her health benefits straight
She believes in the right to choice
But she loves baby girl and she wants a boy
Makes more now a days on the day-shift
Balance that with night class
Take some time and space and make it all fit
The apartment they now live in is overcrowded
Raised her voice and made her point
Told that boy go get employed
He put on his best shirt
Said he wasnt coming back till he gets work
She knew what that part meant
So she swept every piece out that apartment
Peace out keep out
Take the scenic route
Rather only have to feed three mouths
She adapts to everything know
And nobody asks what she dreams out

[Chorus: x2]

Little girl was the first reason to breathe
And the little man was the first man she believed in
She gotta live right and do right by self
She do for self she don't want your help
Afraid of being alone
But fear ain't enough to knock her off of that stone
Gonna make that home her home
With or without a man that she can call her own
Big boss at work is anxious
Continues to hand her the wrong advances
She passes the test
She knew the answers
Quit the job to go take a chance
With life
This is life we all scream
While we pray for dollars and we work for change
Its all the same, we all struggle
Sometimes you gotta say fuck you
When you smile and she doesn't return it
Give her room and don't disturb it
If it makes it hurt less to curse and fight
Go ahead and hate the world girl you've earned the right

[Chorus: x3]",The Dreamer
Atmosphere,"When I first landed the damage was outlandish
anguish, anxiousness, and taking it for granted
but when I first landed I was so relieved I lost my focus
so we exceeded recommended dosages
now I hold the crib? that holds the soul that holds the poet skills
exlcusive it leaves illusions of unfocused flows
I don't suppose you're taking too much time
breaking too much mind trying to unravel the parable?
that dismantled and left the lines in need of some assembly
so I can find the secret key and free all the emcees
this planet spins on a thin axis
all axis passes won't help you to grasp the atmos'
I mean, what did you think
my agenda was to freestyle, smile, get paid to smoke weed,
and grab the mic and spoonfeed?
there's more to this than just paying the rent
if you're riding on this song you need to ride it to the end

[Chorus]
what could you say as the Earth gets further and further away?
planets as small as balls of clay (x4)

some shells get broke
some keep their wigs closed
some get exposed as little man big pose
some make moves and some stay daydreamers
but everbody seems to want some loot, food amd a beemer
well make mine hunter green with camel insides,
10 percent tips, Mr. Pibb and some french fries
inch by inch I take it closer to the shoulder
but day by day it's getting harder to stay sober
once again on the edge, head's inebriated
movement needs motive, it's easier to be sedated
what makes me mighty and another tiny?
why does my psyche give a damn about whether or not you like me?
if this crime's right I might be wrong
I grip this mic tight because it's all I really have a grip on
so let the losers lose and let the players play
the difference is the day to the dust some clay, what

[Chorus - 4X]

who's world is that? it ain't mine, and I'm grateful
already got a plate full of clay on my table
I'm capable of handling fate, I know this
so do the people that get pissed when this microphonist spits
too many get caught up in the lines that emcees thought up
but it's clear to me the ones that fear me are the one's that outta
I spot a blemish on your planet's existence
I deliver subtle terror submerged in clever sentences
instantly pissin? away the misfits
the only residue that came of the hypothecially spew they sprayed
when they swayed I'd have em
half of 'em can't fathom
where the 'Mats? from
I may be on those
you can ask 'em
at last, when we get down to it
there's more than sand and fluid
in how I revolve and evolve
can we solve the secrets? No.
can we take trinkets? No.
so when the ink hits it's more than just a sequenced flow
I can't bring you with me so I'm a leave me here
centuries from now they're gonna study Atmosphere
carefully I steer, I'm aware life is fatal
when I go, I want to go like Ho, taken by the play-dough

[Chorus - 4X]",Clay
Atmosphere,"I used to know this woman
Who had the most beautiful tattoos
On the top sides of both of her hands
She was forty-three years old and as far as I know
Had never yet been with a man

It's not that she wasn't attractive
She was beautiful but it was the way that she interacted
She was aggressively passive to the point
Where she would've intimidated any mitt
That ever tried to catch it

On the right hand she had a tattoo of a nude girl
She claimed it is what God resembled
But on the left she had a mirrored image of the same female
And this one she explained looked like the devil

I remember once watching her touch her own breasts
How the tattoos smiled as they stared down her stomach
As if anticipating when they'd be allowed to caress
The sweet flower that they both seemed to hunger
(Sweet flower)

Now maybe I was high but it felt so right
Heaven and Hell both take to this woman's womb
It didn't make sense how she could commence
Touching herself with me wide awake in the same room

But if I've learned anything in my years
(My years)
I learned I no longer believe in surprise
(In surprise)
But what happened next damn near stoled my tears

The tattoos came alive right in front of my eyes
They both slowly stood up and climbed off her hands
And showed me why she never took some time with a man
They climbed deep inside of this woman's garden

She closed her eyes and she gently bit her bottom lip
I stepped I left and I don't regret leaving
And I'll never forget all the things I saw that evening
A glimpse of religion a piece of coming closer
To understanding more about what intrigues me most

I didn't get turned on I just got turned
I wasn't as aroused as I was concerned
For each one of 'em I've hurt and every time I've been burned
I've got a lot to teach but even more to learn

So now I keep my eyes open hoping to take in all I can
About women taking in all she can
And for as long as I breathe I'll save receipt
In my memory for that woman with the tattooed hands

There's good and evil in each individual fire
Identifies needs and feeds our desire
As long as we keep our spirit inspired
She can bite her bottom lip all she wants

There's good and evil in each individual fire
Identifies needs and feeds our desire
As long as we keep our spirit inspired
She can bite her bottom lip all she wants

There's good and evil in each individual fire
Identifies needs and feeds our desire
As long as we keep our spirit inspired
She can bite her bottom lip all she wants

Voices in the box guarantee a better product
So here I sit now, and watch em trip out
Trying to pick a finger to put upon what its about
But if there was a point, you would still avoid
You should've taught the boys and girls how to take apart their toys

submerged in the drama 'cause they love it
That if they can hold the pain, and then they complain

Why would you chase away the sun if you don't want the rain?
I never asked for the world, just a portion
Tryin to make a good soldier out of daddy's little orphan

How many wishes get spent on what you ain't got?

Tryin to keep it movin, while you're sittin in the same spot
Been in this cage for a long time (long time)
Been coverin this page with the wrong rhymes (wrong rhymes)
Got a strong mind, I got a weak will
I've got bad nerves and I can't keep still
But I stay humble, so when the meek take the planet
I can get a little piece with my name on it
The only problem is by then I won't want it
I'm in the backyard praying and hoping for the comet
Are you lookin to remember or searchin for adventure?
I guess it all depends on the agenda
Do you carry a grudge? Do you carry a gun?
I guess it all depends on where you come from
Surroundings are gonna dictate the needs
I'm out, I want to live around lakes and trees
And I'll be back when its happy hour
So just pour me another and ignore me my brother

But on a regular basis it's safe to say I've got the benz
And I didn't mean to ignore that vibe you sent
I guess my mind was probably on my rent
Oh I got my mind on my tummy, and my tummy on my mind

Until lunch time it's crunch time, back to work

For my son to page through, thinking daddy was a gun
With a handful of heads that put me up
til they had some samples from Ant, and faith in What the Fuck?

After that show, when you approached me like you know me

On that world you vision, through the layers of tears
The ones you choke and keep hidden when the players are near
I watch you chase it with beer, some frustration and fear
Try to figure out why the hell I came here
Well I don't know either, and I'm not ready to take a breather, neither

So you can beat me up, or you can beat me off
Pick a side, any side, and let me do my job, come on

she said she's 21 and quit school to go work for the man
A switch up in the plan, now she's happy as a chorus

I wonder if she knows that I'm not really a star
She seems to be impressed with my lack of an ego and
my self-aware style, I like the way that she smiles

A captain? You mean a man at home? The answer is no
I came to this bar alone
Well heaven's to Betty, enough about boyfriends already
just tryin to keep the conversation petty
As much as I would love to run and play in the forest
ain't no way this girl is gonna break into my fortress

I've never made a practice, of introducing the mattress
to women that I meet at my own gig

alcohol and hormones turning out to be anything big
Baby's hella beautiful, even kinda bright
I've got the fire of a vampire inside me tonight
It might be alright, everything seems tight
I've got a good buzz and she's giving me the green light
So tell me girl, what you doin after?
She says hopefully hangin out with my new favorite rapper
Now wait a minute, that's not fair, you're throwin boulders
I can tell by the way your hair touches your shoulders
Be straight with me and I'll be mean with you
I can think of some of us that we should do
So if you think I'm coming home with you tonight
you're probably right(probably right)
A few more beers, a couple more laughs,
undressing my past with the questions she asked
Yes, I love cats and I would love to take a bath
If I would spend the night, would you massage my back?

She's closin in for the embrace
and slightly tucks her head under my face
her hair smells so good, I gotta have a taste
where's your Ford, let's ditch this place
In the parking lot, she sparked it off
she must be starving for someone to hit the heart
I've never been kissed with such passionate bliss

leave this garage, lets go to your apartment

Atmosphere,"Â??Dungeons and Dragonsâ?? by Dr. Demento

Narrator: Dungeons and Dragons, Satan's game. Your children like it or not, are attracted in their weaker years to the Occult and a game like D+D fuels their imagination and makes them feel special, while drawing them deeper and deeper into the bowels of El Diablo. This afternoon the Dead Alewives watch tower invites you to sit in on an actual gaming session. Observe the previously unobservable as a hidden camera takes you to the inner sanctum of Dungeons and Dragons

Graham: Galstaff you have entered the door to the north. You are now by yourself standing in a dark room, the pungent stench of mildew emanates off the wet dungeon walls.

Nightblade: Where are the Cheetos!

Graham: They're right next to you.

Galstaff: I cast a spell.

Nightblade: Where's the Mountain Dew!

Graham: In the Fridge. DUH!

Galstaff: I wanna cast a spell.

Nightblade: Can I have a Mountain Dew!

Graham: Yes, you can have a Mountain Dew just go get it.

Galstaff: I can cast any of these right, on the list?

Graham: Yes, any any of the first level ones.

Nightblade: I'm gonna get a soda, any one want one? Hey Graham I'm not in the room right?

Graham: What room?

Galstaff: I wanna cast magic missile.

Nightblade: The room where he's casting all these spells from!

Graham: He hasn't cast any thing yet.

Galstaff: I am though if you'd listen. I'm casting Magic Missile.

Graham: Why are you casting Magic Missile, there's nothing to attack here.

Galstaff: I- I- I'm attacking the darkness.

(laughing)

Graham: Fine fine you attack the darkness there's an elf in front of you.

Picard: Whoa! That's me right?

Graham: He's wearing a brown tunic and he has gray hair and blue eyes.

Picard: No I don't, I have gray eyes.

Graham: Let me see that sheet.

Picard: Well it says I have, well it says I have blue but I decided I wanted gray eyes.

Graham: Whatever, ok, you guys can talk now if you want.

Galstaff: Hello.

Picard: Hello.

Galstaff: I am Galstaff, Sorcerer of Light.

Picard: Then how come you had to cast Magic Missile?

(laughing)

Graham: why- why- why- You guys are being attacked.

Nightblade: Do I see that happening!?!

Graham: NO! You're outside by the tavern.

Nightblade: Cool, I get drunk!

Graham: Ugh. There are there are seven ogres surrounding you.

Picard: How can they surround us? I had Mordenkainens Magical Watch Dog cast!

Graham: No you didn't.

Nightblade: I'm getting drunk! Are there any girls there?

Picard: I totally did. You asked me if I wanted any equipment before this adventure, and I said no, but I need material components for all my spells, so I cast Mordenkainens Faithful Watch Dog.

Graham: But you never actually cast it.

Nightblade: Roll the dice to see if I'm getting drunk!

Graham: Ugh. Yeah you are.

Nightblade: Are there any girls there?

Graham: Yeah!

Picard: I did though; I completely said when you asked me...

Graham: No you didn't. You didn't actually say that you were casting the spell so now there's ogres. Ok.

Nightblade: OGRES!?! Man, I got an ogre slaying knife! It's got a +9 against ogres!

Graham: You're not there, you're getting DRUNK!

Nightblade: Ok, but if there's any girls there I wanna do them!

Narrator: There you have it. A frightening look into Americas most frightening past time. Remember that it's not you children's fault that's their being drawn into a satanic world of nightmare. It's their gym teachers fault for making them feel out cast when they couldn't do one single pull up.



",Dungeons and Dragons
Atmosphere,"""You see, what you mistake for madness is just over acuteness of the senses
And now it came to my ears a low, dull sound,
Such as a watch makes when wrapped in cotton,
I knew that sound too. It was the beating of the old man's heart.""

Man, I'm telling you some motherfuckers just have no kind of heart, man.
Serious man , motherfuckers man, these motherfuckers man, these motherfuckers have no self respect.
Don't wanna pay no dues, just wanna drop like a fucking LP tomorrow..
And then to top it off, these motherfuckers, they don't have no heart to their music, you know what I mean?
Sound like little girls and shit..

If you respect yourself [Repeat 5x]

[Slug]
Do you--
Now, it's started off rather basic,
Just some small scale davilin confined to the basement
Never knew I'd grow to this full time user
Never figured that I was a winner or a loser only did the due to have fun
And only got with a crew because it seemed natural to have one
Capture the life in the form of the grip around the mic hold it
Right like a love hold it tight with plight fortifies my
Existence reinforces my position in this course that I'm sticking to my path now
I can see it all laid out in my past while trying to catch what it's about in my last breath
Pull the toxins in, and I bet death's about to box me in, but before this bitch comes to get some,
I'mma do my job on this m-I-see, and feed you a thick one

[Chorus: Slug (Repeat 3x)]
You can have all the heart in the world, doesn't mean I'm gonna respect ya
I'm getting older and I'm knowing better

[Slug]
Let a, pissed rapper step to this captain and get up off your
Head kid, I'll bitch smack Hugh Hefners
Now, I'm about to put a (Slug) in
Show business and if everything goes right, I'm leaving no witness
I hold this inside the chest, so big it hardly fits it trips between a true fan of party
Shits quit to lace the track with substance for all the young guns that's really listening
At the functions so you can love it or leave it, fuck it or keep it, either way
I'll be here trudging through the deep shit
I've done well over hundred cuts and gotten the feed back of love
From some of the ones I've touched and thus, I'm not quitting never stop rippin' you gotta be kiddin' shit
He's on a mission is it possible the mics got my soul?
I'll make them all say ""Ho!"" and Rhymesayers
Rock the show let 'em know that it's more then a career goal
Cut that zero and let the hero in your ear hole, yo!

[Chorus: Slug (Repeat 3x)]
You can have all the heart in the world, doesn't mean I'm gonna respect ya
I'm getting older and I'm knowing better

[Slug]
Let a, piss rapper step to this captain get up off your head kid
I'll bitch smack Hugh Hefner emcees please excuse the ""you's"" and ""P's"" but I grew up on BDP, EPMD, Run-DMCs
I don't believe you should hold a mic and rolled up with a bus full of friend that think alike
I'm having a hard time trying to keep it simple just for the fuckers that don't seem to read between the ripples
It's all nipples and clits in this rap shit, catch a licking if you lay back passive bastard
It's like that y'all, it's like that y'all, art imitates life than most of it it's wack y'all
You gotta learn how to read the info the individual provides they probably won't dig me 'till I've died

Atmosphere,"Don't even know if I can write this song
Caught on a beam between right and wrong
Gotta keep forward, keep straight
For the sake of why we stay awake all night long
Its not up for interpret
Paranoid of exploiting the verdict
But in the same breath
I got thoughts that I wanna express and let surface
This ain't for props or the pop culture
Its about a balloon that got punctured
The sunshine'S fun til it burns someone
And we all got burnt that summer
She was sixteen.
Another young angel with clipped wings
She came to the shows
But I never met her, don't even know if she was listening
That night, we lost a supporter
That night, somebody lost their daughter
He raped and killed her at the venue
Can't comprehend what her friends must have went through
That night the sun went dark
Now watch everyone on the tourbus fall apart
That night, lord have mercy
The music died, that night, in Alberquerque

Stop, it can't be true right
This type of real deaont happen to you right?
Crescent, Murs, Dibbs, Jaybird
I wanna go home now and start a new life
Wish I could protect the kids
I guess safety's a hit or miss
With a prior convicted sex-offense against a 4 year old
Why we let you live?
Don't know what I'm trying to write
But there's a part of me that keeps dyin at night
When I think about her mother
I become another number that wants you to suffer
You're locked up for now, you have no more chances to steal the children's laughs
And if you ever find God
Better pray to her and ask that we never cross paths",That Night (Sunshine Blues)

You frustrated or something? Did you have a bad week?
Man, you got issues, I feel sorry for you
Yo, shittin' on me is so 2002, bitch

Turn your mic off, and turn the lights off
Who ever put your record out must have needed write offs
Who they play when the game's in a tight spot?
Slug, you can find me in the A's of your iPod

Watch out! When the crowd gets loud
It could burn up the roof or make the walls all fall down
Watch out! When you open up your mouth
I can smell that you don't know what you're talkin' about, it goes

Watch out! We all love a clown
But we don't wanna see you climb up out the underground
Watch out! If you don't like the sound
Fuck you! I'm just tryin' to put it down for my home town

Cars drive by with the boomin' system

And nowadays, every body's bitin' Tupac
So fuck it, I'ma stand over here and do the moonwalk

Besides police, I've got no beef

Enough rap to slap you to last week

Caught between the vice and the advice
Drunk, walkin' out in traffic just to fly kites
Time out, the free style rhyme out, my last rights
Fuck a classic album, give my life 5 mics

And when the smoke clears, you won't be able to suck dick

When I was younger, I wanted to be LL Cool J
Then he started makin' records for the girls and shit
So I ripped up the Kangol and threw it away

I stole moves from KRS One
A little Big Daddy Cane and some DJ Run
And then we took our life and made it a song
And look, nowadays Rhyme sayers is on

It's the be-I-G D-A double D-why S-E-A-N
He hasn't hit the rooftop to jump, guess he waitin'?
For what? I don't know, but who wanna come with me?

And there she blows, slip into the bathroom
Lock the door, sniffing like a vacuum
And I know that it ain't nobodies business
But last time she was in there for twenty minutes
Her roommate Ruth sitting at that booth
Sucking on that wine like she's gonna find the truth
Just wait 'till her lips turn blood red
She'll fall in love with whoever, 'nuff said
And that's Johnson
He's always on some agro frat bro gangsta stompin'
Acts like he's the only white boy from Compton
If real G's show up, the attitude is gone
Jill forgot that they agreed no coke
Cause Jacks on the couch passed out with his mouth open
Led Zepplin, Stairway To Heaven
Stay in step cause anyone can have a weapon
Just like Chad, real white trash
Short fuse quick to put his foot up your ass
Heads up, that's his wife Rebecca
And I advise you to try not to smile at her
And lets all have deep conversation
Alcohol and dialogue, perfect combination
Throw in a cokehead or a pothead
Just can't stop them thought provoking topics
Look somebody puked in the fridge
Ain't that great, it's where the beer lives
The music's too loud to hear the fire alarm
And I'ma set a fire if you don't change the song
C'mon

Nothing but love
Yeah there was a party, many people came through
Standing on the wall, cause that's what I do
Small-talk shot dialogue push snooze
Defense mechon cause I got a lotta shoes (issues)
The moment got stolen by a lady in red
With a campaign slogan about the straight edge
But her sentence is broken
Her focus a fraction
The ash on her Camels at an inch and a half
And her voice starts to crack
And her head starts to twitch
And Ant looks at me like, ""What's up with this bitch?""
I can tell by the stains and the way she complains
That pills ain't to blame and it ain't cocaine
She's had too, too, too much coffee

Nate must have drank a lot of Black Label
Tryin' to play the Rottwieler under the table
Now light another cigarette off of the stove
Both ya'll drunk, which one of ya'll drove?
These people need to stay off the sauce
I'm shocked that the neighbors ain't called the cops
The music, the drunk, the fights out front
And half of these kids ain't even near twenty one
Who's party is this, who's home is this?
How'd I get here man, I do grownup shit
Let me know when your games are all done
Cause I can't fuck with these games you call fun

Atmosphere,"Blue collar Eddie and his better half Delores used to be mantel pieces down at the Black Forest. 
And I don't know if that bar still exists, but when it did, so did they, a couple bleeding heart kids. 
Everything volatile, every night rocker style. Hop a stool, be discrete and just watch a while. 
But do your best to keep the level observational, drama is attractive so push it when it takes a pull. 
And each night's a random when you pay a ransom for the right to sing along with them drinking anthems. 
And these fools paid so many dues that everybody stops to salute. 

But one night after another fight a couple from an opposite table offered an invite. 
Dolores didn't want to join 'em, wasn't feeling social. 
But Eddie was so aggravated that he had to poke holes. 
He walked over, sat in the dialogue and called at Dolores like some kind of dog (hey girl come here)
She can't believe it, she's done, she's had it, but she doesn't want to make another scene in this establishment. 
She got up and mosied over, and put her arm up around Eddie's shoulder. 
Nobody's sober the song is the same; sometimes you stick out your chin to catch the rain.

You can be a winner, you can be a loser, gotta wake up when you hear the rooster.
Sometimes it's just too simple to live your life wrong, gotta do what right for you when the time comes.
You can be a winner, you can be a loser, gotta wake up when you hear the rooster.
Sometimes it's just too simple to live your life wrong, gotta do what right for you when the time comes.

The clock keeps drinking, they keep ticking. There's two more people who get to play positions. 
Samantha and Chuck; not a couple, just roommates; out having too many shots on a Tuesday. 
Who knew they'd be tools for the duo, put a little bit of fire on the fuel. 
It's a kinda blue, intentions ain't cruel, but everybody's so ready to bend up the rules.
Now there's Chuck, staring at Delores. 
Eddie is distracted by Samantha so he doesn't notice. 
And everybody's too fucked up to even asses the mess, much less care enough. 
More whiskey, a pitcher of Premium, Eddie's getting tipsy, he didn't see it comin. 
On his way back from a visit with that urinal, tryna straighten out his thoughts and the vertigo. 
Weaves through, stops when he's seen em. 
Picture perfect, it looked just like freedom.
Dolores on Chuck's lap kissing him hard. Eddie dipped into the winter left them all at the bar. 
Sometimes ya gotta follow what's felt inside; between the power struggle and the selfish pride. 
No one's allowed to cry unfair because now they both get to drink alone somewhere. 

You can be a winner, you can be a loser, gotta wake up when you hear the rooster
Sometimes it's just too simple to live your life wrong, gotta do what right for you when the time comes
You can be a winner, you can be a loser, gotta wake up when you hear the rooster
Sometimes it's just too simple to live your life wrong, gotta do what right for you when the time comes

A heart condition
So as a kid she had to adapt to smarter living
Not much room to rebel because of health
No drugs, no booze, just kiss and tell
Well known on the scene
Jail bait queen
Had the first baby barely eighteen
Father of the child was after one thing
When the daughter came the dad was unseen
It don't matter he ain't got a job
So she had to go to work and leave the baby with her mom
Second shift till the neck is stiff
But she worked it and built her own nest to live
Soon after that baby's daddy slash lazy bunk
With no cash he want to come over and crash
He want to play his part
So she let him move in to that garden level apartment
She knew better she did it anyways
Explain better when your trying to see some better days
The suns up catch those rays
Butterfly style who's got chase

[Chorus: x2]
But she still dreams after she woke
Tight hold on that hope
Sometimes it can seem so cold
Do what you got to do to cope

Two years later two months pregnant
Same daddy same broke ass situation
This time the doc said that her heart might break
Praise god that the job got her health benefits straight
She believes in the right to choice
But she loves baby girl and she wants a boy
Makes more now a days on the day-shift
Balance that with night class
Take some time and space and make it all fit
The apartment they now live in is overcrowded
Raised her voice and made her point
Told that boy go get employed
He put on his best shirt
Said he wasnt coming back till he gets work
She knew what that part meant
So she swept every piece out that apartment
Peace out keep out
Take the scenic route
Rather only have to feed three mouths
She adapts to everything know
And nobody asks what she dreams out

Little girl was the first reason to breathe
And the little man was the first man she believed in
She gotta live right and do right by self
She do for self she don't want your help
Afraid of being alone
But fear ain't enough to knock her off of that stone
Gonna make that home her home
With or without a man that she can call her own
Big boss at work is anxious
Continues to hand her the wrong advances
She passes the test
She knew the answers
Quit the job to go take a chance
With life
This is life we all scream
While we pray for dollars and we work for change
Its all the same, we all struggle
Sometimes you gotta say fuck you
When you smile and she doesn't return it
Give her room and don't disturb it
If it makes it hurt less to curse and fight
Go ahead and hate the world girl you've earned the right

He ain't picky once he puts his mac down
Make you suck it all the way to the ass now
Cause all of y'all heifers are cash cows
And at first it was just a little game
Had no idea that he was fucking with your brains

Shake you down
Make his mark
Take you down
Break your heart
And don't give a damn for anything that came apart
Some try anything to leave him
Say some even put themselves in treatment
Some get away but still gotta keep looking over they shoulder forever

He ain't scared of the law or the cops
Got em paid off some kind of trade off
Gonna stay in the pocket
As long as the money stays long and the hands stay strong
It's like you don't know a kid
He's right there in your clothes and hair
You never gonna let him in your home

Your lips taste like his dick
I can always tell when he's been in your whip
Just one in a million trick
Now take your ass outside and go talk to your pimp

Atmosphere,"I thought I saw you yesterday
But I didn't stop cause you was walking the opposite way
I guess I could have shouted out your name
But even if it was you I don't what I would say
We can sit and reminisce about the old school
Maybe share a cigarette because we both fools
Chop it up and compare perspectives
Life
Love
Stress
And set backs
Yes
You could tell me how hard you had it
And you could show me all the scares to back it
And we can analyze each complaint
Break it down and explain these mistakes I make
I like to tangle up the strings of the puppetry
But you knew me back when I was a younger me
You've seen Sean in all types of life
And I've been meaning to ask you if I'm doing alright

Yesterday, was that you
Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy cause I miss you

Yesterday, was that you
Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy cause I miss you

I'm shook
I know
I pushed when I should of pulled
Took it all back if I could I put that on my soul
And I would make a top notch good listener
If you could block off a little time out to give it here
Since we went our separate paths
I hits a couple of snags
That remind me of the past
I cant front I'm having a blast
But damned if I ain't afraid of how long its gonna last
Sitting here wishing we could kick it
Gimme your opinions I do miss the criticisms
I didn't mean to be distant
Make a visit
Ill wait up and keep the coffee brewing in the kitchen
But who am I jokin' with
There's no way that you and I will ever get to re-open it",Yesterday
Atmosphere,"[Chorus]
You love the people that love you.
You hear the music they move to.
You give your ode to the fall through.
But you don't know you don't know you don't know you don't know.
You love the people that love you.
You hear the music they move to.
You give your ode to the fall through.
But you don't know you don't know you don't know you don't know you.

You just got off work, huh?
Another night feeling like the worst one.
You didn't even count your tips yet,
But you can tell that it ain't no big step.
I don't see why you so nice to customers
They're all fucks and low lives.
But don't fight, just keep the lip stiff
And get that money it's the weekend shift.
But why they all gotta be freaks.
Wish they would just eat and leave.
And keep they eyes to they-selves, already insecure, don't need any help.
But you can blame the pride that makes you hold your anger inside,
But deep down you wanna curse them all.
Fuck off asshole jerk off dirt ball.

[Chorus]

Now attitude check,
Still show up? You haven't quit yet?
And even when your meat gets sweet
They still treat you like a piece of meat. Huh.
Outrageous, each day this clock tick tock and you still a waitress.
Trying to pay them student loans
And the lights and the phone and the food and the home.
And you ain't quite broke but you couldn't afford that place on your own.
Gotta roommate, to split the rent with
Now you never feel independent.
And everything seems so hallow
Cause after work, where'd that smile go?
Better bring it back tomorrow.
Now, pick up the pace and you might make bar close.
Perfect, last call then some.
Flirtin', sexual tension.
Surfin', through them men
Cause they all searching for that bent one.
But just one to bend, and you look like you could be my friend.
With a smile like that, I gotta flirt.
Girl, you just look like you got off work.
Huh... huh... huh...

[Chorus]",You
Atmosphere,"Everything used to be so good then
Now it seems like you're mad at my footprints
I'm only trying to scribble in the book, man
It's not my fault that y'all couldn't
You must have a lot of free time
Otherwise why are you trying to see mine
Strain your neck, let the blame project
But don't give yourself the same respect
So independent but undependable
We're all getting old, now take a mental note
And stop being so covetous
The crime is the punishment
Now run and get a slither of dignity
You ain't gotta be a figure of misery
You don't want to be a victim to victory
Listening to a bitter sweet symphony

You're so bitter
You're cold as a river in the winter
This one is to recognize you
Your jealousy needs an anthem too
You're so bitter
You're cold as a river in the winter
This one is to recognize you
And all of these dreams that can't come true

We used to get up in Uptown
Then we hit the highway to run around
Came home everybody wanna judge now
Don't let them see you celebrate your touchdown
Keep clutching those grudges
Don't budge if no budget
The old puppets show love in public
But behind the back can't trust it
Disgusted, repugnant
Insulted, repulsive
Discouraged, rejection
No protection from your own reflection
Chip on your shoulder big as a boulder
Insecurities a slippery slope
Got ya looking around for the sympathy vote
Anything to give a little glimmer of hope

You're so bitter
You're cold as a river in the winter
This one is to recognize you
Your jealousy needs an anthem too
You're so bitter
You're cold as a river in the winter
This one is to recognize you
And all of these dreams that can't come true

Treat love like a limited resource
Fight for it like there's never gonna be more
On the rooftops talk to the spaceships
Like you've got 2Pac locked in the basement
Get the bag, make the get away exit
You get mad like your middle name desperate
No net, better not get left back
Yeah, you should probably protect that
I'm trying to keep it simple, teeth to the nipple
Beat my chisel, leave my initials
Fly so far when you follow the signals
Sky full of stars and all of them wishful
Not only are we bitter but we're brittle
The world's getting small, and everybody's little
Go roll your eyeballs, toot your own whistle
Don't ever stop waiting for the window

You're so bitter
You're cold as a river in the winter
This one is to recognize you
Your jealousy needs an anthem too
You're so bitter
You're cold as a river in the winter
This one is to recognize you
And all of these dreams that can't come true

Atmosphere,"It doesn't matter who you are
You're just another superstar
Everybody gets to shine at the hotel bar
With the fireflies that fell in the jar
Ain't even trying to get free
Buzzin' around is fine with me
That's why I keep one eye on the clock
The other eye on my drink
Make it link like a lock, the timing is key
Got my hands tied up still climbing this tree
So can't none judge what my crisis might be
Everything will even out when I finally sleep
Tipsy dreaming about being a pirate at sea
Huh, I hear the sirens singing for someone else to listen
Got me thinking I avoided a bullet
But a lot of my vision was under blurry conditions
I watched from the top of a volcano of bullshit
Which came first, the thirst or the curse?
Most can't distinguish which one is worse
Bartender in the tuxedo shirt, with the sleeves rolled up
'Cause she's seen enough dirt, whatever
Look, I don't know if the ocean is close but
I'mma keep going 'til I no longer float
Aight, so quit trying to micromanage my emotions
Keep the glass half full or keep the tab open
Last call for alcohol protocol
The television that's attached to the wall
It show a basketball game with the volume off
And I don't know who's playing but I know I'm not
It goes

I feel like a firefly
I chase all the fireflies
I feel like a firefly
I chase all the fireflies

It doesn't matter what you think
Either way it's all relative
The buzzing from the neon lights
Is like a sedative, I follow it
Into outer space like an Apollo ship
Coasting off the bottom shelf booze and the kolonopin
I'm lost, wrote my room number on the fob
Put a dollar in the jukebox, ordered up a shot
Now everything is frozen just floating flickering dots
As we fade into the night without ever giving it thought
But that's the idea, we don't come for the atmosphere
The food's shitty, the cable's blurred but I'm happy here
We're all alone but ain't nobody keeping tabs there
'Cause misery's a meal that's served better with a glass of beer
Yeah, so fill it up and let me sulk
Smelling like whiskey and complimentary soap
It's the same four bars in every city I go
Surrounded by fireflies just trying to find their glow

Atmosphere,"Let’s make a bonfire
I got a blanket in my trunk
One blanket, and we can wrap it around both of us
The lake is beautiful this time of night
I wanna listen to your breath while I look at the moon
Plus, plus I got you this solo priced ice latte, look at the stars
Check this out

There’s far too many breakup songs
And there’s not enough songs about the moment we met
A lot of words get spread to paint shame and regret
And I’m not holding my breath for any change to the sketch
But I hope to death, somebody came to sing about
Countless times that we found a way to even out
Even though we were born to work with these hands
It’s in the plan for us to learn the Insecurity Dance
It goes:
Make a party as a method do prevent it
I’m so sorry you reacted so defensive
If I could land in unsolicited suggestion
Don’t even know if I’d recommend that you paid attention
They told me Hell never felt so good
But I can tell that they’re only trying to sell some books
Look, y’all know that I would help if I could
But I was too busy tryina nail myself to some wood
There’s more songs praising the people we went to prison with
Then there are praising the people we make children with
And I ain’t saying either one is more legitimate
But it’d be ridiculous to think that it’s coincidence
Shit, I’ll never be the best at this
I write songs that I’m living in, welcome to my sweatshirt
I think it’s magnificent that you’re presently present
Thank for listening, appreciate your effort
Cinderella, fit your hand in the glove
We’re on a spaceship crash land from above
We’re on a lazy river fly fishing for love
We’re on a double barrel shotgun hunting for dove
Life is just a song; I hope that it’s wrong?
It starts with hello and it goes till I die
If I did know it all, I’d at least attempt to clarify
Why we’re tryina over emphasize the goodbyes?
We’re tryina over emphasize the goodbyes
We always emphasize the goodbyes

The way you're treating me, it's mean

The moment you're gone
I don't think that I

Just as soon as you're ready to,

And small promises you couldn't keep

But my tears they just cut so deep
And I can't get myself over you

So strong and so secure
But all that's left is memories 
The feelings are no more

All dried and blown away
The letters and the pictures 
Are all that will remain

But every moment 
Of every day
I want to see you
I want to say

No one loves you like I love you 
No one needs you the way I do
No one knows you like I know you 
No one hears you the way I do

So many years of memories
Suppressed beyond recall
The feelings once so broken
Seem silent and so small

But every moment 
Of every day
I want to see you 
I want to say

No one loves you like I love you 
No one needs you the way I do
No one knows you like I know you
No one hears you the way I do

Was my love just a bit of fun?

Should've said that you were leaving
I would just have cried
No you walked away, without explaining

Then I ask myself 
Can this be wrong

Can't control

Oh my head 
Is spinning round
Can't believe

I wish I knew what's 
Going on in my mind

I used to run
I used to hide
From love
But now I'm satisfied

Cause you showed me
That love could be
So good
So real

So many things 
I used to let get in my way
Now I open up my arms and say

Hey, loving you
All I want to do
For the rest of my life
This feels so right
I'm loving you
All I want to do
For the rest of my days

I'm loving you

An open book
An open door
That's what you are
And I thank you for

The heart you give
That's sensitive
You're all I needed, 
You're so much more

I used to fill each hour 
Of each single day
Now I slow it down enough to say

I'm loving you
All I want to do

This feels so right
I'm loving you
It's all I want to do
For the rest of my days

It's too late to pass through I really should
Well, I'm captured by a cliche?
But I can't find no door

And I've blamed my sweet little mum ""I ain't no fortunate son""
For so long I've chewed these words with no chance to use 'em
For so long I've really thought I was the only one
So if I'm not
Let us share all these drunken hours
And let us fly
From the roof of this tower

Push past the point of raw emotion I will breathe
Exist with a broken spirit I will die complete
Ignore what the angels say enjoy that special place where the demons speak to me
I won't pick out the lining of my coffin yet unless I am sure that color satin is me
Better yet go with crushed velvet, that way I'll be damn sure to enjoy eternity
My daily life writes the eulogy, engraved on tombstone diaries
laid to rest with the passing of time
Seems to me that even love can die
And the rituals, that fade away, and the roses that cease to be laid
And to me it clearly appears that we're already one foot in a very shallow grave

Oh I'm drowning and I feel so alone
The lights are on and I wish I was home
My lips are screaming pretty nothings
My ears are bleeding for want of words, fuck words I need actions
Hope as left me fucking shattered
Someone's standing on my chest
Alone would be a pleasant change from here
How do you gauge loneliness how you ever felt so alone

In the back of your head
It's even harder to speak when everything you say

Gutted like a pig, all you want is the world to bleed
Someone somewhere stole your desire
The pain akin', to being punched in the throat
And stabbed in the chest

You would rather bleed than be without her
Gone are the tender whispers dancing in your ears
Replaced with lackluster memories you cry
Your screams play in your empty room

It's so hard to see when your eyes are rolling
In the back of your head
It's even harder to speak when everything you say
Just comes out wrong

Your bed swallows you whole as the days bleed together
Torment on the lips of a loved one
And if you try hard enough, you can almost taste her
Feel her pass and scream, oh God why me

You would rather bleed than be without her
Gone are the tender whispers dancing in your ears
Replaced with lackluster memories you cry
Your screams play in your empty room

It's so hard to see when your eyes are rolling
In the back of your head
It's even harder to speak when everything you say
Just comes out wrong

Atreyu,"Lift up a stone and you will find him,
Cherish the beauty in the world around us 
Not in buildings or crosses made by man 
Judge me, fuck you, stop playing god, 
Your forked tongue prophecies,
Carelessly caressing the wounds of the weak 
People like you should be crucified,
Then maybe just maybe you would have an idea 
Of what you are talking about. 
My only solace is that one day,
Judgment will come for the wicked, then we will see who burns 
Raise your heads, unclasp your hands,
Your weakness makes me tremble 
True strength comes from within 
And we were given this life to live,
Not exist under standards, set by some bullshit rule book 
What prayers of yours, were ever answered, by degrading others 
Spare me your biblical back peddling nonsense 
For the people that you've hurt, and the being your dishonor, 
Your fall from grace, will finally justify my means 
Judge me and now you are me and what's worse 
You are now a traitor to your god 
Tell me Judas, how does it feel to be looked down upon 
Sinners like you, should be stung up from the highest tree 
You judged me and now you are me, stop playing god",At Least I Know I'm a Sinner
Atreyu,"Coward, the next time you want to fuck me over stab me in the front 
Can I still see my future in your eyes,
Or can I picture myself dead in your embrace 
And your cruel crimson red smile, kills 
Everyone cared about you. Why couldn't you 
Instead your greed compelled you to steal other silver linings. 
No one could have their moments free from your withering touch. 
Fuck off like you're the only person that has ever cried or been broken by love 
Spare me your pity party drunk off your own misfortunes 
Wallowing in your blissful melancholy 
Can you taste my blood. You knew that this would kill me. But you carried on and on 
With your selfish shit, everyone cared about you. Why couldn't you 
Instead your greed compelled you to steal other silver linings. 
Burnt down my world, you killed my hope 
Spread out the ash and walked away 
How could you just close off your eyes.
Turn tail and run, you are the greatest coward 
Damn right I am still pissed.
Next time I see you we will see who has the upper hand 
Kiss me fist. Taste the floor. Tired of your games. fuck off goodbye",Deanne the Arsonist
Atreyu,"Yesterday I forgot to breathe for like the 6th time this week. 
Maybe it was the pink cloud strafed sky that changed my mind and brought me back 
Seems like every day it's kill or be killed.
With all this anger there is no time to inhale and progress
And catch the smell of something that you once knew. 
Have you ever stopped raised your face up to the sun and screamed 
Let it out exhale the pain 
That strangulates your soul, when will I be free 
My lungs take in the fragrance of remorse, what is the cost, am I living, 
If you let your lungs fill up with pain then you will drown in your own regret. 
My arms feel so numb my heart palpitates missing a beat. 
The blood freezing in my veins. the taste of rust in my mouth. 
But today I just threw it all away 
Though the light burns my eyes I will not be blind, 
If you blink you could miss so much. please don't ever close your eyes",Dilated
Atreyu,"If I gave you pretty enough words.
Could you pain a picture of us that works.
An emphasis on function rather than design.
Aren't you tired cause I will carry you, on a broken back 
And blown out knees, I have been where you are for a while 
Aren't you tired of being weak?
Such rage that you could scream. the stars right out of the sky 
And destroy the prettiest starry night. every evening that I die.
I am exhumed just a little less human and a lot more bitter and cold. 
I am exhumed just a little less human and a lot more bitter and cold.
I am exhumed just a little less human and a lot more bitter and cold.
I am exhumed just a little less human
So much more bitter and cold
After all these images of pain, have cut right through you,
I will kiss every scar, and weep you are not alone
Then I'll show you that place in my chest where my heart still tries to beat. 
Aren't you tired of being weak?
Such rage that you could scream. the stars right out of the sky 
And destroy the prettiest starry night. every evening that I die

I understand now what I-love-you means -
It's doing the right thing no matter of the consequence

I'm tying you up, using the nicest lace
Trying to kill you softly, trying to erase your face

All the while I'm doing my best
Not to rub my love against your head
I'd redecorate the walls with your inner thoughts
But I'm afraid it's the wrong shade of red

Fresh meat for carnal desires
To become what I became
I viewed the sun for the last time

Will you still hold me when you see what I have done?
Will you still kiss me the same when you taste my victim's blood?
So crimson and red, I feel it flowing from your lips

My heart is dead and so are you
And it pulses through, the desire to change
The desire to deconstruct all of my past failings
But where to begin because when you live in sin
It's hard to look at saints without them
Reflecting their jet black auras back on you
And all I have is hope, my inner burn's not fading
I'll wipe the blood from my cheek and get on with my day
And all I have is hope, and all I need is time
To bury in pine under six feet of time

Dancing across your face, and when the blackness veils your eyes in pain
I know what it's like when memories make you wince
And love letters read like obituaries
And photo albums are the books of the dead
I need no reminders, no more reminders
I'll forget the past and lay it to rest

If I had my way
I'd cut the calluses off your breaking heart
If I could get past the sternum

Finds its way underneath my skin

Rabid and diseased reality fades away
When I pushed myself too far

And your beauty, your strength inspires all of my days
I would carry any load just to bear your cross for a day

And if you close your eyes tight enough
Then none of the light can get in
You scream as the light hits you
And radiates upon your whole soul

Then you'll have bleed this all left

Suck me down, its time rock and roll
Lets hit the bar, lets loose control
One false move you took me home
One false move your all alone

But it looks so good and it feels so nice
I've paid my price
I'll cut you out just to hear you scream,
Get away from me
And I can feel my heart beat racin'
As I realize what I must do
Get away from you

should've turned around like you
Last time I got a taste of you
I should've turned around like you
And I say we're through

You have haunt me like a plague
Weakness, we've worked at
But I digress

The same fork in the road
I hate you. You love me. 
This story's getting old

The day I opened up 
You shut me out for good
Forgive, Forget, Fuck you
You are a liar and a whore

So take what you want and leave
You'll never get another part of me

I remember the day that
I thought I would be free
I poured out my soul to you, 
Exposed everything, 

Next thing I know
My hearts broke 
My hand it's much the same
I did my best to drink you away

So take what you want and leave
You'll never get another part of
You are poison on man's lips 
Lured in by the curves of your hips
Come here boy, stand by me
Look my way, have another drink

I should have got up
I should have got up and left you 

And I will never ever be you're lover again

This is may not seem to subtle to you
The point I'm trying to make is we are completely through

Do you still taste her
Are you thinking of are you thinking of me
With your lips pressed tightly up against his skin
Does your body still scream my name x2

Hold your breath to keep in
Trapped with secrets
Til you die to come through with guilt
So your blood is filled
When I see the blood worth coming
Would I check out the blood
Even if I was dead
You would never be on the fucking top

Are you a killer and I think I know its you

So hurry up to figure you out to insult'

One time from your good times
I'm not interested in working this out

Fuck off to be without you

Not even not even kick you when your down
Though you wanted something because you
Are living the lonely star
But this is the part where I say goodbye!
(And let the scent of time)
Pull over us say goodbye!
And let the sands of time flow over us

You never had to crawl
You never had to say what it feels like
To be so trapped underneath

I was longing to be free i've left a burden in you and me

And they pull at my guts
What do I have to do to end it
The better days hacked away
Leaving me only pain
This regret is never ending
But in the blink of an eye
This life passes you by
I wish that I could give you my time

With only blood, sweat, and tears to adhere to

Open your eyes and see,
That it's so menacing,
You need to realize that bleeding is a luxury.
Give 'til there's nothing left,
Value in every breath,
You need to realize that bleeding is a luxury.

Open your eyes and see,
That it's so menacing,
You need to realize that bleeding is a luxury.
Give 'til there's nothing left,

Atreyu,"Don't give a shit about it
Curl up, I start to doubt this
Something has died in me today

(Smell the decay)
I need some air around me
Claw walls until my nails bleed
Don't seal my coffin shut today

Coffin nails
So hard to pull
How can I break free?!

From the ties that hold you down

(Break free)
From the grips of loneliness

(Break free)
There's something missing in my life that I'm running after

(Break free)
Never meant to be held down

(Break free)
All I need is home right now

(Break free)
Is there something missing in my life that I'm running after?

Self doubt breaks down my resolve
It cripples part of my soul
And masterfully I'll hide my pain

(Smell the decay)
Dead eyes and a hollow smile
Pitch black, my vision is gone
And masterfully I'll hide my pain.

Coffin nails
So hard to pull
How can I break free?!

The joke that the pentagons became
To win a war is the last thing on their mind

Shattered dreams
All because of me

Blinded by the white
You can't see the light
Not tonight
Life of pain and I'm to blame

I've got you hooked
Take another look
At yourself
Lost your home and pride
You can't win the fight
You're not too bright
Life of pain and I'm to blame

Trained for battle, prepared to die, you don't give a damn.

Killing women and children and everyting around

Never feel at ease until you're laid to rest
Sargeant tells you and you carry out his every command.
No return from this life you're on the 4 year plan.

The beast aroused, begins to prowl
Aware of every smell
He notes perfume in the air
Sees footprints in the dust
Woman's blood upon the ground
A victim of his lust

[Chorus:]
He can't resist their call
His night will be their last
Sworn to have them all
A product of the past
Beaten at an early age
A scared and confused child
Fierce revenge on womanhood
Makes mother's wrath seem mild
Every night tortured sleep
No one there to care
Outcast of society
Trapped inside his lair

Yet you gave and gave
Now you're trapped
Ambitions shattered
Another mindless slave

[Chorus:]
You never asked for anything
And that's exactly what you got
They never cared for you
They're glad to see you rot
Nothing's really yours
It's only mortgages and leases
When you die
Then you rest in pieces
Line their pockets with your labor
You go home in debt
Your children die from malnutrition
Your bosses never wept
They justify the life you lead
A life that's full of pain
You were born to serve your master
Your caste revealed by name

[Repeat chorus]

[Solo: Rick]

Sick of their oppression
You come to take what's your
Rip their hearts from their body's
Their blood pools on the floor
A smile plays across your lips
Their life breath slowly ceases
Leave their mansion a free man
As they rest in pieces

",Rest in Pieces
Atrophy,"[Music: Atrophy]
[Lyrics: Chris Lykins]

[Solo: Chris]

Throughout our troubled history
Man's exploited fellow man.
Displaying xenophobic fear that's hard to understand
Centuries ago in Europe things were different than today
Foreigners were treated with respect not disdain
But dreams of power soon crushed this fine ideal
They set across the ocean in search of land to steal
They subjugated natives and stripped them of their rights
Sold them into slavery to demonstrate their might.

Socialized hate
Formed by modern state

[Chorus:]
Can't you see, it's a lie
Don't you know, that they've died
Trapped, by your hate
Stereotyped, convenient
Forced to be subservient
Taught by your state
All you pseudo-christians had yet to have your fun
You called them all subhuman
Justifying what you'd done
You sold them into slavery, every last one that you could
I guess that's only natural when you say its in their blood
Soon the racist theory spread to every colony

The crimes that you committed were for everyone to see
Depleted all their hunting grounds and chopped down hallowed woods
Set your plantations on the land
Where they once stood

[Chorus:]
Socialized hate
Formed by modern state

[Solo: Rick]

The hatred that you planted is still with us today
No longer simply slavery manifests in different ways
Keeps people in dead end jobs, reduces education
Maintain our racial sterotypes, encourages segregation
You propagate injustice saying they've done it to themselves
You lock them in your ghettos,
Deny them any wealth
The dogma you've created makes sure you never see
That underneath a different color
They're just like you and me
Socialized hate
Formed by modern state




",Socialized Hate [Multimedia Track]
Atrophy,"[Music and lyrics: Chris Lykins]

Man builds his world, forms it from rock, steel and clay
His view of nature is that it stands in the way
Visions of profit dance in every landlords head
13 in two rooms, four in every bed

[Chorus:]
Man-made paradise
Falls into decay
Desperate humans
Trapped in their own cage
Look out the window not a free to be seen
They just block traffic, man is forced to intervene
Hiding in darkness, fearing for his life
Man's lost compassion but has replaced it with a knife

[Chorus:]

[First solo: Chris]
[Second solo: Rick]

Desperate children turn to drugs for their fun
Bodies inhabit the morgue claimed by no one
Hiding in shadows, their lives reduced to a lie
Freedom forgotten, no one hears your cry

",Urban Decay
Atrophy,"Talk about humanity, what's wrong and what is right
You take a human being and strip them of their life
A tormented soul, trapped and left to decay
In a controlled environment to die in a demented way
Death row, he's awating, time just drags by
Gas chamber awaits for him to pay for his crime
When will the madness end, will it be today
What terrible thoughts living day by day

Chorus:
The crime was committed, forever left condemned
Left and forgotten, the fortune never ends
Sentenced to death, delayed for seventeen years
Left to go insane now death's his greatest fear

15 thousand dollars monthly that we pay
To keep him alive, now that's insane
Injustice prevails again, it's the American way
No wonder we're in debt, why do we have to pay
If the death penalty exists to make these convicts pay
Kill them when convicted instead of awaiting
To wait seventeen years is totally inhumane
The crime has lost its meaning, it's ruthless to be so vain

",Forgotten But Not Gone

Chorus:
In their eyes I see a world where every man is free
In their eyes I see a better place for you and me
In their eyes I see a world where no one has to die
In their eyes I see a place where there's never need to lie

But as they grow this vision changes with every passing year
Each misconception lost with shedding of a tear
A world that once seemed safe is revealed to be so cold
In a world disfigured by simply growing old

They built a great nation with blood and sweat, to benefit all of man
A path of destruction they did not see, they did not understand
Live for the moment instead of the future, typical for all of man

Chorus:
Overpopulation will soon take its toll
The growth of mankind is simply out of control
Soon no where to turn, we run short of precious land
Take our complex problems and place them in our children's hands

Living on a dream, a final prayer, future lies unseen
Hope to make a difference in our lives, its up to you and me
Destroying ourselves day by day, can we change at all
Hope for the best and keep on fighting before we take a fall

You've decided that my life is yours to take
So now I'm trapped in a world I did not make

Let me go
Leave me be
Stop your tests
Set me free

In my cell, I'm waiting for your test
What hidden law makes you better than the rest

",Right to Die
Atrophy,"At the age of 15 your life is defined, it's measured in ounces and grams
The wisdom of ages is soon pushed away for a crystal that's purchased in drams
No time for book learning, the street is your school, it teaches a lesson that's real
You shun lit and science, that's crap for your parents, the only thing real is the deal

Chorus:
Words on a page, they're so hard to read
The will to learn, it's not in your creed
Why should I care, I reeally can't see
The teaching of man, they mean nothing to me

Sports is the answer that's what you've been told,
It's the only way you'll succeed
A ball is your teacher, replaces the textbook,
It's the only tool that you'll need
History and math are soon pushed away by the glory bestowed by a sport
The classroom's forgotten, their teachings outdated,
You live by the rules of the court

Repeat chorus
Solo: Skowron
Solo: Lykins

Although things aren't perfect, they're trying their best,
The choice is left up to you
Resist the temptation of the easy way out,
The promises made just aren't true
You've made your decision have given up trying
And now there is no turning back
Another statistic for our failing system,
Another that's slipped through the cracks

Repeat chorus



",Slipped Through the Cracks
Atrophy,"Forced to deal with decisions you never thought come true
Abandoned by the ones you've trusted, no one's there for you
Internal maelstrom of confusion, unsure of who you are
The things you used in definition didn't take you very far

Chorus:
The things I felt before I'm not sure if they're there
Words which meant so much fall on ears which just don't care
Emotions all entangled, it's time to reearrange
The seasons pass, emotions die, I'm helpless as things change

We often times define ourselves by our titles and our friends
We place our trust in fallacies which eventually will end
But just like dreams that fade away with every morning's light
We're left with only memories, no tangibles in sight

Repeat chorus
Solo: Lykins

Now I find I'm all alone and wondering what is real
Insecure of who I am, afraid of what I feel
But I'm on the path to knowledge, the darkness won't last longer
That which does not kill me, only makes me stronger

Atrophy,"Intro solo: Skowron
Solo: Lykins

Sometime at an early age a strange call beckoned you
It urged you on to selfishness and told you what to do
It taught you thr word trust was just a tool that you could use
To manipulate your target make them do what you would choose
And still the call kept haunting you as you raced toward the end
You went through life with blinders on, no chance to make a friend
The call that you had answered is the one that's known as greed
It's tempting lure of empty wealth is one few fail to heed

Chorus:
Too late to change. Too late to change.
Just like a lemming you're blind to your fate
You fail to question until it's too late
Too late to change. Too late to change.
Driven by something you don't understand
Your lack of comassion is killing our land

It made you poison once clear rivers, raze forests to the ground
So you cut your expenses at the expense of those around
You did not care your every touch brought sickness to the land
The only green you care bout is the kind that you can spend
Somehow after all this time you make it to the end
And stare into that darkest void that longs to be your friend
But something deep inside of you resists the need to quit
You realize that only emptiness resides within the pit

Repeat chorus
Solo: Skowron
Solo: Lykins

You realize the harm you've done and what could yet come true
The crimes that you've committed and what you still can do
The goals you once held dearly now seem very strange
Your new found care for mankind shows it's not too late to change



",Too Late to Change
Atrophy,"Morbid fascination instilled within our young
Raised and weaned on cold steel, the damage it has brung
Little plastic war toys always within reach
Replicas of war, what lessons do they teach

Pre-chorus:
Minimal control, that's why this land is great
Accidental death, the lesson learned too late
Escalating tensions sweeping 'cross our land
A gun beneath your pillow you fail to understand

Images of violence flicker on the screen
Taken in by young eyes unsure of what it means
Violent heritage echoed in their games
Countless shattered lives, no one learns their names

Repeat pre-chorus

Chorus:
Violent by nature (4x)

Solo: Lykins

Children raised on violence, soon no place to run
Setting fights with bullets, the nightmare's just begun
Staring out the window, your child plays with friends
Waving plastic pistols, the circle never ends

Repeat pre-chorus

At the thought of reminiscing,

I am searching
I am searching for faith, beauty and hip-hop
I am searching for all those who died between hip hop and heaven
And all souls set adrift and free from bedlam
With headstrong lyrics that rise like smoke from silver incense burners
I wonder who stole the thunder with the rasping edge
And who banged for baptisms with butterflies, serpentine roads and sunsets broken by cicadas
Have we really lost our century in an hour?
Are we devoured by blind faith in the powers that be?
Are these words as tense as drawn bow strings?
Shall we rebuild the tears like sap from rubber trees?
Answer me!
Answer me you T.S. Elliots in goose down jackets with your felt tip urban hieroglyphs, spliff smoke, and spray paint
Answer me you soliloquists with clenched fists 'round the mike
Answer me you angels in addidas
Tell me
Do M.C.'s still howl rhymes into the purple black of midnight?
Do they still fight to make arrangements with deities courting them with a jangle of gold and silver bangles on their wrist?
I need yearning voices of mangled passion
I need rehearsed create those style of faith and fashion
I'm searching for hip-hop beats, stomping feet to implore the ? ? ringing across the seagulls to muffle the sun
I'm searching for perfumed cherry blossoms and ? 
You see there will be no toast to the future in the banquet table of ?
No golden petals weaving a carpet of light
No hint of arrogance on puckered lips
No wind-swept islands and dreams of sun-lit silence
No riot of flowers and beauty magnified through outmost attention
And no free-style incantations to save the souls of man
I'm peeling off your straitjacket so you feel the sun my friend
I want wings, a feather, and booms so we can fly like birds to better lands
I'm wondering
I'm wondering how temples are now smokestacks
I'm up all night in silvery moonlight with palms of ??
Who stole my afro-pick?
Who licked my fingertips to sooth scratches from the vinyl groove?
Has anybody seen faith, beauty and hip hop?

I'm broken and I'm dying

Atticus Fault,"Spend all your time waiting
For that second chance
For a break that would make it okay
There's always one reason
To feel not good enough
And it's hard at the end of the day
I need some distraction
Oh, beautiful release
Memory seeps from my veins
Let me be empty
And weightless and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight

In the arms of an angel
Fly away from here
From this dark, cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort there

So tired of the straight line
And everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back
And the storm keeps on twisting
You keep on building the lie
That you make up for all that you lack
It don't make no difference
Escaping one last time
It's easier to believe, in this sweet madness, oh
This glorious sadness, that brings me to my knees

In the arms of an angel
Fly away from here
From this dark, cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort there

You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here

I can see all the pretty plans in their eyes
Little people reaching up from the floor
I can see them trying to pick their best disguise

Little people grabbing hold of my arms
I can see that there's a crowd in my way
Little people screaming piercing little words
Happily trying to have their little way

I don't want ever to let their filthy hands take me over
I don't want to let their little dirty hands in my mind
They can't get to me, they can't get to me
They can't get to me, I'm not on their side

Little people trying to cover up my eyes
So I can't see what they want to do to my face
Little people singing, simple little so I will sleep
Trying to get me out of their way

With the looks that I don't understand.

And you don't feel quite the same for me today.

When does it matter when everything is just chatter
I hear them talking with their mouth shut as 
if it really matters but when you think 
about it jealousy and overreacting 
I'm just livin' inside a moment you 
just shit talk and scatter (so just get on your feet and fuckin' jump)

The only one who can bring you down is yourself.
You’re your own worst enemy.

The secrets out so let it be known
rely on no one but yourself and do this shit on your own

The world can suck my dick

But you’re still trapped inside your mind
time to escape time to escape

No one holds you back you've only got yourself 
to blame and when you take over the world 
you better remember my name
This is your ticket to a greater worth

just believe in yourself you put your enemies to shame

Every time this year
This dark fog will appear
Up from the tombs it comes
To take one more life that can be near
In the middle of Transylvania
All natural life has for a long time ago gone,
It is thin and so beautiful
But also so dark and mysterious

Once again the priest is messing
May the God bless us all
The fog is here again
That will complete this funeral
From a place empty of life
Only dead trees are growing here
As it comes from a far
Only dead trees are growing here

Funeral fog. ",Funeral Fog

And that was the best of my life
That was when I was just a kid in town

Long time ago when I was I young boy

Now that I've learned how to cry
Now that I've seen everything god has shown

AU,"Life...life...
Life is a series of impossible dreams, yeah
Full of disappointment and it ain't what it seems
Everybody's pulling you a different way

You want to close your eyes and make it all go away
But what you gonna do when the rent comes do
And the dollars in your wallet are numbered few
Or your neighbor comes knocking on your front door

He wants the mower that you borrowed
The night before your garage burned down
Your boss is screaming
'Cause he walked in your office and

He found you on top of your desk asleep
But what you gonna do that's life!

Life! too much to do and too much strife
Life! your girlfriend left ya and it cuts life a knife
Life! seventy years and a nagging wife
Life! you look in the mirror and it's barney fife
(what do you mean by that? [first time])

You wrecked your buddy's car and
You cracked your head!
It wouldn't have happened if you'd looked ahead and braked
But your mind was racing

'Cause you was thinkin
'Bout chasing that girl who turned you down
Everybody's talking 'bout it
All over town

But then things just get worse
You look in the mirror and you think it's a curse
Your hair is falling out on your pillow and all through the house
But what you gonna do that's life!

Life is a dirty trick
If you listen to the devil's lies
But life is another man's treasure
If he's given it up to christ

Now wait a minute buddy
My story ain't done
God said it all when he gave the world his only son
To die on the cross
Just when you think that all is lost
There's hope for all mankind
Just give it to him
And you can't find life more abundantly
And that's the only reason for life!

When the coffee gets colder you can just hold me tight

Something special, something we don't do all the time
Something special, 'cause I am yours and you are mine

A little celebration, just because we can
Walking by your side with my hand in your hand
Make a little history, make the kind of memories that last
Stop and smell the roses
you know they go so fast

Something special, something we don't do all the time",Something Special
Auburn,"You walked in to the room
I just had to laugh
The face you wore was cool
You were a photograph
When it's all too late
It's all too late
I did not have the time
I did not have the nerve
To ask you how you feel
Is this what you deserve
When it's all too late
It's all too late
Change
You can change
And something on your mind
Became a point of view
You lost your honesty
I lost the life in you
When it's all too late
It's all too late
We walk and talk in time
I walk and talk in two
Where does the end of me
Become the start of you
When it's all too late
It's all too late
What has happened to
The friend that I once knew
Has he gone away

Auburn,"This goes out to my home-girls, this goes out to my homies. 

Baby girl I know that you've been off track. 
You feel like taking one step forwards, you're taking two back. 
No how matter how hard you try things always go bad. 
The thought of a better life, you'll never know that. 
You smile on the out but inside you hurt,
You say that you're fine,but you feel unsure. 
Try to replace the pain by saying false words. 
You see that girl in the mirror but don't know her. 

But the tears can't wash away,
All the fears you haven't faced. 
Baby girl don't lose your faith cause' the storm don't last always. 

[Chorus]
This goes out to my home-girls. 
Know it's hard to make it in this world. 
I know you try and it feels like nothing goes right. 
But it will be alright. 
This one goes out to my homies trying to survive out in these streets. 
I know it's tough, forced to grow up, life isn't as rough, now keep your head up. 

Baby boy the streets is all that you. 
You dream of a higher place instead you stay low. 
You go home at night and your all alone. 
Wanna call out to your boys but their all gone. 
You tell yourself that you don't need no one else. 
But if only. 
You will try, won't get lonely, won't have to hide what your feeling. 

But the tears can't wash away,
All the fears you haven't faced. 
Baby boy don't lose your faith cause' the storm don't last always. 

[Chorus]

This one goes out to my homies trying to survive out in these streets. 
I know it's tough, forced to grow up, life isn't as rough, now keep your head up. 
This goes out to my home-girls. 
Know it's hard to make it in this world. 
I know you try and it feels like nothing goes right. 
But it will be alright. 

Baby girl keep your head up. 
Promise you'll never give up. 
Baby boy keep your head up. 
Promise you'll never give up.

Wit' out ya blowin' up my phone
Why you all in my ear
Like where am I and when am I coming home
Why you listening to your friends?
They don't wanna see us be.

Boy you better take it slow
Or I'll be history
You've got to give me my space
So quick to calling my name
Boy you better recognize
My love is one of a kind
You drive me up to the ceiling
Boy there's no need for the screaming
You know that you are my world
But I'm sick and tired of the

Put my foot through the door

You can be the butterflies I feel in my belly
You can be the captain
And I can be your first mate
You can be the chills that I feel on our first date
You can be the hero
And I can be your sidekick
You can be the tear That I cry if we ever split
You can be the rain from the cloud when it's stormin'
Or u can be the sun when it shines in the mornin'

Don't know if I could ever be without you
'Cause boy you complete me
And in time I know that we'll both see That we're all we need
'Cause you're the apple to my pie
You're the straw to my berry
You're the smoke to my high
And you're the one I wanna marry

'Cause you're the one for me (for me)
And I'm the one for you (for you)
You take the both of us (of us)
And we're the perfect two

You can be the prince and I can be your princess
You can be the sweet tooth I can be the dentist
You can be the shoes and I can be the laces
You can be the heart that I spill on the pages
You can be the vodka and I can be the chaser
You can be the pencil and I can be the paper
You can be as cold as the winter weather
But I don't care as long as were together

Toi qui t’attarde au vent
Toi qui attends ton tour
Comme on jouerai sa chance
Mais qu’est-ce qu’on attend
Pour changer nos jours
Après tout on s’en fou
Aller vient on fou l’camp
On tire un trait sur 

Les issues qu’on recherche
Mais qui n’existent pas
Les beaux jours que l’on guette
Accoudés au comptoir
Si seulement on pouvait tout quitter pour savoir
Je manque d’air, je manque d’air
Je préfère l’aller sans retour
Que l’on s’en aille sans demi tout
La vie nous offre à ses détours
Je t’en prie ne tardons plus
Je préfère l’aller sans retour
Que l’on s’en aille sans demi-tour
Avec le temps on oublie tout
Même tout ce qui était foutu

On se laissera guidé
A travers les voyages

Toi la reine au grand charme
Au travers de la brume
