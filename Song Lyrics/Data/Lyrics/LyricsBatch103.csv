Extremoduro,"* ""Sucede que me canso de ser hombre""* Sucede que me canso de mi piel why de mi cara 
why sucede que se me ha alegrado el día ¡coño! 
al ver al sol secándose, en tu ventana: tus bragas
Empiezo a solas, sigo por ti why no comprendo nada,
desato tormentas sin rechistar, 
sácame algún día del corral, necesito salir. 
Yo me quedé con su olor, ella me arrancó la piel, 
me dijo justo al final: no quiero volverte a ver. 
¡Eh, lejos de mí!
deja que corra el aire, no te quemes, va a salir el 
sol. 
¡Sol déjame en paz! 
La luna me ilumina, en esta ruina entra la 
claridad. 
¿Quién quiere saber? 
si estoy quemado o escondo un corazón helado why 
quema mi ser. 
¿Ser? No he vuelto a ser el mismo 
desde que se fué
Gillespie, Zappa, Mercury, Camarón 
why me siento mejor 
si se que tengo una estrellita pequeñita pero firme 
* Frase extraída del poema ""Walking around"" de Pablo Neruda",Sucede
Eydie Gorme,"Gee it's all fine and dandy,
Sugar Candy, I've got you!
Then I only see the sunny side,

When you're handy
It's fine and dandy,
But when you're gone what can I do?",Fine and Dandy
Eydie Gorme,"The gentleman is a dope,
A man of many faults,
A clumsy Joe
Who wouldn't know
A rumba from a waltz.

The gentleman is a dope
And not my cup of tea;
Why do I get in a dither?
He doesn't belong to me!

The gentleman isn't bright,
He doesn't know the score;
A cake will come,
He'll take a crumb

But little do they see,
Why am I beatin' my brains out?

Half as well as I.

The gentleman is a dope,
He isn't very smart;
He's just a lug

How happy he could be,
But look at me cryin' my eyes out
As if he belonged to me;
He'll never belong to me!

Eydie Gorme,"I could cry salty tears 
Where have I been all these years? 
Little wow, tell me now 
How long has this been goin' on? 

There were chills up my spine 
And some thrills I can't define 
Listen sweet, I repeat 
How long has this been goin' on? 

Oh, I feel that I could melt 
Into heaven I'm hurled 
I know how Columbus felt 
Finding another world 

Kiss me once, then once more 
What a dunce I was before 
What a break, for heaven's sake 
How long has this been goin' on? 

Let me dream that it's true 

Kiss me twice, then once more 
That makes thrice, let's make it four

Every night I dream a little dream
And of course Prince Charming is the theme

Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true,
To me it's clear
That he'll appear.

Some day he'll come along, the man I love
And he'll be big and strong,  the man I love
And when he comes my way,
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile, I'll understand
And in a little while, he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word.

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday,
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day.

From which I'll never roam, who would? would you?

Eydie Gorme,"What good is the scheming, the planning and dreaming
That comes with each new love affair
The dreams that we cherish, so often might perish
And leaves you with castles in air

When you're alone, who cares for starlit skies
When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn, there is no sunrise

What lonely hours, with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything

Eydie Gorme,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is

Maybe I am living in the past
But when I meet the right one

My first love will be the last

When I fall in love it will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love

Eydie Gorme,"It isn't by chance I happen to be a boulevardier, the toast of Paree,
For over the noise, the talk and the smoke, I'm good for a laugh, a drink or a joke,
I walk in a room, a party of all, come sit over here, somebody will call
A drink for monsieur, a drink for us all, but how many times, I sat and recall.

Are the apple trees, blossoms in the breeze that we walk among,
Lying in the hay, games we used to play, while the rounds were sung,
Only yesterday when the world was young.
Wherever I go they mention my name, and that in itself is some sort of fame,

Come by for a drink, we're having a game, wherever I go, I'm glad that I came.
The talk is quite gay, the company's fine,
There's laughter and lights and glamour and wine.
And beautiful girls and summer's been mine, but often my eyes see a different shine.

Are the apple trees, sunlit memories, where the hammock swung,
On our backs sweet lie, looking at the sky, till the stars were strung
Only last July when the world was young.",When the World Was Young

That's why I'm such a wonderful shot.

I'm number one, but my score with a feller
Is lower than a cellar, oh you can't get a man with a gun.

Yes, I shine like the morning sun,
But I lose all my luster, when with a bronco buster,
Oh you can't get a man with a gun.
With a gu-un, with a gu-un, oh you can't get a man with a gun

You'd have steak when the job was done.
But, if I shot the herder, they'd holler bloody murder

At night you hang around the hall
And eat your heart out
And cry your eyes out
And rack your brains

Should cause you such misery and pain
I thought that I would be in Heaven
But I'm only up a tree
'Cos it's just my luck to be in love in vain.

Eydie Gorme,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth make a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

Oh, it's a long long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
And you ain't got time for waiting game

When days dwindle down to a precious few
September November,
And these few golden days I'd share with you
Those golden days I share with you

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you

Why keep nursing the blues?
If you want this old world on a string
Put on your dancing shoes
Stop wasting time
Put on your dancing shoes
Watch your spirits climb

Shall we dance, or keep on moping?
Shall we dance and walk on air?
Shall we give in to despair?
Or shall we dance with never a care?

Don't you be an also-ran
You'd better dance, little lady
Dance, little man
Dance whenever you can",Shall We Dance [From The King and I]
Eydie Gorme,"The hills are alive with the sound of music
With songs they have sung for a thousand years
The hills fill my heart with the sound of music
My heart wants to sing every song it hears

My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds
that rise from the lake to the trees
My heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies
from a church on a breeze
To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls over
stones on its way
To sing through the night like a lark who is learning to pray

I go to the hills when my heart is lonely
I know I will hear what I've heard before
My heart will be blessed with the sound of music
And I'll sing once more",The Sound of Music [From The Sound of Music]
Eydie Gorme,"Kiss the day goodbye
The sweetness and the sorrow
We did what we had to do
And I can't regret what I did for love, what I did for love

Look my eyes are dry
And towards always tomorrow
It's as if we always knew
But I won't forget what I did for love, what I did for love

Gone, love is never gone
And we cary on, love's what we'll remember

Kiss the day goodbye
And point me toward tomorrow
And wish me luck, the same to you
Won't regret, can't forget what I did for love

I don't want him,
He's not worth fighting for!

Where he came from!

I don't want him,
You can have him,
I'm giving him the sack!
And he can go right back
Where he came from!

I could never make him happy,
He'd be better off with you!
I'm afraid I never loved him,
All I ever wanted to do was;

Run my fingers through his curly locks,
Mend his underwear and darn his socks;
Fetch his slippers and remove his shoes,
Wipe his glasses when he read the news;
Rub his forehead with a gentle touch,
Mornings after when he's had too much!
Kiss him gently when he cuddled near,
Give him babies, one for every year!
So you see;

I don't wan' him,
You can have him,

You can have him,
He isn't my concern!
And he can just return
Where he came from!

I would look a trifle silly,
Taking him away from you!
That was never my intention,
All I ever wanted to do was;

Close the window while he soundly slept,
Raid the icebox where the food is kept;
Cook a breakfast that would please him most,
Eggs and coffee snd some buttered toast;
Wake him gently with a breakfast tray,
after breakfast clear the things away;
Bring the papers, and when they've been read,
Spend the balance of the day in bed!
So you see;

I don't wan' him,
You can have him,
You can have him,
I don't wan' him,

There are those who'll bet love comes but once, and yet,

Lithuanians and Letts do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

The Dutch in old Amsterdam do it
Not to mention the Finns
Folks in Siam do it

Some Argentines, without means do it
People say in Boston even beans do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

Romantic sponges they say do it
Oysters down in Oyster Bay do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

Cold Cape Cod clams, 'gainst their wish, do it
Even lazy jellyfish do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

Electric eels, I might add, do it
Though it shocks 'em I know
Why ask if shad do it
Waiter, bring me shadroe

In shallow shoals, English soles do it
Goldfish in the privacy of bowls do it

It's my man. 

Cold and wet 
Tired, you bet

He's not much for looks

But I don't care!

I'll go away? 
When I know I'll come back 
On my knees some day; 
For whatever my man is 
I am his 
Forever more! 

Sometimes I say 
If I just could get away 
With my man 

He'd go straight, sure as fate, 
For it never is too late 
For a man. 

I just like to dream of a cottage by a stream 
With my man 

Where a few flowers grew and perhaps a kid or two 
Like my man. 

And then my eyes get wet 
I 'most forget 

'Til he gets hot 
And tells me not to talk 
such rot

This is a big ""Fuck You"" to anyone out there that hates us
It ain't my fault you fail to recognize what great is
If you weren't so caught up in who you dick ride
You'd see the flaws in your so called generals(?) and crawl to this side
You misinterpret the purpose of what we do
Plus you probably mad that we get our props and no one's feelin you
But don't tell me how to rip this microphone bitch
If your advice was so nice, w'on't you apply it to your own shit?
The truth is I can do what you can't
Sellin' twenty thousand units hand to hand to the true fans
On top of that, freestyle and you'll get served
On top of that, all your friends know my words
I accomplished more than you will in your whole life by the time I was eighteen
Never workin' a 9 to 5, that's the E&A theme
And it's a must we constantly keep elevatin'(?) the hustle
The music, the ethic, muscle the movements the methods
Huh, what's wrong, you still don't get it? Still feel you're so gifted
Still think your sky has no limits?
It takes a minute to get rid of the cynics
But now each piece in it's place, so you can't fuck with us

*And it's suicide to battle this UMM*

The genius supreme team is the E&A
Believe that this year we receivin' MC and DJ kingship
Perceived as the most deviously seen in the media
Remedial critics don't give us love but we don't need 'em to
It ain't your weak reviews that keep people in shrink(?) with us
They leave our shows thinkin' what these kids do is unachieveable, and they right
You never in your life could do as much as we do with just two techs and a mic
I leave kids like Raymond O'Neill pissed
Cause he knows without me ain't no way he'll make it in this record biz'
How d'you advertise some shit I want or not, mention me
Fuck you and that ugly co(?), we goin' ghetto gold this spring
And anyone that begs to differ wait until this hits ya
The illest scriptures killin' listeners with the real elixir
For these Top 40 blowjobs packagin' a hit single
Ya'll flaunt pussy so hard it gives the average kids dick tingles
But who can keep your sick(?) with cuts to clot your ego trip
Beats that hit and speech that spits, raise a fist, throw a fit
It's E&A day, 2003 until forever
Ya'll should've never let to motherfuckers like us get together
It's on..it's on..it's on..it's on

*I ain't playin' cause I'm here to reign supreme*

We're here to
Bring the people and the music and the movement all together now

We see through
Repetitive etiquette and the highly unoriginal

We're here to
Bring the people and the music and the movement all together now

They will lose
Check it out now

This is a necessary change from the grim simple and plain
Gotta exercise that brain to break the chain pain is a part of gain
No need to explain
We innovate to generate an intricately interwoven tapestry
Of musical and ethical epiphanies
The interest is minimal
I'm on my own mission to mess with an angel
to take it all the way to where the sun is
Just like a runner loving running
Around to turn it into a simple symphony
Simple sentiment adrenaline is coming back
I made it my own city, whys it gotta be a superstar
I'd rather be a galaxy
But how you see is so dependent on the medicine the rhetoric
And how at any second you think you could sit on the brink of this
World is all asleep and I have no apologies
I breathe
Keep my rhymes on what we ride on
Let bygones be bygones
The migraines don't sidetrack
My final destination nothing rivals predetermination
To exterminate the germination
Of a nation that accepts anything that's thrown in their fat face
Cause when there's nothing left
There's no more point to the rat race
We don't waste a minute of the day
Hope you can figure what I'm saying
Trying to send it all way to another stage
A creative alternator rated and greater
The crazy maniabilities take it all up in your face wait
Success ain't only based on self esteem
It takes a sense to differentiate between
what's yours and someone else's dreams
I felt the screams climbing up my cold spine
Saying now's the time to put in all the energy
To get rid of the enemy.. I said its so..

We're here to
Bring the people and the music and the movement all together now

We see through
Repetitive etiquette and the highly unoriginal

We're here to
Bring the people and the music and the movement all together now

They will lose

Sick of the same old thing

Free us and touch what we can't see
Twist that knife and watch him bleed
Lost inside its way too deep
Someone choke me
Help me breathe

Run from mistakes

Feels like I'm running in place",Now
Eyedea & Abilities,"What a beautiful world, so fragile and fertile
Pain feel the void, when boy met girl
He's a puppet to nature, one year later now
So deeply and sickly in love, it makes him hate her
The average romanticized American relationship, sinks capsize
When either side becomes a slave to it
Conditioned, dependent, afraid to be alone
He needs that feeling that he can't create, (alone?)his own(home?)
He despises the fact she has a life outside of them
It drives him crazy to think she's not insanely consumed with him
Give her the guilt trip
And maybe she'll quit livin' to stay behind these prison walls
And lose all individualism
Well this is happiness, masochistic torture, plagued by the decadent, craved for affection
The needle digs deep to push contentment through his blood stream, it drowned now hollow
The pothole of a junkie
If he could only hear her sing he wouldn't want to break her wings
But emptiness has such a warm subtle sting
She makes up for what he lacks - trapped
He can't imagine life without someone like that

[Chorus]
If we'd discover the long lost art dying
Only the lonely resent angels for flying
Twisted, living off each other's sickness, like parasites
This is paradise
If we'd discover the long lost art dying
Only the lonely resent angels for flying
Addicted, afraid to take control of my own life
This is paradise

What a beautiful world, emotionally destroyed
(Her?) became girl(?), when girl met boy
Between several breakups and plenty relapses
Routine read comfort led to serious attachment
Now every once in a while she forgets to breathe
Terrified of losing 'em, paradise is misery
Too much faith in the lifesaving knight in shining armor
Now what knight's noticing - the scar she can't hide any longer
But they were her story way before he was
It's grows hope to think that he would feel such deep cuts
At first it felt so right but after one too many fights
He turned out that hallway light and all the wonder turned to spite
So they sleep in the same bed with guns to each other's heads
Dead the romance, boiling the blood that painted roses red
Suffering from post-honeymoon's disease, leeched to his whole existence
To die if he decides to live (?)
Addicted to the way she feels when they spend time together
Detouring the now in a childish attempt to find forever
Despite the fact they hold each other heart to heart
You can't be that close to somebody without being so far afar

[Chorus]

Sigh, this is the most obscure sound I've ever heard
Those lonely giant spaces in between your every word
And maybe I'm totally crazy for holdin' on
But just cause I'm insane don't mean that I'm wrong
Now that shit gone I can't sleep at night, I barely even function right
My memories on overdrive, too hungry and too cold to cry
Miss the companionship I once took for granted
The way you helped me manage, the partnership that vanished
But I don't expect you to stay chained by the ankle
There's so much world to see, so, fly free my angel
I'm dying without you but it's teaching me to live
Heaven ain't something someone else can give it's all inside of me

There's so much world to see, what's stopping me from flying free?

Hands pressed on the walls
I've got sand filling to the neck
How much longer can I fall?

Every grain is another day
Every day becomes another waste
I'll never find my way
I'm numb to the taste

Do you remember all the days when you still knew my face
Oh God, what I'd give to, to go back to that place
Here we stand separated
You're better off alone
Can't go back to the places
I'm looking back just like a ghost
How did you slip away so far, so fast
Can I break this hourglass? Can I break this?

I've got a sickness that I can't seem to shake
And I know that you hold the cure
One choice remains

Every grain is another day
Every day becomes another waste
Maybe I'll never find my way
I'm numb to the taste

Do you remember all the days when you still knew my face
Oh God, what I'd give to, to go back to that place
Here we stand separated
You're better off alone
Can't go back to the places
I'm looking back just like a ghost
How did you slip away so far, so fast
Can I break this hourglass? Can I break this?

Please help me, me empty the hourglass
Give me more time
And I swear I'll find a way back to the body, to the body that was mine

Please help me, me empty the hourglass

Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Secret thoughts hoping they'd come true
Sometimes at night I'd feel you lying next to me baby, 
But these are things that i could never tell you, 
Can't imagine what you would do, after all your so far away from me, baby

Sometimes it feels just like a fantasy 
and i don't know what to do, 'cause it's always been 
like a dream to me to find a love so true, 
But i know it's only make believe when I'm picturing 
me and you but one day i know that 
you'll be the one that makes my dreams come true

No matter what you do i know, that you should be in love with me

There's a feeling so deep inside telling me 
we are meant to be, praying that some day 
you will come for me, for me, 
but till then I'm just day dreaming thinking 
bout the way that things could be but 
it don't matter 'cause your still so far from me, baby

Sometimes it feels just like a fantasy

And I was sitting in a bar
With all the other angels,
You were smoking a cigar
One hand on your hip
And one foot on a chair
And a golden ostrich feather
That was planted in your hair

And if I really were an angel,
I'd float over your bed
Each night a different dream of me
I'd plant inside your head
And if I were an angel,
I tell you what I'd do
I'd appear in a vision
And I'd give my wings to you

And I'd say ""come closer
Fly into the light
And please, please don't be stupid
Let me sleep tonight
And please don't be stupid
Let me sleep tonight""

I dreamt you were a Jinni
And I found you in the sand
And you were trapped inside a bottle
And I held you in my hand
And you said you'd grant me wishes
If you were ever freed
I said ""an empty head when I go to bed
Is all I ever need""

So I, of course, released you, hoping you would keep your word
And you laughed the cruellest laught that I had ever heard
And you said ""about these wishes, it's too late to decide""
But I remembered that it was my dream, so I put you back inside

I dreamt I was a pirate
Aboard a pirate ship
And for a hand I had a hook
And for a heart I had a whip
And you were trapped inside your bottle
And I kept you down below
And you begged me to release you
But I would not let you go

One night I was awoken
While we were out at sea
By a floating appartion
Glowing incadescently
And I could see you clearly
As all around was black
And you tore off both your wings, said
""Hey now you can have them back!""

And you said ""come closer

You know that..
I can't even bring myself to turn my head
So I never see you
No, but you are the one
The one that I think about everyday
Yeah you are the one
The one that I miss when I go away

That you probably can't remember my face

But I would just die to talk to you

Ezio,"We used to play on Saxon Street
Outside Gino's after school
That's where we'd meet
Wearing black boots on Latin feet
On Saxon Street

At school they'd told us
How they'd rule the world
Then they'd smother us with their flag unfurled
And I kissed my first girl
On Saxon Street

Francesca against the window
She would press her nose
She would have loved to have been with us
But they made her mind her clothes
And I'd be brave
I'd stand and watch from outside
She'd always try and make me go
But I'd never try to hide.

We used to play on Saxon Street
Outside Gino's after school
That's where we'd meet
Wearing black boots on latin feet
On Saxon Street

Some of us run businesses
And some of us are in jail
And most of us, quite frequently
Upon a cross, get nailed

And I ask myself where am I now
And if you walked beside me
Would you realize who I was
Would you recognize me
Would it be something you were feeling
Way deep down, that told you

And now I want it mine

With your expressions there as well
You know how hard it is sometimes to hide me

Though you were far I felt you near
Now there's not much left that can hurt me or affect me
My age has doubled in a year 

I don't believe in God but still find that I'm praying
You know that I believe in you
I just imagine what you would have told me
That's how I still know what to do
I'll make a child but that's not to replace you
It's to replace the child in me

will say the things you said to me

But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame

When the world is cold,

Yes you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft,
There is nothing for me but to love you,
And the way you look tonight.

With each word your tenderness grows,
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,
It touches my foolish heart.

Cause I love you

Big changes, mister, I can't wait
Big changes, No, it's never too late
Big changes, big changes comin' on

This lonely affair
Just an exercise in vanity

That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep

Is when they serve you all those fine eight beats
You'll want to spend the rest of your brights

While we dig those tunes like they should be dug

Y a d'ja une pétasse au refrain faut bien qu'on chante non?
Ça ken dans l'bloc ou dans les chiottes, y'a plus d'enchantement
Pour se sortir de la merde gros il est grand temps
Histoire de thunes, combien d'frères meurent avant trente ans

Juste pour une tonne de hassanates, j'ai mis la tête vers La Mecque
Juste pour des vues sur YouTube des jaloux voulaient m'la mettre
Juste pour per-cho cette traînée t'as t'as sorti un gros verre
On passe notre vie à faire la guerre, on trouve même plus l'temps d's'aimer
Pour balancer un 16 lourd, j'ai manqué l'Eden trop d'fois
Pour payer ses études, elle a dut faire le trottoir
Juste pour une fiche de recherche, j'ai des frères en cavale
Juste pour un manque de respect, ratata rafale
On sort du studio, on sort de coins sombres
Ce s'rait l'bouquet qu'mon meurtrier vienne et pose une rose sur ma tombe boy
Bicrave d'la came sur Bèriz, tu pourras avoir une belle vie

Les frères de rue, les mères en pleurs demandent du changement

Fababy,"La daronne m'a élevé pauvre mais moi j'la suis avec honneur
Posé avec elle à l'arrêt d'bus, à la recherche du bonheur
Femme enceinte, père courageux, préfère prendre la fuite
J'verse une larme quand j'écris la suite
Quand j'plonge dans c'thème j'suis pas dans l'inconnu
Cicatrices, césarienne, poussette, transports en commun
Le paradis c'est sous son pied, marche pas sur ses sentiments
Le thème c'est ""Femme seule"" mais y'en a tout un régiment
D'après les soldats les plus forts du monde, une mère c'est très brave
'Voulait meubler ton coeur de sentiments, mais la pièce est trop vaste
J'aimerais lui tendre la main, lui dire ""Tout est fini""
Elle pleure la nuit, elle m'le dit pas mais son coussin est trop humide

Quand j'écris c'refrain, là c'est personnel
Quand j'parle de la daronne, là ça devient personnel
J'voulais quitter son nid, mais j'peux pas voler sans elle
Quand j'rentre tard la nuit, elle trouve plus sommeil

Quand j'écris c'refrain, là c'est personnel
Quand j'parle de la daronne, là ça devient personnel
J'voulais quitter son nid, mais j'peux pas voler sans elle
Quand j'rentre tard la nuit, elle trouve plus sommeil

La nuit j'regarde le monde, j'y vois plus clair
Quand les anges nous rejoignent
J'voulais faire vivre ses rêves mais pas sans elle
Palala pala pa pa

A ceux qu'ont perdu des parents, isolés, ou sur les nerfs
Une blessure pour ton mariage, une tristesse pour les fêtes des mères
Un silence mortuaire, j'entends les veines qui s'ouvrent
On se bat plus contre la mort, est ce que la vie en vaut le coût?
Une famille qui s'déchire, moi j'suis qu'un môme
Mon fils j's'rais trop présent parce que grand-père a trop fait l'fantôme
J'brûle des photos, devenu adulte trop tôt
La poésie du divorce, dicte la moi j'te f'rais un sans faute
Des embrouilles sanglantes, la p'tite soeur en sanglot
Moi j'écris un single, mais j'finirais cinglé
À cause de c'thème, certains sont dans la tise
Le regard vitreux j'ai peur que ma famille se brise

Quand j'écris c'refrain, là c'est personnel

Capitale d'la délinquance, vol de sac ça paye plus
Le 93 c'est trop d'la balle, pour ça qu'des gars nous tirent dessus
Tu pètes un fusible recalé par l'physio
Tu baises pas avec tes sons, tes beatmakers sont encore puceaux
Retourné, ciseau, j'suis encore si chaud

Le savoir est une arme, un chien me f'ras la peau
Sniffe un rail à la gare, tu verras même des trains fantômes
Laisse passer les flingues en même temps qu'mon équipe
J'ferme les yeux sur la misère du monde, mais j'vois quand même l'Afrique
J'voulais rapper pour l'fun, un peu pour les thunes
Ma carrière s'envole, j'écris ma plus belle plume au clair de la Lune
Groupies et journalistes veulent toujours qu'on s'explique
T'as du mal calibrer tes sons, j'suis touché par aucun d'tes piques
C'est bien d'avoir le volant, mais est-ce que tu connais l'chemin?
C'est bien d't'exciter en freestyle mais est-ce que t'impressionnes quelqu'un?

Nous on est chauds pour faire la guerre tant qu'y a assez d'flingues

Banlieusard à vie, j'peux pas parler d'autre chose
Trouver une meuf qui m'plaît, c'est comme chercher une vierge dans une maison close, you know?
Nous on est sur la pelouse, toi t'es sur la touche
La vérité n'sort pas des mecs, wesh, qui ont un Glock dans la bouche

Tellement j'mâche pas mes mots, j'peux vomir beaucoup d'vérité
Rester sur la scène ou sauter dans la foule, hassoul
C'est pas le rap qu'est mort, c'est moi qu'enterre la new school

Sans preuve d'amour, moi j'peux pas être coupable de t'aimer
Moi j'suis un voyou, mais est ce que toi t'es loyale?
Laisse pas tes ex refaire surface, notre couple va s'noyer (noyer)
Même si j'ai l'coeur éteint, j'veux pas d'une allumeuse moi
J'suis remplis d'vices, peut meubler l'coeur d'une michtonneuse moi

J'ai des mecs verts sur moi et même sans carte vitale

J'ferais en sorte d'être celle qui t'attends
Construire un avenir et faire des enfants

J'aime bien avoir raison, faut pas t'énerver
Si tu nages en plein doute, c'est qu'mon amour t'as submergé
Dis c'qui t'ronges, dis moi c'qui s'passe
Si l'amour nous électrocute, c'est qu'le courant passe
""Fuck L'Amour"" devant toute la foule j'l'ai dit

J'lirais entre les lignes tes blessures, pour comprendre ton histoire
Si l'amour rend aveugle, j'me crèverais les yeux juste pour te revoir

J'ferais en sorte d'être celle que tu attends
Personne n'est parfait et Dieu nous entend
J'ferais en sorte d'être celle qui t'attends
Construire un avenir et faire des enfants

Sur le chemin de l'amour les cœurs de pierre nous retardent
Plus on marche droit, et moins on s'égare
J'ai trébuché parfois mais quand je tombe je me relève
Je suivais ta voie, plus rien ne nous sépare
On m'jugera et, condamnera mais
La peine sera moins lourde que ce qu'il nous montre du doigt

J'ferai jamais confiance aux femmes, fuck l'amour c'est constant
Des coups de fouets sur mon cahier, j'suis un fils de nègre, de renois
Quand le passé refait surface bah le présent se noie

J'aime être seul j'met une distance avec mes potes
Si tu t'suicides devant l'église, le Paradis t'ouvre pas ses portes
Personne m'rackette non, l'Afrique parle d'endettement
Du sang sur mon vêtement, F.A.B est dead, non
Partir en mission vu qu'on a des armes de pointes
Paupières sous perfusion, vu qu'on pleure des larmes de sang

J'réponds pas aux clash de salope c'est pour ça qu'je me suis tu
T'veux m'faire la guerre même chez toi tu serras même pas en sécu'
Pour un rien on s'tape j'entends Fababy Whats up
Comme les algériens d'en bas moi j'règle tout au sabre
Esclave de nos désir mais parfois on souffre
Quand la mort vient te refroidir ici personne te couvre
J'ai bercé les haineux ça les arranges pas
Donc il font tourner la rumeurs comme quoi j'suis une lance-ba
Ils ont tout fait pour que j'arrête de té-chan
J'ai un casier de pyromane c'est pas pour ça que j'bé-flam
La vie d'rue me stresse
Pas d'argent pas d'mandat pour mes freres en hebs
Un gros chèque maman est en hess
Une rafale comme les pays de l'est
J'ai vécu pauvre et un peu stressé
Ma foi est au bord de l'eau et j'risque encore de pêcher
Et la bicrave au rap c'était pour payer le loyer
J'ai cotoyer des chiennes j'ai fini par aboyer
On m'demande même plus comment je vais on regarde juste mes finances
Le regret de mes proches se multiplie et moi j'encaisse en silence
Confession ou thérapie j'sais pas encore c'est quoi l'theme
Mesure après mesure je m'éloigne du rap game
Me parles pas de couple en amour j'suis limité
Quand l'huissier prend tes meubles il prend meme ta dignité
Ici bas ou d'en l'au-delas on sait très bien que tout se paie
Des gars à moi on touché l'fond avant d'finir la bouteille
J'perd des potes j'suis plus heureux d'être célèbre
Les croissants d'lunes nourissent aucun rêve
Quand les lumières s'éteignent j'suis parano et bizzare
Pour avoir l'biff de Hazard on écoute même plus Eden
Mariè à la rue j'ai engendré la poisse
J'ai beau écrire des litres l'Afrique a toujours soif
L'écriture c'est pas innée
Dit au public qu'j'ai fé-ta
Baby je sais pas où j'suis né mais je sais que je mourrais quelque part
Ah nan certain me regarde bizzarement
J'ai des frères morts violemment
Histoire de rue mise à l'amande baby
J'dure comme Snoop j'rappe comme j'souffre
J'rap dans l'trou j'rappe dans l'flou j'raconte tout
Soit personne ne m'aime soit personne me le montre
En même temps que les cadavres les remors remontent
Big up à mes sœurs et notre lit superposée
Si l'épreuve d'amour est inflammable ma mère serait sur un bûcher
Et en punchline j'ai tout fait
L'impression d'étouffer
Même si le soleil se lève certain veulent rester couché
Priez pour moi j'irai peut-être en enfer
Un délit j'irai peut-etre à Nanterre
Défendu tellement d'causes
Au mic dit tellement d'choses
Tu risques de t'faire refroidir le flingue est sous l'manteau
Décision, finition, punition
Dieu pardonne mais pas nos munitions
Ce sont des sous-sols ou des sous sales
Ouais c'est vrai j'suis beaucoup plus fort quand j'rappe tout seul
Nan nan nan j'ai toujours pas sommeil
C'est l'histoire d'une étoile qui voulait voir le soleil",Evil
Fababy,"On soigne nos blessures car nos douleurs sont récentes
J'ai fait semblant d'mourir pour voir qui m'aimait vraiment
Dites à l'imam de plus revenir maintenant
J'ai suivi mon étoile pendant qu'ils suivaient le vent
J'dois prendre le large sinon
Comme la mère de Bambi, ils m'tueront devant mes enfants
La nuit j'vois des démons
Le savoir est une arme, l'Afrique meurt devant l'enseignant

Dernier coup d'plume avant mon dernier soupir
J'me ferai tué par un noir avant d'avoir pu tout dire
Tu veux pas m'tendre la main, fais moi au moins un sourire
Aimer d'amour, le meilleur moyen d'souffrir
Avoir un air de Rythm & Blues
Leur pardonner, j'sais pas si ça va suffire
J'attends qu'un ange me trouve

Mon histoire, ma douleur
J'ris de tristesse, j'pleure ma couleur
L'Afrique a la forme d'un gun, mais elle est pas venue armée

L'histoire commence comme une dette impayée
400 ans d'esclavage et aucun jour férié

Fababy,"Journée ensoleillée, je l'ai rencontrée au mois de Mai
Elle s'baladait sur Châtelet avec un air étonné
Elle me fait des signes et puis j'm'arrête pour me garer
Elle me dit ""What's up?"", j'crois qu'elle parle en anglais
Donc j'ai pris son number, elle m'a dit ""Call me later""
Direction Google et puis j'allume mon traducteur
Elle m'envoie des ""Love you"", j'lui envoie des ""Me too""
Toujours les mêmes textos à peine sorti d'son tel-hô

Putin d'love story, vous connaissez l'endroit
Elle me teach le cainri, j'lui fais visiter l'9-3
Elle veut graille un McDo, j'lui dis qu'j'suis une re-sta
Elle m'dit ""Tu te la pètes"", you know, Baby est comme ça
Quand j'lui d'mande elle part quand, elle m'répond ""I don't know""
Elle me dit ""Where you're from?"", j'lui réponds ""Mon ghetto""
J'lui présente ma team, elle n'a jamais vu tant d'muslims
Et puis ses petits messages ont saturé ma carte SIM

Et c'est le coeur blessé qu'un matin de Juillet
Elle m'dit qu'elle a d'la peine
Qu'elle doit prendre son airplane
Quelques semaines ont passé, j'crois qu'elle m'a oublié
J'viens de la voir sur Twitter, elle répond plus en privé
I mi', I miss you (La la la la, la la la la)
I miss you
Les années ont passé, les concerts et tournées
J'ai visité le monde et je t'imagine en secret
Impossible d't'oublier, ton parfum, ton toucher
Tes caresses, tes baisers, pour moi rien n'a changé

Mais n'soit pas timide, ta mère fait que m'appeler
J'crois qu'elle sait que je passe en télé
J'sais que ma musique vaut de l'or
Et qu'Amina traîne dehors
Elle me guette dans le carré VIP
Elle danse azonto, tous sur la piste
J'sais que l'alcool bah c'est de l'eau
Et qu'elle s'amuse dans le bendo

Tous les garçons perdent la tête
Dansons solo, pas d'Ndombolo
Elle bouge sur du Koffi olo
Elle est folle et puis instable
Elle est montée sur la table
Je sais que le DJ l'aime beaucoup
Et que le videur est dans l'coups
Elle garde une place de parking
Pour la voiture de ses copines
Elle est assise au fond de la salle
Elle m'attend au Blue Crystal
Elle s'en fout des footballeurs

Oui mes punchlines sont téléphonées
Mais ta SACEM, elle t'paye ton forfait?

Quand tu viens d'en bas y'a rien d'mieux qu'le sommet
Gros bonnets, voyous, baltringues, t'inquiète on s'reconnaît
Plus The Wire qu'Breaking Bad ici, personne ne nous bluffe
Dans l'9-3 un blanc qui vend d'la coke c'est forcément un keuf
Oui Fababy c'est Fabrice, j'connais la tombe et ses supplices
Plus de doigté qu'un flûtiste, pourquoi j'ai l'air triste?
Ma musique elle parle aux jeunes chômeurs, taulards et puristes
Pas d'pe-grou, j'préfère rester seul, destin d'un pianiste
Pas d'médecin, pas d'compresse, pourtant nos cœurs agonisent
J'tire ensuite j'm'explique madame, j'fais comme la police
Tu parles on va t'sauter, tu parles pas on va t'sauter
En vrai, que tu parles ou pas j'ai grave envie d'te sauter
Un délit, tu cavales
Et toi tu suces et avale
Si Smoke et Golden t'rafalent j'peux assumer leur cavale
Même les manchots mettent leur garde parce leur vie est violente
Deux motos sur un terrain vague pour surfer sur la violence
Arrête de faire le fou, si on t'allume gros tu vas rien faire
Une arme pour la guerre, une rose pour le pardon sincère
Quand la vérité éclate, c'est là qu'les langues se délient
Quand la tristesse saute le verrou, c'est là qu'les larmes se délivrent
J'veux saccager mon passé ou pirater ma vie d'gosse
On tire en l'air tu sursautes, on tire sur toi tu suffoques
Fouiny laisse moi seul dans l'arène faut bien qu'j'leur montre que j'suis l'boss

De véritables sheitans se supplient pour qu'on t'épargne
Du bruit d'cross au coup d'crosse t'oublieras dans ta bécane
Comme une femme vierge j'ai refusé d'm'ouvrir
Quand la trap sera finie tous tes rappeurs vont mourir

Comme l'arbitre t'es sur l'terrain mais t'as aucune équipe
Les gars faut arrêter d'rager
Instragram porte plainte, mes phases sont trop imagées
Précise que c'est une loc' le gamos dans tes clips

Avec ou sans portable, j'reste une tête de réseau
Mon micro crache sur tes enceintes et tu perds les eaux
De la folie d'l'homme j'cherche encore la raison
La colère, elle est brune et d'Afrique
On t'nique ta race par principe
On nique ton pote si il insiste
Boîte de vitesse manuelle, à l'arrière l'automatique

I know that you know what it feels like
I'll always remember these times

Out on the road to no where
Maybe tonight, we'll get there
We won't turn around

So let's crank the radio up

Faber Drive,"No it's not alright,
To pretend there's nothing wrong
It's the same old fight
But it's gone on way too long
You slam the door
So I scream at you
But I'm ignored
Got me thinking what's the use?
It's true
It's too late for me and you

Now it's time, time, time
Time that we admit it
Gotta say, say, say
Say that this is finished
Tried to make it work
But we just made it worse
We took it way too fast,
We couldn't make it last
We were done, done, done
Done before we started
Now we'll both end up
Bruised and broken hearted
Tried to take it slow,
But we just lost control
We gotta face the facts
And say our last goodbye

So I'm heading home
But you probably saw me leave
When you text my phone
Saying ""Don't you still love me?""
You'll never change
Cause I can't say no
We need a break
But you're making it so tough, to give you up
You know I'll never get enough

Now it's time, time, time
Time that we admit it
Gotta say, say, say
Say that this is finished
Tried to make it work
But we just made it worse
We took it way too fast,
We couldn't make it last
We were done, done, done
Done before we started
Now we'll both end up
Bruised and broken hearted
Tried to take it slow,
But we just lost control
We gotta face the facts
And say our last goodbye

She said that love's the answer
But it's never free
I said this love's a cancer
Cause I know it's killing me

No it's not alright
To pretend there's nothing wrong
It's the same old fight
But it's gone on way too long
So we're finally moving on

Now it's time, time, time
Time that we admit it
Gotta say, say, say
Say that this is finished
Tried to make it work
But we just made it worse
Cause it was way too good to last
We were done, done, done
Done before we started
Now we'll both end up

We gotta face the facts

Porque siento en la distancia que estás cerca,
Yo no escucho aquellas lenguas que hablan sólo por hablar,
Porque veo que en tus ojos va mi huella,
Que mi vida es la frontera que no atreves a cruzar.

Déjame que nunca es tarde,
Déjame mostrarte que estoy hecho para amarte.
Déjame volar contigo
Y seamos más que amigos,
Déjame quererte como nadie en este mundo te querrá.

Si te llamo me dicen que estás durmiendo,
Que no estás en la casa o que tienes que estudiar.
Si te encuentro siempre buscas una excusa,
Que tu padre está esperando o alguna cita por llegar.

Déjame mostrarte que estoy hecho para amarte.

Fabio Concato,"Tu dove sarai, in questo istante mentre canto cosa fai? 
Stai preparandoti un caffè con gli occhi chiusi
Sarà la primavera e non ti svegli mai
Invece io che sono un grillo 
Su questo piccolo giardino sopra il mare 

Mi son svegliato così presto e mi mancavi 
E più ti penso e più vien voglia di cantare 
E canterò che mi ami così forte
Stai attento che ti sdraio 
Posso amarti fino alla morte
Invece questa è vita ed è un piacere 

Ma vieni più vicina che possa vedere 
E com'è bello anche per un ometto 
Farsi corteggiare un po'
E tu cosa farai, metti una gonna che non te la metti mai 
E proprio adesso sento che mi stai pensando 
Davanti a quello specchio so che riderai 
Come sarà quel tuo bel viso 
Quel naso così affascinante 
Quel sorriso

Lo sai una volta l'ho confuso con la neve 
In un viaggio fatto tanto tempo fa 
Vengo da te, metterò una maglia fresca 
Quel profumo che ti piace, oggi non lavoro, è festa
Sarà un po' lungo, stai così lontano
Mi godo il viaggio, sai che guido piano 
Adesso guarda dalla tua finestra, non ci credi? Sono qua",E' Festa
Fabio Concato,"Oggi vado a ritirare la mia macchina 
Ma ci credi che non ho dormito mai
Sento già quel profumino della plastica 
Ti ho aspettata tanto, tu come sarai? 
E mi batte forte il cuore mentre luccica 
E mi batte un po' di più perché è automatica 
E quest'uomo che mi dice come fare 
E non ti posso salutare
Posso fare quel che voglio nella macchina
Sopra tutto posso stare un po' con me 
E ascoltare questa musica romantica
È la stessa che piaceva tanto a te 
E mi guardo intorno è piena d'elettronica 
Ma che meraviglia quest'aerodinamica
Me la godo come un matto la mia macchina 
Me la godo senza te, ma dove posso andare? 
Ci proverò a scappare, per non vederti più
Via, via, attraversiamo il mondo
Ci metterò un secondo 
Non ti ricordo più
Ci sono due ragazzi ad un semaforo 
E si danno tanti baci che confondono 
È una specie di casetta quella macchina 
C'è molta intimità
Oggi è sabato, siamo tutti in giro in macchina 
Ma nessuno sa di certo dove andrà 
Forse è proprio questo il bello che mi affascina 
E che mi da' un po' il senso della libertà 
Posso ridere e pensare, posso piangere 
Mi dicevi ""ma che grande solitudine""
Non m'importano le tue teorie analitiche
Viaggio bene senza te ma non so dove andare
Non mi è servito a niente, stai sempre dentro me

E penso a quanti affanni abbiamo tutti i giorni 
E che fatica la serenità

C'è qualcuno che mi spinge forte 
Mi sposto e non so dove andare 
C'è di buono che siamo duemila 
E anche se frena non si può cascare 
E allora rido, dimmi cosa dovrei fare
Se vedessi questo tram cosa non è

Fabio Concato,"Era il tempo in cui cominciavo a sentire musica 
Ascoltavo un signore che aveva una voce così 
Non capivo che lingua parlasse ma mi era simpatica 
E riempiva la stanza di note e di poesia 
Tu eri lì con me che cercavi d'insegnarmela 
Mi dicevi hai le mani ancora piccole 
Ma che accordi complicati il Sud America 
Certo che a vedere te sembrava facile 
Era il tempo in cui cominciavo a sentire musica 
Insieme a te

Ti ricordi quella velina sopra il pettine 
Ci cantavo e venivano suoni un po' kasoo 
Tu suonavi Bill Evans dicendo ""quest'uomo è un fenomeno 
certamente, ma qui ce n'è un altro e sei proprio tu"" 
E stavi lì, con me a giocare con la musica 
E pensavo, la mia vita forse è questa qui 
Ma tu giurami che un giorno suonerò così
""Suoni così bene che mi vien da ridere"" 
Era il tempo in cui cominciavo ad amar la musica 
E amavo te

Adesso sono grande, è un bel lavoro fare musica 
Sempre in giro, come adesso che sto a Napoli 
Se vedessi quanto affetto non lo immagini 
È una festa e poi sentissi come cantano 
""Che sorpresa vederti arrivare 
ma un po' ti aspettavo siediti qui
Ma da quando tu sei partito non c'è più musica 
Sta tranquillo, lo so che col tempo mi passerà
Scrivo molto ma quello che scrivo e' cosi malinconico 
Come questa canzone, chissò se ti piacerà 
Dimmi dove sei 
Suoni ancora ma per gli angeli 
E ti siederanno intorno, li farai cantare 
Suona forte cosi ti potrò sentire 
Noi quaggiù col naso in su a capire cosa sia 
Sarà il tempo in cui finalmente farai il tuo concerto, anima mia""",Gigi

com'è bella la natura e com'è
bello il tuo cuore.
Che meraviglia stare sotto il sole

hai voglia di giocare,
che belli i tuoi complimenti
è strano non ho più voglia di pescare.

dev'essere quest'aria innaturale
è bello parlare d'amore
tra un fritto e un'insalata

Fábio de Melo,"Maria cheia de raça
Não teve de graça o que recebeu
Quando alguém é um rio que gera um oceano
Não há nenhum tirano que arranque o que é seu

Um ventre quando se transforma em um santuário
É revolucionário ao meu modo de ver
Ninguém vai do parto ao santo sudário
Sem saber porque

Tem que ter a luz da humildade
Cumplicidade, amor e revelia
Ninguém se torna mãe da cristandade
Sem a santa ousadia
Olhos que velaram pelo sono de Adonai
Clareai o mundo, mãe, iluminai
Cada vez que um de nós se vê tentado
Pela insana covardia

Divina mãe
Estrela luminosa que perpetuou Belém
Guerreira mãe
Nos dias de trevas nas ruas de Jerusalém
Olhai por nós
Nas horas de tristezas, nos momentos de aflição
E derramai
A poderosa força de vontade em nosso coração",Estrela Luminosa
Fábio de Melo,"Não é sobre ter todas pessoas do mundo pra si
É sobre saber que em algum lugar alguém zela por ti
É sobre cantar e poder escutar mais do que a própria voz
É sobre dançar na chuva de vida que cai sobre nós

É saber se sentir infinito
Num universo tão vasto e bonito, é saber sonhar
Então fazer valer a pena cada verso daquele poema sobre acreditar

Não é sobre chegar no topo do mundo e saber que venceu
É sobre escalar e sentir que o caminho te fortaleceu
É sobre ser abrigo e também ter morada em outros corações
E assim ter amigos contigo em todas as situações

A gente não pode ter tudo
Qual seria a graça do mundo se fosse assim?
Por isso eu prefiro sorrisos 
E os presentes que a vida trouxe para perto de mim

Não é sobre tudo que o seu dinheiro é capaz de comprar
E sim sobre cada momento, sorriso a se compartilhar
Também não é sobre correr contra o tempo pra ter sempre mais
Porque quando menos se espera a vida já ficou pra trás

Segura teu filho no colo
Sorria e abraça os teus pais enquanto estão aqui
Que a vida é trem bala, parceiro
E a gente é só passageiro prestes a partir

É um sonho meu, nada se acabou
Não é impossível não consigo viver sem você

Eu já não consigo mais viver dentro de mim
E viver assim é quase morrer
Venha me dizer sorrindo que você brincou
E que ainda é meu, só meu o seu amor

Hoje mais um dia de tristeza para mim passou
Nem o meu olhar, nada se alegrou
Sinto-me perdido no vazio que você deixou
Nada quero ser, já nem sei quem sou

So you can point your fucking fingers
And say, ""That's the bad guy.""
So, what they make you?
Good?

[Verse 2]
Bitches think all they gotta do is say the child is yours
Quit they job and live off the child support
How could you stand there, smile in court
I'm a just settle, fly back to them Cayman Isle resorts

You better sign a pre-nup
You catch me instead of 'it wasn't me'
I'm gonna say 'where you get a key from?'
I love the way your butt swishes

But non of these slut bitches
is worth me asking my doctor why my nuts itches
If they see how the Rolls Royce smell
All day I be emptying my in box and my whole voice mail

I'll be ready to light the weed and pull it
Now every chick want to make me come faster than a speeding bullet
But I ain't into coaching birds like Tony LaRussa
I done had the thickest chickens to the boniest roosters

Who have trouble getting the kid like me to spend
Ma you'll never see a bad guy like me again, for real

[Pain In Da Ass]
So say goodnight to the bad guy, come on
It's the last time you're gonna hear a bad guy ???
You better make way, it's a bad guy coming through

[Verse 3]
Come on
What type of bad guy give fellas ???, females hugs
I making my business, my kids won't have to retail drugs
I get threats over the two way from email thugs

I ride with ratchets, clips under the CL rugs
Think I'm liking you? Wrong
'Cause even if I get locked
My money won't let me stay unrighteous for wrong

Case dismissed, the DA even liking the song
Right back to the P's, latest pair of Michael's shoes on
When you holla in the club it's cool
But don't change the subject fool

And start askin if I remember you from public school
You know I done heard dozens, of these birds buzzing
Talking 'bout I used to fuck with they 3rd cousin
FYI, stay the fuck from 'round me

[unknown] guys who want to hear somebody stuck or clown me
I don't care what other haters do
But if you think I'm loved for saving you
Say goodnight to the bad guy

I'm never tweaking of haze an frequently blazing
Now if they ain't on ya face it ain't the cheeks that I stay in
Can't deny it, used to take weeks and persuasion
Now I just be looking down at these freaks in amazement
With a girl, The first thing I peep a notice
Is how full her lips is and deep her throat is
So you ain't gotta be perfect
I'll buy you whatever you want, But your heads gotta be worth it
Still what I mean is
Your brains gotta send chills through my penis
Till I feel like a genius
Look at it from a player's position
I got a scholarship, I get smart without paying tuition
My classes be like two three hours
That's why I'm the smartest young guy since Doogie Howser

Still what I mean is
I really just want to get smart until I feel like a genius
And all that I ask is
That you help me get good grades in all of my classes

Cause now I pull out, Leaving 'em looking like model for a got milk ad
I'm a teachers pet
And even if you good at math ma
You'll have trouble counting each baguette
All it takes would hood tutors and some good Buddha
And promise to buy them some of them Razor foot scooters
They don't care where the cops is
Outta the blue they stop biz
Teacher started giving me a pop quiz
I stay 10 minutes in night clubs
Pocket full of green, Duke on it invented the night bulb
I might pass on a female, And call up a substitute just for night
Class in the CL
Ya man don't know why his chicks knees be scared
Can't tell her from giving my dick CPR
If ya lift up and say ya jaws hurting, before squrting

Nark's want to see me and my team in a chair
They heard about the kid with the high beams in his ear
DEA been lookin' for proof since 9-3
When I came through in the Benz with the roof behind me
Tell them jake's through on bullet proof's and find me
You need extingwishers to go in the booth behind me
Who the fuck want to beef
My Fendi knits be [Repeat: x3] 
So you can't see what's tucked underneath
And I might not even drop
Just take my advance and make a small town in Cleveland pop
""Vivrant Thing"" on my hip, that will make you ""Breathe and Stop""
Rock ya chain in ya shirt, Your roll (Rollie) with the sleeve on top
You niggas know where my heat stay at
I leave niggas MIA and I ain't talking where the Heat play at

Niggas don't think I'm still shaving crack
Cause I pull up in a truck with a system that make the pavement crack
Baugettes have my face and beard covered
And I keep a Leathal Weapon like Mel Gibson and Dan Glover
Now I lose V Money and see Lo
And the cops think me and Muggs is G Money and Nino
I don't hit these honey's with see-Notes
Rather put them on Greyhound, Strap these honey's with kilo's
Type of gangsta every chick wants
I get Nike's from Aster you won't see hit the store for 6 months
Something bout the Beamer [Repeat: x5]
When I come through it be increasing a skeo's sex drive
Half the click look like they stuck Genisis up
The other half is tryin to wrap they sentences up
I'm never gone hate, Half these artists never slum weight
When they call NY, its the only time they touch the 7-1-8

I lay low on the other side of the globe
Carat's hanging out the side of my lobe
Pull in ya drivers side and unload

On side of the road
With ya brain on ya passenger side of ya Rove (Rover)
Y'all niggas ain't gangstas til' y'all riding
And Fed's tell ya hit a chick once and she running back like Fred Taylor
I'm snatching everything in the PJ's now

[Verse 1]
Yo, I ain't got no reason to trick or spend
Mami, I'm the reason the chicks begin cheesein' and snickering
Player like me? every season these chicks have been
Talking how I came through the P's in a sicker Benz
Heard about the platinum visas the bricker bends
Jewels so icey I need freezers to stick 'em in
I be's in the keys with a click of friends
Trees and a liquor blend, I be too queezy and sick to grin
I don't care if a skeezer is thick or thin
It's going look like she having a seizure I stick it in
Skeos say ""can I get the keys to ya six again?""
After I nut, that's when amnesia be kicking in
Most broads I done met, ain't see a guy 
Who spend a G on Gucci T's, five for sweats
I'm what chicks strive to get, I stay in the P.J's
You thinking I'm talking private jets, uh

[Chorus]
I need the cash in my palm, the ice in my charm,  ma' be easy
(Watch it, please)
Want to lean to the side while I cruise in your ride,  ma' be easy
(Put down that cheese)
Gotta have a broad wanting and let me hold something,  ma' be easy
(You get nothing from me)
You get nothing!

[Verse 2]
So the kid never stresses a female
And if you ask where I live they gon' give you
Addresses to e-mail
All that cops can suggest is that he sell
How I'm goin' push it unless it's a v-12
From S's to CL's, I request is
In the head rests his TV's dwell
They heard how many albums I presses for retail
And they can't get a dime unless it's a weed sale
And lets be real, catch me at the bar wit them crispy bills 
Getting Cris' re-fills, my wrist be chilled
And my wardrobe look like I got an Ice Berg History deal
Still dames have been giving me slow neck
And I don't even know what they real names have been
I feel ashamed to spend, cause when it comes to knocking 'em down
I'm right behind Wilt Chamberlin

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Ma you must of had too many weed totes
Cause I ain't giving you any see-notes 
I'm all about floating on them new skinny speed boats
Hundred and something with two skinny deep throats
Winter hit, I'm in a new finny ski coat
See the screens? ain't gotta use any remotes
No more shopping sprees I'm rough wit the ends
Keep honeys on their knees, scuffin' they shins
I deal wit nothing but tens
I be the club king wit diamonds shuffling your friends
Chickens get keys, scuffing the Benz
Cause they want to lock me down like I'm Puff in the pens
Snatch any chink blond who feel my link long view
(One try) I ain't trying to put clinks on you
Hope tricking ain't one of the things you think John do
Cause that's the way you end up wit a drink on you mami

[Chorus]",Ma' Be Easy
Fabolous,"It's easy to look at my life and don't see no pain
I remember takin 3, 4 trains to re cocaine
Standing in the lobby during sleet, snow, rain
Waiting for fiends with a pint of beef lomain

Breaking day on the grind, I used to be so drained
But ain't a Saturday I wasn't up to see Soul Train
Sometimes I ain't see no gain
'Cause I was runnin to Ralphies everytime my trees showed stains

I was lucky I ain't seized or maim
Get shot or stuck up standin at them see-Lo games
But now shit with these skios changed
I ain't know why the fuck they used to look at me so strange

Glanced at my neck and didn't see no chain
Be saying ""That's nasty"", wouldn't give me no brain
Ya'll surprised F-A-be	-O's sane
In my rolla life, I done jumped in and out of 3, 4 lanes
I'm still here

[Chorus]
My momma used to tell me
""Son, you're gonna make it one day, it'll happen""
Who knew I'd have what it takes,
To be famous and one day I'd be rappin - no
My papa used to ask me ""Son, are you prepared?
'Cause one day it could happen""
I dreamed about this game,
But who would of believed that one day I'd be trapped in - no

I just want some peace of mind
Nigga's will risk havin cuffs on their wrists for this masterpiece on mine
Know that I'm a squeeze until the top of my piece recline
I can't see myself in back of a Caprice confined

But on a small island, too far for police to find
With girls who look 'Rican and Guyanese combined
I gotta make sure my niece is fine
She get every doll for Christmas, new Jordans at Easter-Time

Some be like ""At least you signed""
But that just make is easy to get pointed out at precinct lines
All ya'll can see if every piece be dime
And I be gettin Nikes before they even get released sometime

Youngsters, don't let these videos geese your mind
It ain't cool to end up deceased for shine
And if you can't get the whole pot, just take a piece and grind
Hold your head, your stress will cease in time

[Chorus]

Sometimes I wish I could go way back when
I could walk through and ain't nobody know Jay Jackson
Everything was OK back then
Now everybody playin a cool role and I know they actin

I gotta go back through my ol' way packin
These wolves know my jewels is filled with O shade Jacksons
I don't care as long as my dough stay stackin
But these niggas with me be eager to show they Mack 10s

And I'm the one the PO's stay trackin
Plus I got all these ducks around the ol' way quackin
These hoes may crack grins
But I swear to God I won't never take O.J's actions

If I would've let this flow stay packed in
I'd probably be with Nick and 'Rome, spending my whole day shacked in
For now I just roll on those eight Jacksons till Clue and Duro brings those 
Gray plaques in 
Yeah

But most likely I'm with a foreign dame who name's hard to pronounce

Somebody call Silvia and tell her ship larger amounts
This playa make 'em scream a scheme
My closest look like I keep gettin traded from team to team

Look sleezy, it's difficult but me and Tim the only ones that make pimpin

Tell me how I'm gonna make my album cleaner
With bitches suckin me up like vacuum cleaners

And I ain't gon' talk about them light-browns under your shades
Bust right, thus tight
Got a thick set of thighs and struts like......uh
Yo' the game taught this brother to mack
But I think I slipped when I saw them full lips covered with Mac
You got everything that others would lack

They know I'm still spendin' show money from ""Superwoman""
They like ""where'd he get those twenties?""
And ""I didn't know that's a color that the coupe could come in, damnit man""
All I say to the heffers is ""Jesus""
Keep swallowin' my kids, mights as well have no nephews and nieces
I know you want to sip Proof

I started out, gettin' hard by the ounce
No more cash in stashes, it's cards in accounts
The way I make 'em nod to the bounce
Somebody call Silvia and tell her ship larger amounts
This playa make 'em scream a scheme
My closest look like I keep gettin' traded from team to team
Look sleezy, it's difficult but me and Tim the only ones that make pimpin
Look easy
Tell me how I'm gonna make my album cleaner
With bitches suckin' me up like vacuum cleaners

Run niggas to the island I pack most
After the gun burst quench my blood thirst

And they mark on niggas now what you gon' tell us

Fabolous,"Yea, its 'bout to get real hard for these niggas to move man
Somebody get these niggas some wheelchairs or somethin'

Goin' to war is still a scary issue
But in my hood they train to kill wit every pistol
Like a military issue
Guess you a star if you sell a million every disc two
Catch a gun case an' bounce, still they'll barely frisk you
'cause, I proved I move the retail
Make the smoothest grooves wit female
And I remove the rules on V12's
You never ain't never seen it move this smooth on Sprewell's
I'm a hustler, he's just a middle man to me
The way I pass the rock, could make Jason Kidd a fan of me
Just cop one joint, I'm a one point somethin'
Still I had you at gunpoint, with one joint dumpin'
So watch what you say to them, crackers
I'll put a couple g's on yer head, like you play for the packers
I'm rap's Labron James, I quickly see baskets
These scrubs wouldn't make it to the Mickey-D's classics
You got some sticky weed, pass it
If not put it out, I'm pushin' it before they put it out
Wit the dash, wooded out, Shaq O'Neal, footed out
Blastin' a do-did-it, first before they put it out, clue

Maybe wouldn't be a million kids wit they faces on containers
If cops pursue the same way they chase us entertainers
In the hood, a few big faces and a chain-a
Get metal in ya mouth, like braces and retainers
Even the young bucks be scheming on somebody change
Tryin' a sell somebody 'cain, before they even potty trained
You can smooth talk your way into a hottie brain
Have her suckin' long enough to leave a nigga body drained
I wasn't taught, I learned from watchin' stupid people
That'll run up shootin' in front of a group of people
I lay in a cut, the same way the troopers peep you
Ride up on yer Coupe creep you
Why you let a groupie deep you?
'cause even if you reppin' like a man of steel
You gon' still need a weapon when you land a deal
One for watch you slippin' like you steppin' on banana peels
Think a nigga ain't gon' pull a weapon 'cause you scanned a mil'?
I crept in and got handed meals

(Yeah)

I know these niggaz hoped I wouldn't make it, fuck you
Your hatred only made me wanna cake ya, fuck you
Wherever I see you nigga I'ma buck you
And put a hole in your chest that's big enough to drive a truck through

I bring the drama back where you lives, flatter your wiz
Reload and then point the Mag at your kids
So what I sound remorse, the records I still peep guns on me
But the difference now is only Deserts

If I talk it's gonna be reckless, I'm ready to die
So when I apply pressure, niggaz gon' respect it
Tote guns to rob niggaz, I told 'em to use
And leave enemies of friends that like broken and bruised

They ain't crazy, they just broke and confused, cross me
And they'll be talks of how they found the man smoked on the news
I'ma career crook they used a mug shot from my graduation picture
And my junior high school yearbook

Paul Cain never appear shook
Yeah, I might talk to my enemies but never police
You wanna converse it better be brief, you ain't gotta say much
Show me the money and the cheddar'll speak

If it ain't involvin' bread, I ain't with it
I don't need D's on me, I'm already dodgin' Feds
When the shots from the revolver spread
Duck, I don't discriminate, leave CEO's and artists dead

Make slugs a part of his head
Vanish then pop up in a SL double nickel, scarlet red
Fuck you I'm tryna get my cash right
All my niggaz flip birds and blast pipes, addicted to the fast life

Live everyday like my last night, od'in or X
When I got signed like Len Bias on draft night

I see ya faggot ass schemin', fuck you
Bitch you don't wanna swallow semen, fuck you
No you hate the way I'm street dreamin', fuck you
That's why I ridin', clappin', wit the .40 Cal screamin', fuck you

When I pulled the 5 out, I kinda expected
For the back stabbers, to be standin' behind me, wit they knives out
Then the Range, wit the fins drove in
I wasn't shocked to see my foes, dressed in friends clothin'

But I still pull through the sty, wit handguns
As big as the one, Robocop pulled from his thigh
You prolly heard about the bullets I buy and how it look like
I'm throwin' batteries, when the bullets shoot by

So what, you wear a vest, why would I care
If I aim for ya chest, that be a good idea
Nigga, it's nothing to clap ya but I'm more worried
Bout the groupie cops, who wanna put they cuffs on a rappa

That's why I'm limpin' off wit a freak and a lawyer
Who woulda got O.J. Simpson off in a week
I could show you how to blow up on ya own in a Benz
That'll hit a buck and make the windows go up on they own

Wit a stash box compartment for a handgun
That make holes the size of peep holes, on apartment doors
My closet look like department stores and you wonder why
Ya girl's comin' home, wit a cigar sip for

'Cause I just dump the light Dutch, mash the guts
You won't believe how much ass I touch
Who else struts pass the sluts, and a chain wit so much
Ash and cuts, that it hangs much pass the nuts

That's why I get followed by broads wit deeper throats
Then the people at the circus, that be swallowin' swords
Y'all hopin' that the Don fall off but my money's long enough
To keep shootin' ya bank until, ya arms fall off

I'm eatin', and I ain't have to use someone's utinsels
And when you clean as me, you know that every bum is against you
But please don't let someone convince you to test the kid
And get hit wit slugs as long, as a No. 2 Pencil, fucka

I see ya faggot ass schemin', fuck you
Bitch you don't wanna swallow semen, fuck you
No you hate the way I'm street dreamin', fuck you
That's why I ridin', clappin', wit the .40 Cal screamin', fuck you

That's right, it come with the car
Now tell your boss, you can't come in tomorrow

My dro come by the jar
They bring me drinks, why come by the bar?
Nah, nigga I ain't come here to spar
These hallow tips will come where you are

I stomp through smooth with the soldiers
Two steppin', movin' my shoulders
Now the money's rollin' in
We got bottles lined up like bowlin' pins

Mami, you standin' with a slouch
Starin' at me while I'm standin on the couch
Come and get in the blue flames
Have a sip of this blue shit and let's rock

But you lookin' good tonight
And you know I don't usually do this
But you gon' smoke tonight

And you know I don't usually do this
But you gon' drink tonight
And you know I don't usually do this
But you gon' fuck tonight

Now who's hot? Who's not?
I can take the few shots you've got
I can burn a few knots you've got
I can blow the few spots you've got

But I chill, I will
Get it to poppin' whenever I feel
I still shut it down
And I white and yellow stud it down

Watch them pretty girls strut it 'round
Take the birdies and putt it down
Like Tiger Woods did it but I'm hood with it
You've never seen a thug look as good with it

And I promise that, fuck with me
You better move where Osama's at
You see I'm in here with the white ones on
Tryin' to get fucked up 'for the lights come on, let's go

And I let em', cause I can spend em'

can't even go love another man,
I give it to em' like no other brother can,
She say my man can barely move me,

On top of that,
I'm smoother then the rest of the gangsters,
And I knew that dude you met, was a wanksta

Your girl is with the street Fab. Homie,
And she ain't fuckin with you

Can't even maintain your thangs,
And its insane the way, that she gave me brain
I pimp things the same, don't forget the name

Shorty don't try to fake it,
Just up and face it,
Your time is being wasted, your mans a basic

See it all in his face, that he's cheap and tasteless,
But life is what you make it, just watch the bracelet

I bet your man can't do it like me,
His veins don't pump pimp fluid like me,
He's nowhere near or like me,
And he probably think keeping you in check,

Is buying you a pair of Nike's 
Why wouldn't I.. get dough from her,
When the digits on my checks, look like phone numbers
Fuck It,

You might as well tell that buster skid addle,
Not even Catherine can help him in his custody battle
Yeah.

You can catch me in the club, with a case of bub
And a thick chick to rub, niggas hate because
When they sit in the truck, they be quick to fuck
When I'm getting a nut, they just lick it up

I'm in favor if, bust a flow is dangerous,
I don't aim to give shortys our relationships,
But they crave the chips, how many the range can fit

Broke niggas don't wanna stand my grind so they knock it

The hydro combined with the chocolate have ya eyes
Lookin' like the tall dude who signed with the Rockets

The flow is so sick, sooner or later
These niggas gonna need barf bags bigger than golf bags
The coke get flew on planes monthly and cops search me
For weapons harder than they do in Hussein country

And any chick that get a view of the chain wit me
I guess that's what Jay meant by chain reactions

Out of a pottable 760, inclasable very sticky
Wit a handgun, to send these cowards to Heaven quickly
I ain't pussy, so I won't allow you to ever dick me
I know these grease balls, wonder how could they ever stick me

But I move, like the President through town
Wit stones the size of earrings, in my Presidential crown
I put hollows from the Desert into clowns, 'cause the cometary
Is where most of the dudes, that are hesitant are found

So I take the time, of whatever the bench throws
The 4BM put down, in a seventy-two inch hole
Mean while getting adapted, to the fame has be hectic
But I'm fucking like I'm tryna take down Chamberlain's record

And the girls more than like you, when you running around
Doing world tours like Michael, but girl's sure don't like you
You going on like thirty-six, flowin' on some berry mix
The little money you get, you blowing on them dirty chicks

Tryna look young, so you throwing on the jersey quick
I'm on my second V-12, you going on ya thirty-six
You can look at this rider, and see I'm on the come-up
'Cause I pass the hitch-hikers, like I don't see 'em with they thumb up

I just turn the system up and keep boppin'
I never get, where I'm tryna go, if a nigga keep stoppin'
And I tell the cops, this joint is for protection
Don't they see when I come through

How these people point in my direction
That's why I poke out my jeans
Like my joint with a erection
Till I'm in a joint made for correction
And right now, the way rapper bi'ness spread
It wouldn't even surprise me
If one of these rappers is a Fed, nigga

Since I'm in the position to get rich, I'ma get it
Whether it come from rapping on blocks, flippin' and pitchin'
And fuck the stove, and the kitchen where I cook and prepare it
Nigga you know and don't try to act like the truth ain't apparent

I'm on a mission to get richer, it's as simple as that
I make it obvious, when I pick up a pencil and rap
Like a .40 Cal, spittin' on instrumentals I clap
And these verses, are like the hollow point I sent through yo back

I get you murdered if I think you a rat
'Cause if you don't show loyalty
Then that show me where ya principles at
And you don't know how much I been through, in fact

I never did like you, I ain't even gon' pretend wit you cats
And I'm the nicest, I ain't gotta say it twice and repeat it
I'm a lyrical genius, I never been beated, defeated
I'ma draw my weapon and squeeze it, you better believe it

Leave you parapaligic, I demand respect and I mean it
My Desert's the meanest, you probably dead if you seen it
Or spored out somewhere sick, you get red on the cement
And I blow off ya head for no reason and just when I'm leavin'
You don't know me ya owe me homie

I'm trying to kill two birds with one stone
It's 151's prone, that have you and hun's stoned
Trying the unknown
Doing things I know y'all parents wouldn't con-done
It's you, her and me, eyes too blurred to see
Speech too slurred to G
But you know ""Young'n"" would love ta
See ya upon each other, feeling on me while tongue and each other
Wow, it's a wonderful thing
To have a pretty female under each wing
The cake can prob'ly Pollie, both of these Bobby Darlies
That take off their Rockavalis?
My job is narly from getting slobbed on Harley's
Getting smoke from the supplier, robbin' Marley
I hope this ain't tooking wrong
But ma now I wanna see how both of y'all look in thongs

Bad bitch on my right side (okay)

Bad chick on my right lap
Do as I suggest, I confess
At my request they gon' get right
So when you see lipstick on both cheeks
That mean I slip dick in both freaks
They started calling me Two Time Johnny
After repeatedly leaving the club wit two damn mami's
This brother done had 'em
From close friends, the girls all know each other from Adam
I'm always this humble boo, hell yes!
It's cool for your girlfriend to come through too

At the most it'll take an hour together
To get these girls from dancing wit each other
In to taking showers together
They know, it's a studio in Fab crib
One of y'all can rock the mic while the other one ad libs
Boo, my government is personal
But I got enough sets of twins to make Double mint commercials
After trying X, I can only imagine what y'all be trying next
The stacks that I be splurging have girls in the back of the Excursion
Forgetting bout the fact that they was virgins
I don't care who you bringing wit you
Just let her know that I'm poking her while I'm fingering you
I love that thing that you do
And I know about the tongue and nipple
But I ain't know you had a ring in it too

You know my situation
And sometimes I know you get impatient
But you don't put to on a show to get patience
Take it to court and go through litigations
And I respect ya gangsta
Treat you like a princess
And put something on your neck to thank ya
She's my pinch hitter
When the starting lineup ain't playing right
I come off the bench wit her
It might sound like I'm gassing ya
But it took time to get from the back seat to the passenger
We been creeping and sneaking
Just to keep it from leaking
We so deep in our freaking
That we don't sleep on the weekend
Wifey
A little bit uptight
Wondering why he coming home in the middle of the night
It'll be alright if y'all bump heads it'll be a fight
But I said it'll be alright

You ain't ever step out of line
Or get out a pocket
So I made sure canary sent out your locket
To protect you, I'll get out and cock it
And you know the barrel of my gun is big enough to spit out a rocket
Oh, you gonna play dumb if cops do come through
I gotta keep the top up if my drop do come through
But I know the boutiques and the shops you run through
So I cop her one, and cop you one too
You always get a daily page, weekly ring
Plus you ain't too shy to do them freaky things
I ain't gotta put a band on your finger
I worry about you telling the whole world I'm your new Allen Springer
At first you were something I denied
Something I would slide
Just do something in the ride
But shorty
There's something that you provide
Cause the entree ain't as good without something on the side

My girl gonna kill me if she smells the scent of your perfume
Its gonna be a clip towards if I go back
With stains of your lip gloss on my throwback
She won't care if I'm a platinum rapper
If she catch me with an empty magnum wrapper
So keep it on the down low call the carsely
You seen what happened with Mr. Big and R. Kelly

You know I get from you
Anytime this chick is there for you
Feelings I'm'ma share wit you
Which makes it a Lil Mo clear for you

Fabolous,"You know what?
Everybody goes through some changes in life
Some people change for the better, some poeple change for the worse
But umm, some people need to make that change
You know what I mean? Change is good sometimes. You know?

Why would I change? I ain't never slide down a bad pole
Even though I'm certified over plat's sold
They say I'm different 'cause I ride in a plat. Rolls
But every time, we gotta ride don't this cat roll?
I never snitch, and go and hide in a rat hole
And I ain't givin' you nothing besides what this gat hold
No pride, I ain't that old
Cut off a few, but kept a few girls I decide like I'm ??
It probably don't seem like a struggle
But I used to dream that this thug'll balance beams just to smuggle
It's funny same girls that didn't seem like they'd love you
Is beggin'for your autographs ands screamin' to hug you
It's crazy, same dudes that seem like they thug you
Is prayin' on your downfall, schemin' to mug you
And people that didn't give a fuck, is dreamin' to bug you
And goin through' extreme's just to plug you, who really changed?

[Chorus:]
This game ain't change me, so don't let it change you
If you've been real with me, I'm still real with you
If you got love for me, I still got love for you
If you down for me, then I'm still down for you
If you don't fuck with me, then I don't fuck with you
If you ain't cool with me, then I ain't cool with you
If you won't ride with me, then I won't ride for you
This game ain't change me, don't let it change you

[Verse 2]
Why would I change? I didn't step out of Superman's phone booth
To remind where I'm from, I look at my own tooth
I'm speakin' the known truth
I ain't been living the same, since I moved under Silvia Rone's roof
Why would I feel like I'm a stranger?
And why should I feel like I'm in danger?
And I'm grindin' 'till I'm right
Whether it's on the streets, or online tryna climb sites
I ain't blind from the limelite,
I had my mind and my rhymes right, and signed when the time's right
People shouldn't be hateful, they should be grateful
But fuck it, I guess I gotta keep my three eight full
I'm playin, the game, like I'm, supposed
Stayin, the same, like I'm, supposed
Ghetto Fab in da house, hip hop hustler
One million customers, and I still bust at ya

[Chorus]

Why would I change when I get green like the Incredible Hulk?
I've chilled with the richest people to the ghettoest folks
Known a few ?? and met a few locs
Made a few comments, and said a few jokes
But it's gettin' me sick, someone prescribe me some medicine
Before the fame, the vibe was way better then
Some have even became rivals instead of friends
Only two become liable for settlements
I grew up watchin the
Now they hate to see a nigga drivin' the better Benz
That's why the clubs be, deprivin' to let us in
They know the family bring knives and barettas in
I'm thankful for being allowed, fans for being the crowd
How could my head be in the clouds?
It's strange, what the fame'll do
But you know what? The only one who seen the change from the fame is you

[Chorus]

I'm the same nigga man
Same nigga, that ridin' with you
Niggas that's fuckin' with you
I'm still fuckin' with you niggas
The same nigga, these hoe's ain't like
Now they on my dick right? Haha... shit is crazy

Damn, it's the wife beater wish you were in the drop top two seater
Damn, I can't blame em' if he wasn't mine shit I would try and claim him,
Cause he's so fly and I'm so fly and you'll fool
Yourself if you try to deny him

I'm nothin' like them other brothers
I got no choice but to slut her
Cause I'm in a 10-6 with the vase up that look somethin' like a nutta butta dutta dutta
Mami you'll be in saint tropez
Ridin' jet skis and mopeds
Powderin' like dope heads
Paparazzi snappin' pictures they must think you J.Lopez (Bitch)
(ha-ha) lets roast some spinach
Find a club and just post up in it
What you mean are we there yet, I got Lear jets that get to the west coast in minutes
(ha-ha) I'm smoother than white vanilla fudge
With white vanilla studs
Cause if they witnessed how I'm killin' em out here these girls just might go tell the judge (i rest my case)

[Chorus]

You could be prancin' through ghettos
In a pair of fendi's or pants and stilettos
All you gotta do is swallow some kids like that witch did in Hansel and Gretel
Who's as handsome as ghetto
This mans earrings look transparent
And my Mitchell and Ness throwbacks be so old they could be somebody's grandparents
I want the kind of money athletes consume
I have to assume
I'm no fool, but I'm so cool, when I walk in feels like there's a draft in the room
(oh) I'm so sick I drive in reverse fast
Call me a nurse fast
Shorty just lay back in the Maybach it'll make you feel like you sittin' in first class
(Relax)

[Chorus]

They ask for it
So I put TV's in the headrest and the dashboard
And you gotta catch it on tape 
Cause when the truck stops rims still look like they on fast forward
I'm sippin' liquor the color of smurf's skin
As long as the earth spins
And you'll get sea sick,
Cause my waves be thick enough for them cali dudes to surf in
(cowabunga) ya low ridin' denims
Look like midgets is hidin' in em
They say I like it from the front 
They like it from the back but when the kid is slidin' in 'm
They be screamin'
The biggest dikes be
Switchin' for dudes with figures like me
And um I'm not braggin', 
But imagine that you could even fuck with a nigga like me

Maybe cause I'm eating And these bastards fiend for my grub
I carry pumps like I serve gasoline to these scrubs
Have you seen my Aston leaning on dubs
And they can't afford chrome so they putting Vaseline on they hubs
I'm looking for a girl with a ass like Trina to rub
Take home and let her watch the plasma screen in the tub
These niggas hate I'm moving so much cash and cream in the club
And don't pass my green on my bub
But I'm a fly niggag that don't do much to pull her and dick her
Everyday I'm popping a tab and pulling a sticker
Everyday I'm switching the tags and pulling up sicker
Every ""K"" I'm loading the mags with bullets to flicker
And I ain't hesitating homie I'm pulling it quicker
So you can act tough After a few pulls on some liquor
Got em pullin on niggas
And they won't be goin nowhere for a while
They might as well pull out a snicker Ye-Ye-Yea

[Chorus:]
Forgive me father for I have sinned
But look at all this money that I spend
And look at all this jewelry that I'm in
And look at all the places that I've been
And look at all the women in those brims
Look at the blue flames that I'm in
I look at all the bullshit that there's been
And if I had another chance I'd do it again

Anywhere the kid move you know the hammers'll be with me
Poking out the shirt like a Pamela Lee titty
I went on tour brought the samples of D wit me
Came back a month later bought a Lambo for three-fifty
Think I throw you grams if you read with me
Just because you see me on the camera with P. Diddy
Dammit we P-driddy? Now I got G with me
Along with the third leg that I be rammin in these bitties
I keep the revolver you hope my gun'll jam
But with the soap its gonna blam
The info put freckles on your face like Opie Cunningham
That's why I'm watched by the Feds and scoped by Uncle Sam
Dope and hunn-ed (hundred) grams rope and hunn-ed grams
At the same time our artist get to open Summer Jam
Hope you understand or use better sense
These niggas don't want no beef they want lawsuit settlements Nigga!

I'm in a waggy with em passin by ya
With a baby girl who suck harder than Maggie on a pacifier
What I'm smokin'll have you aggie as your last supplier
When you can smell it through the bag you know that's some fire
Getting stressed by these hotties is regular
I got a magazine to press to your body like editors
Test me somebody I'm begging ya
I got the Gatling gun like Jesse The Body in Predator
I'm a hustler I don't sling no rocks to the fiends now
Got dudes who sit on corners like a boxer between rounds
Any other dude who dish rocks want beef
Cause I chop jobs bigger than Chris Rock front teef
I'm the nigga tearing the walls up in your miss in exchange for a small cup 
Of the Cris
And while you at probation filling a small cup full of piss

Or sit on chrome dipped dub deuces
And you ain't flattered by Canary envy es dipped Jesus'

Ya'll know how we do
Keepin' it Gangsta
My whole crew
Keepin' it Gangsta

Yeah, OK, uh, yeah, uh, yo
We your favorite gangstas, favorite gangstas (do better both)
Before these slugs sink hitters, weighs like anchors
We don't own clean guns (all our skets is dirty
I toss bullets, New York niggas gel like Testaverde
I don't keep the scope on the ratchet
And for the dope I'm gonna catch it)
Make sure the joint ain't point blank so they can't open your casket
My whole crew (got glocks on 'em)
In a hurry to shoot, (like they put shot clocks on 'em)
All that gossip we blast, better see if they possibly has
A V12 ambulance that will get you to a hospital fast
(We done came out the cages in shackles
I ain't call a pager to track you
I'm loadin' up gauges to whack you
We been riding together
And us back and forth), it's like puttin' Saddam Hussein and Bin Laden together
Soon as you get a crumb, they want to bury ya
That's why I travel with a semi, like Eddie in ""Coming to America""
(Silencers, it sound like it's hummin' when I'm airin' ya
Won't know you hit, 'til your body start numbin' in that area)
The kids don't want to see the toast of mom and daddy
Plus we rather be roastin' Charming fatties
In a toasted armor Caddy
(And we come through, with chains glisten and thangs spittin'
Hollow shots'll leave your brain missin'
Ghetto F A be	 (and Paul Cain nigga)
We gettin' heaps of complaints for Keepin' it Gangsta (Keepin' it Gangsta)

[Chorus]

Hey yo, we represent them down ass niggas (OK)
M.O.P. (OK), rip rounds at you clown ass niggas (All day)
B Day nigga get up off snooze [snoring noise]
Don't make me put your gangsta on the 6 o'clock news
You ride in a what (what's up), don't get it fucked up
Or twisted, cause you'll get it twisted and fucked up
And die in that truck
(be cautious when your walkin' through, be careful who you talkin' too, comes the boom)
It's the livest motherfuckers of the century
You niggas is killin' me, you got to be kiddin' me (ah ha ha)
Ain't nobody takin' it and makin' it
Extra like dust, throwin' they ass on the record and bless it like Gus
(Now) now about them weak flows, keep those, we eat those
As far as meat goes, we keep those, the street knows
The Mo (Mo) P is what's up
We in the cut, Brownsville is heatin' it up (Come on)

Yo your ego, why still spit lines that your bitch
Play see low, and spit four five's at your six
Y'all don't really want to lose your life
So I'm gonna smack flames out ya, pick ya money up and roof ya dice
Yo, you done know were we from (From) soldier, come (Come) soldier
Jump (Jump) soldier, you been found and your whip's slumped over
With your gangsta ass, dead and your gone
Iced out, chain out, with ya brains out, head on your horn 
You (You) know (Know), who (Who) be Keepin' it Gangsta
With a truck full of goons that fakesta
And the Brownsville niggas from the past
That run up, put a hammer to ya gut, and tell ya drop it in the bag
You gangsta, Paul whatever (ha ha), cause for real if I ever ever (what)
Ever ever catch yo ass flippin', I'm gonna pop a collar (Boom)
Woo mack and when your bitch holla

Fabolous,"[Mary J. Blige]
All my love is all I have
All my life I look for you

[Fabolous]
I'm just Fab, I see how Mary be now
But I can barely be found
And I rarely be round
But when I do, the jury be drowned
And you can see how clear the Pile Vase, and the Canaries be now
The top on the 5 series be down
And I'm chillin' where them little houses on the prairie be now
Although there was a time I would barely see fowls
But I'm gettin' a multi-million dollar yearly fee now
Girls, don't even know me, want to marry me now
Dudes, I thought was homies, want to bury me now
That's why I keep a bulletproof vest, no matter where we be now
And I carry three pounds, and nearly three rounds
I take whatever the verdict from the jury be now
Rather than friends, it's pallbearers that carry me round
Everybody staring unnecessarily now
But there's no tints on my lights, so you can clearly see now

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
All my love is all I have
And my dreams are very special
All my life I looked for you
And today your dream come true
You need me and I need you
Lovin' us is very special
Lovin' life and life and livin'
Your very special

[Fabolous]
Y'all can never be built like me, even if Y'all look at my blueprint
But since Y'all watches look like its movement
I'll show you how video games look on the new Sprint
Flip out digital screens, look in the new Bent
100 and flat screens, look in the new Pint
Even our Air Forces lookin' to new tints
I stay away from anythin' that look like a nuisance
But y'all gotta peep this rookie's improvement
I tip it with you and
Cause most dudes was doin' verses for a few dollars and a hook for a few cents
All I do is try to teach and look to influence
But it look like the students are playin' hooky, and truin'
And some say that we lookin' like new gents
But money talks, and it don't look like Y'all fluent
And Y'all done seen how this young'n look in the new pints
But it's my life and you can't look in the new tints

[Chorus]

[Fabolous]
Uh, If I could say so myself, I came a long way
Even though I feel like the same old John J.
Nothin' change, when I aim, I'm gonna spray
When I eat, I order the same old entree
When I ride, I let the same old songs play
And when I work, I do the same old long days
From bein' Fab, to looked at by dames the wrong way
They know where we came, from the name they call me
I already know what these lames is gonna say
And I already seen what games they gonna play
Fuck with family, don't say the name the wrong way
And when you die, Y'all crackers gonna blame it on strays

[Mary J. Blige]
Cause love is life, and life is livin'
Your very special

Me and Fab are very special
Me and Fab are very special",My Life
Fabolous,"Uh, yes I am often imitated
But I am never duplicated, yeah
Yes I am often imitated
But I am never duplicated

I can't deny it, you's a dick rider
You can never flow like me, blow like me
Why would a bitch like ya?
She can see that I'm a fucking rider, you a hitch hiker
I'm walking in some shoes, they can't make fit ya
Got millions of paper that you can't take with ya
I don't want to talk and I can't take pictures
Listen to your demo, I'll handshake with ya
Excuse you, who's you?
If I need a stunt double I'll use you
Pardon y'all, I don't want to step on y'all toes
separate the authentic from the replica flows
And the kid be places you could never be at
So that can never be this, and this can never be that
These niggas got some audacity
Sell some records as fast as me
Or sell some tickets out as fast as me
Motherfucker

[Chorus: x2]
Yes I am often imitated (yes he is often imitated)
But I am never duplicated (but he is never duplicated)

So all that y'all can do is hate it

None of these wannabes really come close
I feel like I'm watching the MTV show Christina Milian hosts
Everybody know this brother got it
Way before everybody and their mother got it
They still wonder how he sound like he do
If I was you, I'd want to sound like me too
'Cause I got M's, they got G's and they all right
But they not me
They hear how I spit it on a station
Now they want to put me on they singles just to get an imitation
No, I can't make an appearance
Give you a cheap fee or break on a clearance
I'm what your label hoped it could be
That's why they trying to mould your little ass, into a sculpture of me
With the ladies it'll be like leader, she like real
y'all trying to be like me and be like ill

[Chorus: x2]

So all that y'all can do is hate it

I'm real
It's the way I talk, the way I walk
It ain't my fault
I won't let nothin' on two legs stop me
'Cause the real is always better than the bootleg copy
Like I ain't show 'em the white and yellows at the same time
Throw backs and pin wheels at the same time
Like I'm scared to drop at the same time
I'll show you how to do this young'n
I ain't frontin'
These Jordan's ain't comin'
It ain't nothin'
Keep the complaints comin'
Can't hop on my bandwagon
Jump in my blue flames
You should not try, you are not I
It's the dude with the Grammy grin
It's no relation if it ain't a street family kin
So won't the real Fabolous please stand up
Please stand up
Please stand up

[Chorus: x2]

So all that y'all can do is hate it",Never Duplicated
Fabolous,"Yea, I ain't scared of you motherfuckers
I ain't no killer right
But y'all niggas gon' make me one
For real, leave me alone, shit
You fucking with the wrong one brother
I'm telling ya

I'm sitting in the crib dreaming about killing ya
With machine guns shotties and desert E dilligers
Putting a bullet as big as a battery through a niggas anatomy
And watching him die slow
You need full clips to push up in the joint
When you in the kinda truck that I push up to the joint
'cause theses motherfuckers will push him to the point
That you'll end up locked down doing push ups in the joint
But they'll box you in the corner
And you can throw ya fists up and act like you a boxer on his corner
Ride wit ya gun in your glove box instead of on ya
You'll be six feet deep in one of them boxes if you want to
Not me, I squeeze the clips drop from the handle
Till your remains is in a urn on top of the mantle
Till everybody scramble off the block like they Randall (run)
Till there's a murial on your block and some candles
Who want to die?

[Chorus:]
I don't want to kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin' punk
I don't want to kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin' chump
I don't want to kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin' clown
'cause I'ma have to kill someone just to get some respect

My Teflons will have you screaming like Wyclef Jean (someone please call 9-1-1)
But if they ever get the watch on my left arm
I'ma have more bury than that guy Stephon
First they put that white seed over you brother
Then the newspapers put you all over the cover
Then you in a suit one hand cross over the other
Next you in the earth with the dirt over you brother
A tinted hearse is what most men leave in
Followed by a limo full of family and close friends greaving
When you pull the marijuana
I'ma want to kill you as bad as The Terminator wanted Sarah Connor
But I'm loosing my patience
Fuck it send me to the island I could use a vacation
Now it's easy for me to understand
How you could just kill a man

[Chorus]

I'd rather be judged by twelve
Than carried by the six
My gun ain't on my man, or carried by my chicks
My gun ain't in my crib or carried in the six
If I'm right here nigga, then this right here nigga
Picture me putting my hearse
Like I ain't gotta a clip full a hollow tips to put in these jerks
I might as well put in the work
Spit em up outta here and get em up outta here
I got the juice like bishop had wit him
That just don't give a fuck, semi
Like ol' dog had wit him
I'm saying prayers for my enemy
I hope god bless him before the fucker run into me
I dunno, what the fuck has got into me
But I know I don't want them slugs going into me
I'm just trying to live my life
So niggas better give me my respect or give me life

[Chorus]

Look what you made me do man
Look what you made me do man
I didn't want it to come to the right
But fuck it,
Niggas will push you to that point man
Niggas will play with you so much man
Aggravate you so much man
That you want to kill a nigga man

The clips in the sets be thick
And I done slipped more shots in then Gretzky's stick
I'm the one like Penny Hardaway's number
That's why dudes say it's hard to keep my broad away from ya
Once your bitch, get the god 2-way number
It'll be hard to get a Happy Father's Day from ya

Shorty! just shake your hips slow and move wit me
Take a hit a this and sip slow and thoroughly
You're sneakin' out on your man, tip-toein' to the V
Cause I know you got him whipped though like wannabe
Let's put on a live strip show just you and me
But girl, I'm lookin' at them lips though like who is he?
They ain't never seen a whip, clothes or jewelry
So when I ask ""you want to leave the zip-code?""
Say ""sure"" and be me

[Chorus 1: Fabolous]
But this is my party
Stroll by if you want to
Or y'all can stay home
But why would you want to?

[Fabolous]
We gon' party, till we laid in graves
Sweat out our doobie braids and waves
Then scream ""hey-hey-hey yo""
That groupie made her wait
Cause when she seen the whips and chains
She started talking 'bout she ready to be made a slave, c'mon

[Chorus 2: x2]

So get fly if you want to
Get high if you want to cause I know you want to
Put your hands up as high as you want to
And if it feels good scream ""hey-hey-hey yo""

But we doin' it over here
All the glasses got liquid that brewin' it over here
Cigars got somethin' sticky that's glueing it over here
Ladies movin' it over there, movin' it over here
I can fit a few in a Rover's rear
We havin' a good time, don't ruin it overs this
You see why we asks is to see ID
Cause girls will do anything for some VIP access
Me I relax this (easy)
Cause I'm used to ballin'
You could tell that these guys need practice
But if it was a problem then I would confront you
You saying ""over"" bet ya I say ""you want to""
But a pitcher that probably slugs, pitches and talk a put
I ride wit the top down and switch to the top-up look
Would you believe most these bitches go bop up shook
Their asses pokin' out like them pictures in pop up books

[Chorus 2] 

[Fabolous]
Oh yea! We's off the Richter Scale
Hate will get you, put in coffins quick as hell
If the ladies would show it off and thick as hell
For my hustlers knockin' off them bricks as well
And everybody, up north that's sick in jail
I probably feel y'all, send you all of the flicks in mail
The Street Family speed off six SL's
To all them chicks at Yale ""hey-hey-hey-hey yo""
Shake your glasses back and forth to mix it well
Shake your ass back and forth as quick as hell
And just from lookin' at them thighs from the front view
Girl I know that these guys say they want you
If I wake up in the sand, clothes from yesterday
Same hoes from yesterday 
Lightin' clips to the same dro' from yesterday
Her hang-overs yesterday
You ain't mistaken we in Benz's today
But we had them Range Rovers yesterday

Ya know, catch me if you can nigga

Throwback this, throwback that
It ain't where you from its where you wear ya throwback at
I rock the reds pete rose when I'm in the 'natti
And [repeat: x4]
You cant see the semi-automatti
When I'm in the chi' you think they ain't that shocked
To see the kid roll through in the st. pats socks
So pull out the Chicago and the script to wear on soul train
The bulls, when mike had hair and a gold chain
I get the spirit in St. Louis, how could the god lose
I do back flips in the ozzie cardinals
They love me in Cleveland, every time I travel there
I'm in the Indians or that cavaliers
When I hit Minnesota, that kid from brooklyn wear
The vikings or the Timberwolves from Garnett's rookie year
And in Milwaukee I had to pimp it and go back
20 years with the bucks and brewers throw backs

[Chorus:]
Throwback this, throwback that
They even look better with the matching hat
All you gotta check is the players stats
It ain't where you from its where you wear ya throwback at
Throwback this, throwback that
They even look better with the matching hat
All you gotta check is the players stats
It ain't where you from its where you wear ya throwback at

I might charge through San Diego with the bolts on my shoulder
Rock the trailblazer warm-up, cause Portland gets colder
And even the pimps be jealous
When I'm in the floor seat at the forum in the m.p.l.s.
And they be askin' what teams on the kid chest
This the rams before they moved to the midwest
When I'm in the bay with it, I don't play with it
I'm in the athletics with the matchin' A's fitted
This ain't even for the minors
Cause they don't know nothin' bout the Joe Montana, 49ers
Seattle, probably heard different rumors
Either about the Payton or the Griffey Jr.
I come through Denver like 4th quarter with Elway
Or the nuggets that make them yell 
In phoenix I do the old suns
Cause the new jerseys is cool, but nothings really like the old ones
Ya know

[Chorus]

In new york what I wear the the club may vary
Mets or Yankees like the subway series
When I'm in Boston I melt the bean
In a hot red Soxs or Celtics green
In the city of Philly, I roll up on the biddes like feel these
In a size 56 Phillies
In jersey I got the nets on
That you can bet on
In d.c. I couldn't pull it
Without the bullets
When I stop in Atlanta I cant talk long
Them birds know I got the falcons or the hawks on
That peach Tampa bay don't hit the streets too often
Not even Miami could take the heat of dolphins
Ain't no complaints on
When I'm in New Orleans with the saints on
In Houston I pass hoes
In the Astros
In Dallas I always gotta have
The cowboys or the mavs
? to keep it coming, and I'ma keep it coming

White, yellow, and a little something that bling green

All, baby girl, I'd trade it all

I assume I'm so into you
'Cause even before we hit the bedroom, I was friends with you
If they ask, I ain't gotta say whom in them interviews
My sweet thing, never believe them rumors that been a true
The fact I had numerous friends is true
But you was wifey could change me into a groom in a mintue, Boo
Maybe my sense of humor gets into you
But girl, they can make a perfume from the scent of you
I wanna take you where it feel like June in December, too
So what you think about Cancun 'til the winter through
I don't know what the other consumers you been with do
I put a day aside to go to Bloomies and spend with you
Like any other man, I woulda zoomed to the clinic, too
Now I wanna see if me and my junior's identical
A dude put a wound on the skin of you
I swear to everything that same afternoon will begin to move, feel me

So I could take you places you don't often be
Come on, ma, come and get lost with me
As far as them other chicks, can't get 'em off-a me
Everlastin' love in a whole other fashion
All I'm askin', let me cash in
'Cause I give all the passion, all of the Sean John flashin'
In orderly fashion, perhaps when
You figure out exactly what Diddy about
'Cause we can take this whole city out
Now who gon' stop us, who gon' knock us
Top us, we can't find coppers to lock us
Leer jets and choppers, love hella proper
Separate the weak from the obsolete

Yo', this newcomer's known to move with the seasons
Couple winter lodges, few summer homes
I'm there for every ooh, umm, and moan
And make sure when the new Hummer roams
The shoes come in chrome
I ain't new at buyin' white, yellow, and cucumber stones
That send chills through a woman bones
But life gets gruesome
Even though I got the kinda bread that won't matter if a few crumbs are blown
Flights I don' flew some alone
Now I wanna wake up every day with you in a new number zone
Mamamia it's you I'ma phone
Just to erase all the negative views from your dome
And I promise this fella's G
And so gangster it'll calm all that jealousy
And drama you tellin' me
So mama come yell at me
So I could put the top down and we could cruise like Tom and Penelope

Girl, I'd trade it all, money, cars and everything (My charm is a felony)
All, even give up my street dream
All, anything to have you on my team
All, baby girl, I'd trade it all

Even give up my good green
All, and I'd give the watch and pinky ring
All, anything to have you on my team

Yeah, I'm a Ghetto Superstar nigga
Most niggas trying to get one chick, right?
I'm trying to get two
You know, two is always better than one, right?
Yeah

I'm trying to kill two birds with one stone 
It's 151's prone, that have you and hun's stoned
Trying the unknown 
Doing things I know y'all parents wouldn't con-done
It's you, her and me; eyes too blurred to see
Speech too slurred to G
But you know ""Young'n"" would love ta
See ya upon each other, feeling on me while tongue'n each other
Wow! it's a wonderful thing 
To have a pretty female under each wing
The cake can prob'ly Pollie, both of these Bobby Darlies
That take off their Rockavalis?
My job is narly from getting slobbed on Harley's
Getting smoke from the supplier, robbin' Marley
I hope this ain't tooking wrong
But ma now I wanna see how both of y'all look in thongs

I got a bad bitch on my left side (oww)
Bad bitch on my right side (okay)
I suggest it be best if we get by
Said a bad bitch on my left side (oww)
Bad bitch on my right side (okay)
I suggest it be best if we get by

I'm willing to geese 'em if they feeling a threesome
I'm pulling up in the GT before the dealers release them
I ain't with the blazay blah
Cause I hold the record for the most Menage à Trois and lama taje (?)
I got a bad chick on my left lap
Bad chick on my right lap
Do as I suggest, I confess
At my request they gon' get right
So when you see lipstick on both cheeks
That mean I slip dick in both freaks
They started calling me Two Time Johnny
After repeatedly leaving the club wit two damn mami's
This brother done had 'em
From close friends, the girls all know each other from Adam
I'm always this humble boo, HELL YES!
It's cool for your girlfriend to come through too

I got a bad bitch on my left side (oww)
Bad bitch on my right side (okay)
I suggest it be best if we get by
Said a bad bitch on my left side (oww)
Bad bitch on my right side (okay)
I suggest it be best if we get by

At the most it'll take an hour together
To get these girls from dancing wit each other
In to taking showers together
They know, it's a studio in Fab crib
One of y'all can rock the mic while the other one ad libs
Boo, my government is personal 
But I got enough sets of twins to make Doublemint commercials
After trying X, I can only imagine what y'all be trying next
The stacks that I be splurging have girls in the back of the Excursion
Forgetting bout the fact that they was virgins
I don't care who you bringing wit you
Just let her know that I'm poking her while I'm fingering you
I love that thing that you do
And I know about the tongue and nipple
But I ain't know you had a ring in it too
I can tell when they came, cause they start spelling my name
Like F-A, B-O, L-O, U-S (oww)

I got a bad bitch on my left side (oww)
Bad bitch on my right side (okay)
I suggest it be best if we get by

I got no choice but to slut her
'Cause I'm in a 10-6 with the vase up that look somethin like a nutta butta dutta dutta
Mami you'll be in saint tropez

Ridin jet skis and mopeds
Powderin like dope heads
Paparazzi snappin pictures they must thin you J.Lopez(BIATCH!!!)

[Chorus]

you could be prancin through ghettos
in a pair of fendi's or pants and stillettos
all you gotta do is swallow some kids like that witch did in Hansel and Gretel
who's as handsome as ghetto

this mans earings look transparent
and my mtchell and s throwbacks be so old they could be somebodys grandparents
I want the type of money athletes consume
I have to assume

I'm no fool,but I'm so cool,when i walk in feels like there's a draft in the room
(oooh)I'm so sick i drive em reverse fast

They ask for it
so i put TV's in the headrest and the dashboard
and you gotta catch it on tape 'cause when the truck stops rims still look like they on fast forward
i'm sippin liquor the color of smurf's skin as long as the earth spins

and you'll get sea sick,'cause my waves be thick enough for them cali dudes to surf in

[Chorus]",Damn
Fabolous,"What what what what what
Right, right ghetto

I'm somethin' like a phenomenon,
But still dumpin' whenever the drama's on,
Y'all hustlers can't eat fit meals,
And it feels somethin' like when it's Ramadan,
Hope you chumps been walkin' with armor on,
Somethin's turnin' his momma on,
I love to see rumps in Farragama thongs
Bet it look plump when you got pajama's on,
Jump in, let's hit the Bahama's ma',
And it's crunk whenever I'm on the song,
Bumpin' like ""Bumb-ba-Bump,""
I'm particularly picky,
When it comes to licky licky,
Have 'em slidin' off them Vickie's quickly,
Under the doo-rag thick three sixty,
It's the hypno and sticky icky,
I said Okay!

I'm fly enough, to do better,
But pimp enough to not give a fuck,
And I'm thug enough, to do better,
And gangsta enough to not give a fuck,
I'm hustlin' enough, to know better,
But ballin' enough to not give a fuck,
And I'm, old enough, to know better,
But young enough to not give a fuck

D-d-d-d-dammit man,
I'm in a throwback so old,
It'll make your grandma glance,
And everybody know, everybody go,
So please, call the stretch ambulance,
These dudes don't stand a chance,
When I pull up like the pamper brand,
Those in the Lambo slants,
With a madame from France,
With a ass so big,
You couldn't hide it in hammer pants,
Who else be in New York,
With Miami tans,
Got everybody doin' the street family dance,
I'm sure this hammer can,
Make you save that gangsta role for the camera man,
F-A-B, you preferably,
Don't wanna F wit me,
Please believe it,
I'm definitely, as responsible,
For gettin' the City High as 'Clef would be,
Believe it please

[Chorus]

I'm introduced to your women friends,
'Cause I buy double deuces to rent a Benz,
Like they boots made by Timbaland,
I have to remind, since I got drafted and signed,
Y'all playa's get used to the scrimagin'
Not one of the Jesus's got lemon gems?
Y'all lips get loose like y'all feminine,
I prove letting loose but the semi can boost my adrenaline,
You never had no use with that lem again,
Half my roots is Dominican,
Faboloso mi gusto Le bengamins,
This dude got the juice of a pimp in him,
Turn to stones like Medusa got a glimpse of them,
But right now you can lie and gossip too,
And later be the guy the dude spoke to,
And right now you can try to prosecute,
But later in you goin' die in the hospital

Yo these niggas can't breathe when I come through, hum too
Some shoes, gotta be twenty man
It's not even funny they can't breathe!
The choke holds too tight
The left looks too right
You know what? You right
These bitches can't breathe!
Look look, they hearts racin'
They start chasin'
But I'm so fast when I blow past
That they can't breathe!
In the presence of the man
Your future looks better than ya past if you present with the man
You better breathe!

You niggas can't share my air
Or walk a mile in the pair I wear
And I'm getting better year by year
Like they say Juan do
Cops couldn't smell me if you brought the canines through
And I pace myself
I know these money hungry bitches want to taste my wealth
But I keep em' on a diet
Embrace they health
Or either keep em' on a quiet
And space myself
And just take a deep breath
I got em' grabbin' they chest
'Cause it's hurtin' em' to see Fab in his best
And they in they worst
They rather see me lay in the hearse than lay in the back
And I ain't just laying a verse
I'm saying the facts
I came back with some sicker stones
That got these broke niggas looking at me like they chokin' on a chicken bone
Every chick I bone
Can't leave the dick alone
So I know
It's one of them every time I flip my phone

In the presence of the man
Your future looks better than ya past if you present with the man
You better breathe!

I see em on the block when I passes
Looking like they need oxygen mask-es
I make it hard to breathe!
But I keep the glocks in the stashes
'cause the cops want to lock and harass us
And make it hard to breathe!
They has to react
Like havin' a asthma attack
When they see the plasma in back
You dudes are wheezin' behind me
My flow is like a coupe, breezing at ninety
That's the reason they signed me
It's quick metaphors and hard punches on the cuts
Feels somethin' like hard punches to the gut
How I address the haters and under estimaters
And ride up on them like they escalators
They shook up and hooked up to respirators
On they last breath talking to investigators
I'm a breath of fresh air
And a fresh pair
Face it boo and do it till your face get blue

Yo these niggas can't (breathe)
When the crew walk in it
Pop a few corks in it
As quick as a tick in a New York minute
Catch a breath, fore you catch a left
Even worse, catch a Tef
Only way you catch a F
To the A-be, its in the maybe
Rollin with my baby
Gripping on a toy that you won't find in ""KB""
I rhyme slick on ya
I'm a have to put the Heimlich on ya
What you know bout lettin' dimes lick on ya?
While you inhale the weed
And it won't stop till they inhale ya seed
And it don't stop I tell em' to breathe
Like a doctor with a stethoscope
I don't see no fucking hope
Unless these motherfuckers breathe!

Yeah, Brooklyn gotta
Uptown gotta
The Bronx gotta
Queens gotta
Staten Isle gotta
You niggas gotta
You bitches gotta
Everybody breathe!

Two and then the three
Three and then the four
Then you gotta, breathe!
Then you gotta,
Then you gotta,

[Intro]
Fab... [5X]
Can you be my be	-A-be	-why?

[M.S.:] I'll never call another lover mine
[Verse 1: Fabolous]
And why would I, and why should I
When I seen a lady tonight, with my good eye that I would try and make
My..(baby..baby)
I was up in the club putting my hood high
When I saw you, and I stood by
Just lookin at your onion girl I could cry, and I could lie
I mean I could try and say you ain't sweep me off my feet
But only one thing could keep me off the street
And that's if you be my, be	-A-be	-why
I can be why you always be fly
And I'm from be	-Stuy, just like B.I...G. was, that's how F-A-be	 does
We can sip something 'til we both be buzzed
In a V-dub and that's only be-cause

[Chorus: Mike Shorey]
Need someone to be my (baby)
Kind of girl you find in the club rockin those (baby) Phat jeans
Gonna find someone to be my (baby)
..I see some ladies tonight that should be having my (baby, baby)

[Verse 2: Fab]
After the baby talk, the goo goo ga ga
You like this, that, you do bla bla
Couple good jokes, a few brouhaha's, it's time to do you mama
First I'ma put you on your back
And make you scream out (baby)..just like I put you on the track

Then I'ma lay you on your side
And slowly stroke you while you telling me the way you feel inside
But my sex drive won't make me play you on the side
You know you get the keys any day you want to ride
And my baby know how to start me up
You got the kind of kiss that'll speed a heartbeat up
And you got the kind of touch that'll gimme the chills
I ask you 'cause I know you gonna gimme it real
It won't be fake, and don't we make a good couple
And won't we make a good...(baby)?

[Bridge: Mike Shorey]
Ooh, if I seem just a bit taken, pardon me
But you're so amazing
I just want us to do this exclusively
Say you'll be my baby

[Verse 3: Fab]
My baby's the only one I bring to the villa
That can get the bling and the scrilla
Girl, I know you smooth enough to spring a chinchilla
And still take a sting of Tequila, the way you swing is a thriller
I'm watchin that like the boxing match in the ring of Manila
I want to keep it comin like the singles of ""Thriller""
I mean if you still uh..my be	-A-be	-why

[Chorus]
[Intro: 'til end]",Baby
Fabolous,"[Chorus:]
'cause now I ain't wit cha, know that I miss ya, some how I carry on
I can still picture, when I was wit cha like you was never gone
I remember the good times, all of the bad times
I dedicate this song, to my niggas laid out, til my niggas lay down
Can Ya Hear Me, I know you hear me

[Fabolous]
Now we was once two niggas of the same kind
Quick to holla at a bitch with the same lines
Quick to draw on a nigga with the same nines
But at the same time we was on some different shit
'cause you was with a bitch that I beg to differ wit
I told you sniff a bit and you could get a whif of it
But you kept a closed nose when it came to those hoes
And I'm your nigga so I tried to smell em wrong for ya
Wasn't there to take the fault for ya, But if you hear me
I dedicate this song for ya, He was setup in a stick up
By a girl he used to pick up on the upper west side
I used to help him chop a brick up, They found him in his pickup
Pants down and dick up, leaning with one in his head
And one in his chest, One of the best at this husslin' shit
But his downfall was that he put his trust in a bitch and it's fucked up

[Chorus]

[Fabolous]
I remember selling three bricks of raw powder
Turn my man into a star in 24 hours
He didn't care spent the money in like 4 hours
On a Benz with like 400 and Horsepower
And a chain that had christ on it, a rollie with a lot of Ice on it
A pinky ring with a price on it, when he come around
Its likely that he blunted
With a pretty lady in them Nike's that you wanted
It's well know he kept it on his hip like a cell phone
If you speak with him you can pick up on his jail tone
He used to say he wasn't going back without blowing back
And now I'm black I wouldn't put it past him
The D's would Harass him, til he finally blacked out
They told my nigga to freeze, but he still backed out
Shots fired 'til his trigger finger got tired
All the newspapers said was 'Another Nigga Dead'
And it's fucked up

[Chorus]

[Fabolous]
You can catch me in a cherry red 8-50 nice ass
Great titties, face pretty everybody know that she date smitty
A big time dealer that's doing a state biddin
Who did more than his share of dirt in the world
Enough to make a nigga think about hurtin' his girl
So he used to tell his queen to stay to the castle
Away from the hassle to the day that he pass through
There's some enemies he might have who may want to blast you
She stayed for a few years, that's until a few pairs
Convinced her to come and hang out around New Year's
It's been awhile, you can see it in her smile
And she ran into her man's Co-Defendant in the trial
Who started going on about how he moving on
About running with them same niggas Smitty had warned about
She slid off told her girl, she had to drop her kid off
They found her in the parking lot, somebody blew her lid off
And it's fucked up

[Chorus: x2]",Can You Hear Me
Fabolous,"[Reverend preaching]
Ha ha ha haa
Brothers and sisters we're gathered here today
to listen to a young man that's on fiiya
You sittin in the church wit Reverend Charlie Murphy
and I'ma bring it to ya wit brother F-A-be	-O-L-O-you-S

[Rev.:] Preach to 'em Brother, Church
[Fab:] Yea, Uh.. uh.. uh.. uh

[Verse 1]
Yo, I preach through my raps
God is watchin me I still reach to my strap
Broads is watchin me they want to leech to my trap
Tha Jesus Christ on my neck reach to my lap
I teach you to rap in my Sunday School
These bitches get a one day rule
You gotta fuck be Monday, cool?
Or she gotta stroke a stick like the hun play pool
If not you gotta walk like a runway fool
Catch me in the moon shine or the sun ray jewels
If you keep sayin your prayers maybe one day you'll..
..be blessed like me 'til then keep stompin in your Air Force O-N-E-S Nikes
They should make scriptures wit my flows
I'm the young Bishop Don Juan that stripped ya for your hoes
So if I throw a dollar at ya scream Hallelujah
While I grab the neck of my robe and pop a collar to ya
Church

[Reverend preaching]
Now in this world that we live in, there's all kinds of pimps
You got ya playas, ya ballas, ya macs, ya gorrilla
pimps that take what they want
Ya all-star pimps... Pimps that (?)
Pimps wit nothin but the Gators on ya feet (Preach to em brother)
Nice pimps, mean pimps

[Verse 2]
I feel like the angel of God
All I gotta do is drive the Range through and nod
It's like I was put here to put layers in the air
Put squares in my ear, put squares in the chair
Put pairs in the rear
I even put 20 inch footwear in my spare
Lord knows I gotta stay on them spinners
Dis verse is like grace that you say on your dinners
Girls come wit me knowin that they gonna be sinners
But, I'ma sense of relief
And I ain't never been a trick kinda like its against my belief
If she got it from me then I'm convinced she a thief
But they say God giveth and He taketh away
And I can do the same thing when I shake with the 'K
If a nigga make a mistake wit the pay, Goddamit
At the club I get right in
So if heaven got a ghetto I should fit right in
God loves me

[Reverend preaching]
Now just what kind of ho are you?
Are you a tough ho, or a soft ho? (That's right)
Are you a big ho, or a little ho? (Lil' teenie weenie)
A domestic ho, or an international ho?
A rich ho, or a broke ass ho?

[Verse 3]
Yea, me momma got my name from the Baptist who made
tha wrong moves wit the women and died for it
You make the wrong moves when you come and you try for it
New York City of God
I 'den saved some of New York's prettiest broads
I'm spittin the gospel
I hit my apostle's wit the coke that'll heal a sick
soon as it get in they nostrils
A Dros Trios, bring the organs on ya
A 40-Caliber'll turn ya to a organ donor
And a day or two, you'll be a morgue aroma
While I go city to city fillin the pieu's up
I ask God to forgive me while I'm fillin the Uz' up
Demons won't let me see a man fillin my shoes up
I ease 'em wit a sermon, but that ain't hard
When I'm in the Beamer before they released 'em to the Germans
You prolly got the man you love wit you
But wouldn't you rather have the Man above wit you?
Can I get an Amen

[Reverend talking]
Now some of ya'll are pimps, And some of ya'll are hoes
But the rest.. the rest of ya'll.. don't think I don't know
Ya just a hater.. They hate what you got
They put a black eye on on the game whenever they play
They piss in the pool, And they fart on the elevator
Then look you in the face, Like they think you did it
They hate change (They hate change)
And they hate progress
They hate me and they hate you
They hate they own momma
'cause they think its her fault that they ain't got shit
But I'm here to tell ya today
That if you a hater
Then you are the outter take or your own business (Amen)
And someody just put 25 dollars in the collection plate
So I'ma go up on the corner
And buy me a fish sandwich
why'all hold it down, I'll be right back

Birds love how a brother ride, truckin it sick
I'm heard of on the southern side, i pluck through it quick
I been one of them boys since way back when
This is way before a nigga brought grey plaques in
So if i spray mac-10s, Bet you niggas lay back then
Like you sittin in a Maybach Benz
Yea I made crack grins but ain't a damn thing funny
I keep a pocket fulla do the damn thang money
I keep it comin with bottles of champagne dunny
So keep it bouncin till you pull a hamstring honey
These pimps just better have a gothic for me
I got them hoes starin like they got a problem with me
I got them boys slingin rocks in the lobby for me
I'm rich bitch, ballin just a hobby for me

[Chorus]
I got a pocket full of money and my wrist all froze
So fuck what you heard we don't love them hoes, heeyyy
Do the damn thang, do the damn thang
A nigga might grin but it ain't still funny
Got a pocket fulla that, do the damn thang money, heeyy
Do the damn thang, do the damn thang

[Young Jeezy]
My phone is tapped and so is my livin room
We can't hide the money here, we need a bigger room
Let me show you what I stand fo,
Jesus Schwarzenegger call me commando
On that Remy Martin, nigga matta fact
I ain't Fat Joe but I can make em lean back
Save your ammo don't waste it
Got him dodgin bullets like he in the matrix
Jeans strapped and ya better dip
Carvin 15, got six clips
Pilsbury nigga, got a lotta dough
Call me bossan george, got a lotta hoes
They place orders, so I bake cakes
I'm a bodybuilder, pump a lotta weight
You see the diamonds in my damn chain
It ain't hard to tell, I do the damn thang

[Chorus]

[Fabolous]
You waitin instead of participatin with them boys
You skatin on them 22 datins like them boys
I'm hatin that they communicatin with them boys
I'm waitin just to send them to Satan for that shit
They see a nigga stones look sick
And I gotta stack of singles in my hand that's phone booth thick
'Cause I'm so hood rich
That I'm no good bitch
And even if she gotta pimp then a hoe should switch
And get ridda that shit spitta, get wit her, shit gitter
sit wit her, hit spitter, that don't bitch chitter
My style fit wit her
I tell her you don went left now you need to go right like a switch hitta
I know them tricks bitter
When I'm in the six with her
So I'm in a mix with her
forty four six with her
And I'm higher than a motherfucker
But a nigga try then he gon die in this motherfucker

Fabolous,"It's been a year and some change
And I've been hearin' some things
That there's some motherfuckers tryin' to be me

So I won't stop, and I don't stop, yeah

It's like everywhere I look and everywhere I go
I'm hearin' muh'fucka's tryin'a steal my flow
But it ain't no thing cause see my nigga J.O
Put me up on the game when I stepped through the do'
Now I done been so many places and seen so many faces
But none of these motherfuckers do it like me
Don't no motherfuckin' click do it like we
Guess I'm doin' the right thing like Spike Lee
See they talk like they some ho's, I walk like I'm supposed
But if they get in the way they get stepped on
It's the hundred-thou with the bling kept on
Dippin' on my semi-automatic weap-on
I ain't playin' no games, and I ain't sayin' no names
Nigga put the shoes on if they fit you
Well there's two things that I'm gon' admit to
That I won't stop, and I don't stop

It don't stop, it won't stop

I take whatever come wit the wealth, and even humble myself
But I ain't the kinda nigga you can style on
I got a coupe that I'm finna' put some miles on
And I ride on these niggaz wit a smile on
See I'm 'bout stackin' money but when they start actin' funny
I fall back and all a man do is laugh
I'm the kinda player that ain't gotta do the draft
Buncha hits, couple plaques nigga do the math
But a nigga must be gone for gettin' his hustle on
So I had to come through and take the corner back
And I'm back wit the rubber bands on a stack
Nigga quit or take what I give on a pack
Girls still think I'm fly
Blow kiss and wink the eye
And tell me they want to go somewhere and freak off
I tell 'em I would love to stop and take the week off
But I won't stop, and I don't stop

[Chorus:]

I listen to niggaz flippin' my lines
And be grippin' my nine
Like damn niggaz flip and only spit game
Niggaz comin' at me tryin' to get names
Niggaz lookin like me tryin' to get fame
See first it didn't matter, and I was a little flattered
But now these young boys they gettin' too grown
Like I ain't show 'em how to rock jewels two toned
But it won't stop, and it don't stop
Yeah

Fabolous,"My youngins get it fucked up when y'all talk about the game
Like it's designed in their favor
Like it ain't outlined for them to waiver
Their rights for a lil' bit of fame

Get in bullshit fights for a lil' name
To get noticed by some niggas that don't give two fucks about you
Tell 'em you don't do the jives and shucks, and they route you to the shelf
See there's no money in good health

So they need you to be sick with it, ill content and delivery niggas
This nation thrives off misery niggas
So if you ain't trying to let your hard times increase your wealth
Niggas keep that progressive shit to yourself

This is the business of buying souls, and we only tryin' to fuck with those who trying to sell them
See, they may see me as an adversary 'cause they know I'm tryin' to tell them 
About the forest of artists who grow only to meet industry axes
How they take niggas dreams and write then off in their taxes

Contracts is confusing, but don't worry they'll appoint you a lawyer for you whore you
Loan you funds to fuck your soul make you pay it back and still maintain control of your stroll
Your tracks and your hot ass slow flow
they'll keep you looking good and all that, but no dough

You see when that get a bitch, they got a bitch
And contrary to popular opinion it ain't my sistas that switch
It's my brothers
We the dumb motherfuckers

Hardest niggas in the streets turned industry suckers
'Cause we refused to do the knowledge
Nigga, you can't learn this music game in the streets or in college
So you betta pick up a book or something

Or fuck it, FAB will put it in a hook or something
Hope that you listen to it
Got you pumpin' that poison while they paint them illusionary parades and keep pissin' through it
You pussies don't know the price or the sacrifices that this industry makes real niggas walk",Exodus

I'm still living la vida loca
Where hoes sell prices on weed or coke-a
For the hustlers, for the customers, trust the buzz
It's have you makin' one of the sounds that Busta does (woo haha!)
They love me just because
I'm in the gallardo, laughing like Ricky Ricardo (Ha ha ha ha)
With the 4-pounder, pretty gangsta nigga
I'm the co-founder, I know the difference between pimps and hoe-hounders
I can tell when they ain't learn to lean
They gold cups missing stones, turning green
I roll up wrist in chrome, burning green like what's good

God was in a good mood, on the day he made me
I'm from the projects, it's the way it made me
And I wouldn't change it for nothing
I stay on point, that's 'cause I know the danger of stuntin'
But the aim is like I'll be at the ranges or somethin'
It takes a gangsta, to know a gangsta
That's why we look at you like a stranger or somethin'
'cause we can tell by the body language you frontin'
And it take a little more than lettin' ya pants sag
Ya sand bag, tryna jump on the band wag
I'll put the red dot on you like a Japan flag
You need some high heels and a handbag

[Chorus]

I'm in the ten minutes to nine, leanin' on 'em
Like I'm ten minutes behind, fuck a hundred shots
Give me a .40 cal wit' ten in it, I'm fine
Just spray, and shit'll get you ten minute of shine
Keep a friend in it, that's ten cented for mine
Keep the rims in it, that spin in it for mine
Can't see him in it, I been tinted up mine
But you know a nigga look oh so gangsta
Oh no thank ya, I earned my key
My name'll get you fucked up, and burners tee
That's gangsta love, from the heart
Yo I told y'all from the start
And now (y'all know who)
Keep it G'd up, I can't slow down, these creep's speed up

And know who I be! uh!

I got the Yankee leaning, just sitting over to browse
And the G4 is just getting over the clouds
You can't tell me that I ain't what's up right now
I got a bottle of Tequila upside down
There's some chicks wit boyfriends that are up tight now
Cause they know the big 'dog' had a 'pups' like wow
I'm stuck in my city ways
Heading over seas wit a zip of New York City's haze
You rats can keep running through your city's maze
Until you get sprayed with the pesticide
I know you in that hole, you best to hide
Like the rest who tried, who went and testified
Of course your girl wanna slide over and be rubbed
And don't mind taking rides over the G dubs
I ride Rovers on Spre-dubs
Please don't be another dude who died over a ski dub, chill

[Chorus:]
From hood to hood they see what's hood and know who I be
From block to block they see it, not can't know who I be
From state to state they cannot hate, they know who I be
From the east to west, through the Mid West and down south it's Ghetto!
(It's Ghetto-oh!) It's Ghetto! (It's Ghetto-oh!) It's Ghetto!
(It's Ghetto-oh!) It's Ghetto! (It's Ghetto-oh!) It's Ghetto!

I get it jumping like a lo lo '64
And bet they hop on it like a pogo stick pro
I'm chilling wit these go go chicks though
That do the kind of things that belong in a porno flick yo
You know it's him and the gang
With the bling worked on, that remind you of lemon meringue
But remember the things, ain't too far
And y'all wanna hear em go bang bang bang
Like John Witherspoon, I'm watching em closely
I know the snakes gonna slither soon
The two toned Maybach's getting delivered soon
The back feels like sitting in the living room
I'm so hard bodied like the suit on Batman
It's that man that back to back plat' scan
I'm back for the third time, I make words rhyme for a living
You probably heard I'm still ghetto, nigga!

[Chorus]

They tried to put two 9's on me, just like Gretzky
But my lawyer saw through it just like wet tees
I smoke till my eyes look just like Jet Li's
On islands where the water's blue just like Pepsi
Yeah the trigger just might get squeezed
And the slugs will skip over your waves, just like jet skis
Hoes know Ghetto from New York, call em the Fresh Prince
And throw rose petals when I walk
They love how I came back hard like good blow
And I'm still a heart throb to a hood ho
That's what hood though, yes I would know
That's cause I'm in the streets like man hole covers
Rims look like blades when a fan blow brother
I'm waiting on a storm to land, roast others
The man no other, cause I been in it
My time is money, y'all couldn't buy ten minutes
I'm gone! catch up!

They all go crazy over me
Don't matter what part of the world

Girls want to be part of my world

Look, I done had my share
Bringin' round me, is a bad idea
I take Big or small, short or tall
Light or dark, I try them all
'Cause I like
From stupido groupie hoes
To one of these r&b group skio's
I need a slick mouth, thick south, brickhouse
Or I may date, a-rate playmate
Ten in the face, thin in the waist
Tight in the thighs, light in the eyes
Even those

Touchin' wit' manicured claws

And take by the million if they they Brazilian
I'm sailin' wit' a Australian
Or trafficin' wit' the south African
Panamaian or Grenadian

You need to holla at somebody real such as myself
Won't nobody do as much as myself
And its so real ill hop out and get the dutches myself
For a pretty girl as such as yaself
'cause ima busy man I don't see too much for myself
And sometimes it be hard to get in touch with myself
But I, make the time when I have to
Learn to take my time and be careful when dealing wit women
There's some who be willing and skimming
And dive in to relationships 'cause I got a million to swim in
They'll throw it to you faster than schilling and clemens
But feelings ain't the only thing that you can catch now
Some throw lawyers that you hoping they fetch thous
Others pass diseases that you can catch now
But in my minutes so lone I think about this crazy world
And.. I don't want to live in it alone

Ill give you all my love 
And you can always trust
My loyalty, honesty, and security (and i'll never)
Ill never leave (no, no, no)

So holla at somebody real (cause i)

And say whether the storm will leave the gray skies behind you
The fake may try to blind you
That's why I stay fly like I do
And no I can trust everybody that I say hi and bye to
First I need a girl that may die as my boo
Then I may try the I do's
But, I refuse to be trick
Or used by a chick 
Who gets amusement of kicks
Out of abusing my dick
When its real I'm all in it
But I don't want the scars of love that you get when you fall in it
(no) before it didn't matter who
Now I look for some with a little attitude
I could chitter chatter to, good looking
But witty and compatible
Long hair wit a fatty too
And that'll do

For to waste

I need to holla at somebody real could that be you
The feelings that I feel could that be true
Most cats lay where the hood rats be boo
But I'm the kinda cat that strays away
That's til somebody real sways my way
Then I might spend some days always
On a Asia bay
Eating food made the Cajun way
And sippin ga lil saki
Blowing a lil brocoli
But this world is full of fluzi's
And bullshit usually
I pull I'm choosy
And on this joint and at this point
I know I need to holla at somebody real
For real

Help don't show up in my hood

Feel like I'm trapped in my hood
Young kids get clapped in my hood
That's why I'm strapped in my hood, just 'cause you in..my..hood
In..my..hood, in my hood, in my hood

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
I'm always close to..
Feeling like a corner stander, stoop sitter, or hallway post-er
No matter where I go it's always 'posed to, feel just like I'm (in my hood)
Cops drive in it every 5 minutes, look at your faces, pat your waists'
Try to find the stash where the gats and base is, I can't say that they racist
But I know.. it ain't the same in they town
And as fucked up as it may sound (in my hood)
It's 2 ways to make it happen off the streets
Balling on the courts or rapping off the beats
You hear the shells tappin' off the 'crete, when they clappin' off the heat
Then the yellow tape's trappin off the street
But that's the way we was raised
Preying to God, hoping that he keep us out the way of them strays

Everybody raised on 4 wings and beef fried rice
Them mothers are getting younger today
Got one by the hand, one in the stroller and one on the way
We don't have role models
But we got them handguns that hold hollows (in my hood)
Ain't no diplomas or degrees
But you can get high from the aroma of the trees (in my hood)
I know it like navigation, and fuck having patience
I'ma get mine, you better get yours, 'cause everyday is a struggle
And One-Time ride through everyday just to bug you
That's how it is, 'cause your rights be wrong
And everybody got a white T on, when you're in..my..hood

[Verse 3: Fab]
We try to make the most of what we got
You either been hit, or been close to gettin shot (in my hood)
Any nigga that boast be getting got
And dopeheads fiend to get a dose of what we got
And young niggaz be like they slow
But you give them a blunt..bet they roll the weed like a pro
If you trick it's not a problem it gets you laid
But if you stick without a condom, it gets you AIDS
No Sesame Street, kids watch BET
Look up to niggaz that don't got a GED
I know a dude with the deadbeat tag
Kids don't got diapers but he ridin' in the red G-Wag'
In the hood, you and your beef is sure to bump heads
And everybody grew up sleepin on bunk beds
They telling me to vote..and I would
If it made a change in my hood..mu'fucka.

You shockin' it, you a rock it, you a kill it

You know how fast you were going?)
Nah not at all man

I heard about you in the paper, I know you got the toaster strudel 
Yeah I need some backup over here I've got two rap singers)

[Fabolous]
I wonder briefly
Could it be there's no roof above me
Or the 22's underneath me
That's keeping them sirens flashing on my ass
Should I get to pumping the brakes or mashing on the gas?
I'm naturally harassed
And I feel like I'm getting punked, but I don't see Ashton in the grass
Nor is there a camera stashed into the dash
It's a guy in a uniform and a passion that he has
For flashing wit his badge
And shining light in my face
Plus he keep his right hand right by his waist
The wrong move will get a gun right in my face
And they fighting for my life, I'm fighting the case
And I ain't trying to be the story they twist in the press
Like: the young man resisted arrest
Then he started reaching for something that looks like a pistol I guess
So I pulled on a nigga I mean I pulled on the trigger...figures

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I go around the corner what do I see?
Po Po's following me
Asking for my ID who's car I'm driving
Po Po's bothering me
Got me in a lineup, got my hands in cuffs
They don't want to set me free
Trying to bring me down, when they come around
Po Po's fucking with me

[Cain]
Awe shit the jakes are fucking with me again
They hate to see me rich, they'd rather see me stuck in the pen
Every time they walk or pull up beside me
Flash lights in my face asking for my registration and ID
I don't know the reason for the harassment
And the questions they asking
Or the ice grills they get when I'm passing
Or maybe its my fault
Cause I be out all times at night
Doing shit I know I shouldn't plus I don't be ridin right
Smokin' lye, no stash box for me to put the skit
Two warrants, no license and I ain't got insurance yet
I keep a hammer close because foes want to stick me up
But keep my movement swift because Po's want to frisk me up
Since '94 I've been told on by 50 descriptions
And in 10 years not once did they get a conviction
These pigs shouldn't provoke a rider
I'm so tired, they got one more time to fuck wit me before I open fire

Ones for the money and twos for the show
Three must be for the motherfucking po po'

[Fabolous]
Bitch!
They gon' have to put my back on the cement
Before I'm in the back with my knee bent
On my way back to the precinct
I'm back in the G-bent
Black wit the pre-tint
Vanilla aroma to cover the back with the tree scent
The way I ride I know I'm in for a case
But the coupe do 200 so they in for a chase
When it comes to lawyers I got the man Puff uses
That's why you never seen my wrists with handcuff bruises
I got them hollow tips, to stick up in the are's
Detectors in the dash, to pick up on the radar
Stash box in it when I purchased the vehicle
So I don't have a problem wit you searching the vehicle
They probably want to scoop an arrest
I try to throw shots but its cool, I got a coupe like a vest
And 'em troopers will just feel stupid I guess
The slugs will bounce off like they hitting superman's chest, nigga

Shit man a nigga ain't even do shit awe shit here comes this dude right now

[Cop] 
Alright buddy unfortunately you came back straight, you and your buddy
Scain Scholar get the fuck outta here I don't want to see you guys around here again alright

Look take it from Larry lock the rapper, get the fuck outta here
I don't want to see you around here again. and by the way

On them streets
You better keep your hand on them heats
And live what you sayin' on them beats
Real talk..

They ain't walkin' the walk, they just talkin' the talk
Some people look at me as the real talk of New York
I ain't these like these niggaz who be feinin' to front
Like they the first to ever put green in a blunt
Look I don't be meaning to stunt, but I zip down like jeans in the front
In somethin' that you seen and you want
But otherwise I'm cool wit' it
They say only the ones who never had gon' get and act a fool wit' it
Everybody's gangsta through the promotion
Even if they raised in a house wit' a view of the ocean
The bangers is growin' upset
'cause' ya' ass is on t.v. throwin' up sets
And you know you ain't like that
But you'll say that you is
Go and rent a bunch a shit and and then say that its his
You ain't a pimp or you wouldn't go to dinner wit' groupies
Ain't a baller 'cause' you wouldn't put spinners on hoopties

[Hook: x 2]
1-2-3; you don't really want to fuck wit me
Get in the way you could get yourself shot
Fuck the cops, you on my block
Fuckin' wit a gangsta nigga

How can niggaz say they be on the other side of the seas'
Where the steering wheels are on the other side of the v's
And the home look like the spot on the other side of the see's
When they ain't never been on the other side of the p's
I ca' see through em', ya tents are too light
Every sentence you write is far from the truth
You want to be that nigga you are in the booth
But you ain't got the heart, the scars, or the proof
And now you flash ya' shirt tag in our grill
But I'm hearin' you was a dirtbag before the deal
You walk around talkin' how every dime sucked
When they don't even speak to you, nevermind fucked you
Ya' hood sayin' don't come back
Step foot in here, and they gon' put you where you won't come back
Dog, how the fuck you gon' have keys in ya' house
When ya' moms' won't even give you keys to the house loser

[Verse 3]
Nigga you in the mirror, checkin' what your make ups' lookin' like
Tryina fool the world wit' a Jacob look-a-like
Jiving like you hold stacks
But ya' car is ten years old homie, ya' drivin' in a throwback
They gon' strip you, have you runnin' naked next
Without security you like unprotected sex
You ain't never gon' finger a trigger
All you do is look in the mugshot book and finger a nigga
I real recognize real, you'd be a john doe
You livin' in a closet and call it a condo
I don't member you as a slinger that was on the bench
Just a little scrub ass ringer in the tournaments
Now they try to blame the fall of hip hop on fans
Nah, I think its these hip hop con mans
Studio gangstas is played out now
This ain't the eighties, battle raps'll get you laid out

And they say what comes around goes around
So the Cristal rolls ya down til it slows ya down
I got a smoother style
For me it's Slow Motion like Juvenile
Til I pass through ya areas
The SLR, class looking serious, they has to be curious

You never seen one of the nastiest lyricist
Speed through like he in the Fast and the Furious
Like Pharrell, we stand on bars
Girls on us like a fan on stars
500 Grand on cars, you'll see a man on Mars
Before a nigga lay a hand on ours

Catch me in a Diamond chain and a thick Cuban
In the piece looking something like Rick Rubin
Put a grin on ya face, then spin in ya waist
The world look like it's spinning in space

And niggas goin' act up now again
And What goes up must come down
And I'll be here like What's Up now?

I do the Yankee rocking with a lean
Know ya can't knock it when ya clean
Girls want me on they ass like back pockets on the jeans
I just try to plug into the socket in between
Then watch me do my step
At the same time throwing up who I rep
Street fitted damn
No other way to put it to ya ma'am
But they'll look and say Damn
I can throw down like a killa
Put slugs and banana clips that'll slow down gorillas, Girl
Move like you in a Hula Hoop
Then blow me like you trying to cool ya soup, I'm Hot

Well, F-A-Beezy, F-A-Sheezy
To the press suite at the F-O-Ceezy
I'm looking at you, Yeah man
You looking at me, Yeah man

Slow down ma, ya speeding again
You can put the top down and blow weed in the wind
But for now, let yo hips go to this
Betta yet, let ya lips blow a kiss
When I dip low and flip, show the wrist
It looks like a froze hypno and Cris

Be's what I please in brand new Bentleys
That's right stupid! Soon as they couped it, I went and scooped it
Now I'm on the move, on the move
Running the City, something like Diddy
At 150, wit the gun and the cd (wow!)
Niggaz who be hunting for biddies
Never seen nothing this pretty, and they lying if they say they do
They bring the playa through like they bring the mayor through
They know the way I do is what the AK'll do
Listen here we can disappear for a day or two
Bet you come back smiling like Mase, see'mon!

But the Top Dawg tell her it must be easy
I'm in the white cut E-Veezy

You see I bop to the beat of the streets since I was born
Move like they would in the hood until I'm gone
The girls know my paper denim, keep paper in em
As soon as they change the shapes I'm in em
The BAPEs they send em wit snake skin in em
To the kid in the city wit the scrapers in em
(Nowww!) I move to left like.. then I move to the right like
They follow the need to follow my lead
Do the do then swallow my seed, like
You can leave the spot you cramped in
Live in the Hamptons like a champion
Refuse to choose the, use the loser
Don't let the hydro moves confuse ya
And pass on a stunner to go wit a fronter
If you want to do the kick it then go wit a punter

I don't know what it be, baby girl could it be
You ain't see how good it be rolling wit me?
Like - get me on or get me gone
It's at least 22's that they sit me on
I'm in the Ice Cream shoes, nice gleam too
Crack the button up so the ice beam through
You could wake up wit regrets, or wake up in a jet
Fixing you hairdo in a Jacob wit baguettes girl

But pimp enough to not give a fuck
They say I'm old enough to know better
But young enough to not give a fuck
Tell Stella to move back, if she want Her Groove Back
I get my young man on, then the young man gone
Let's get money again, and even if you ain't
I'll make you feel twenty again, so!

This is way before a nigga brought grey plaques in
So if i spray mac-10s, Bet you niggas lay back then

Yea I made crack grins but ain't a damn thing funny

I keep it comin with bottles of champagne dunny
So keep it bouncin till you pull a hamstring honey

Call me bossan george, got a lotta hoes

And I gotta stack of singles in my hand that's phone booth thick

And get ridda that shit spitta, get wit her, shit gitter

Ma you better off coming with a Anna Nicole plan, tryna get ya hand on a old man
Maybe he's plannin' to romance, hand you a gold band and spend a couple grand on a po dance
...When it comes to splurgin chips, I'm tighter than virgin lips
If there's some who like to trick, who like a chick
And +come out the pocket like Michael Vick+
Or some who want a patient man
....or go with a payment plan
...wanna go to department stores
Then they want the keys to your apartment door
Nowadays a girl'll come with a price tag
And give it up for nice shoes and a nice bag

And I ain't thirst, but show em.....

I rather be single and swing alone
+before you do me like ginger did sam+
+they catch you if they can like the ginger bread man+
But I know it's all about the benjamins mam
And maybe another man responds to you
At the most I could get you in the ???

Actin' like what you do don't phase me, don't phase me
Meanwhile I'm sittin' at home, all alone
Tryin' to keep myself from goin' crazy
When I'm in the house, when I think about
When I see you out, when I hear about {T-Pain}
I want my baby back! {'Lo-so} And I thought it would be easy
But it's hard for me to let you GO~!
(Baby don't) GO! (Baby don't) go!
(Baby don't) go (baby don't) {y'all know what this is}

Now I'm better than your ex, gon' be better than your next
Baby Screwed Up so you better be from Tex-as
Can't seem to doubt that I creamed her out
Now you dream about how I turned Nieman out
Nothin' to scream about just back your Beemer out
Pack it up in the trunk, go back to Kima house
Cause I can play cool, but I can't play fool
There's options in break up, you ever play pool?
Better do you cause I damn sure does me
And what your buzz be is only because of me

The wifey, hus-by, never was me
I does me, trust me
I don't wanna another you so I'mma slide (yup)
But I got another boo, on the side, bay-bay

I try to play cool
Actin' like what you do don't phase me, don't phase me
Meanwhile I'm sittin' at home, all alone
Tryin' to keep myself from goin' crazy
When I'm in the house, when I think about

But it's hard for me to let you GO!
(Baby don't) GO! (Baby don't) go!
(Baby don't) go (baby don't)

Through the time I been alone, time I spent on phones
Know you ain't lettin' them climb up in my throne

Now, baby that lime with that Patron
Have me talkin' crazy, it's time to come on home
Now, I talk with someone above

It's okay to lose your pride over someone you love
Don't lose someone you love though over your pride
Stick with 'cha entree and get over your side

We break up to make up at Jacob's baby
Her parents fought too, I'm the makeup baby
Wake up baby, love 'll have you open though
I mean you seen Tom Cruise on the Oprah show
So I just can't bet on the next hand
There's too much in this pot just to give to the next man

I try to play cool
Actin' like what you do don't phase me, don't phase me
Meanwhile I'm sittin' at home, all alone
Tryin' to keep myself from goin' crazy
When I'm in the house, when I think about
When I see you out, when I hear about
I want my baby back! And I thought it would be easy
But it's hard for me to let you GO!
(Baby don't) GO! (Baby don't) go!
(Baby don't) go (baby don't)

Now if you ain't never went through it you ain't really into it
The next rap to show you I really been through it
Every other day I'm givin' the love away
That's what your friend's sister or little brother say
If I'mma do somethin', it's the undercover way
When them hatin ass watchdogs look the other way
And others may not see that we need each other
But if we on the same page we can read each other
They should learn us, instead of try to turn us
Mr. and Ms. Smith, we both got the burners - UP~!
If you love your baby then turn this up
Know we keep this hot like a Thermos cup
Relax, don't be Tryin' to perm us up
We already straight - yes

I try to play cool
Actin' like what you do don't phase me, don't phase me
Meanwhile I'm sittin' at home, all alone
Tryin' to keep myself from goin' crazy
When I'm in the house, when I think about

I want my baby back! And I thought it would be easy
But it's hard for me to let you GO!

I'm right here, big; ya boy sittin' on top like a hair wig, Benz style fly
Bush wick sick, East New York walk the Brownsville grill, ill
You see, I got a Fort Green lean, Clinton hill the chill red-hook look, man
Ain't no shook hands in Brooklyn; son, yo' life can get took, man 
And threw off bridges; one hard top, two soft bitches
Ride through the borough with two four fizez 
Phantom open up like two door fridges
I'm makin' change to New York digits from seven-one-eight to one-eight-seven
The two-one-two to two-one-one, ya boy's back
With a new one, son

I'm right here, Fab, wavin' the flag, comin' from Nostrand Ave.
I came to take the game in my Daddy Kane chain; niggas gave it up smooth
They ain't wanna hear the bang; bang, I'm back on my bully shit 
That flat bush, bush wick, black hoody shit 
Half a billi in the bankroll, bank stop anybody
Bank stop anybody - what you bank ho? Big B's on the wheels
Spread love the Brooklyn way; B, how's it feel?
I'm on my Robin Thicke shit; shit ever gets thick, back to robbin' niggas quick, trick, click
Ante up, all you niggas is Brittney - pull ya panties up 
Whole borough is wit' me, hold ya cannons up 
Buck one for Bucktown, Brooklyn; what the fuck?

[Chorus]

[Uncle Murda]
I'm right here, Hov
East New York, Uncle Murda feelin' good; I hooked up wit' jigga
Got my grandma out the hood; ROC is back, now look at niggas 
Now they can't say J ain't signed a Brooklyn nigga 
Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?
Shootin' somebody up, or gettin' off them packs, or go into the club
Lookin' for somethin' to cap or runnin' up in ya crib like, where the safe at?
East New York'll shoot ya; they'll gat ya, homey
Brownsville rob ya; they'll clap ya, homey
Benz style, I'll get you killed for a hundred grams
Get a Coney Island nigga to pull the trigga, man 
Ask Flex, he used to run the turf
Brookyln had dudes scared to rep their borough
Uncle Murda - I'm a rep to the fullest
Like shine in the club, I throw bullets, bullets

Ha ha, Clinton hill shill, red hook look, that flat bush push, know what I mean?

Square face watch look like sponge bob on the wrist
One white, one gold, one nice, untold
You could look, but don't touch, guns might unload, now
I respect them thugs who get they jackin' on
But we squeeze to every slug that we be packin', son
Ya boy got the drug money we be stackin' on
Lotta carrots, not the one's Bugs Bunny snackin' on

Oops, I mean Phantom; my words got tangled, man
But this tiger stripe watch make this bitch a Bengals fan
We all know Jacob; check the shit he did
He spent more time making the band than Diddy did

I'm out in DC at the white and gold house

Start inspectin' you without disrespectin' you

What you wearin' got me starin' like you butt-naked, boo
It may seem like I don't even reckon you
But I day dream about kissin' on the neck of you
Style is impeccable, smile is incredible
Ain't nothin' like ya, and, baby, I done met a few you
The way I feel - it's almost like crush (crush)
My heart beats faster - it's almost like a rush (rush)

No rush, though, I spent the whole November waitin'
Come on, look at the patience that I'm demonstratin'
After a week or two I usually start eliminatin'
But we got through the convo on the phone 
Now we finally chillin' on a condo all alone 
I tried to be expressive without bein' aggressive
Just bein' suggestive, a lil' more impressive 
And I'm a good player: I listen to the coach 
He show me the play book, and said this is the approach
If you ever wanna score, 'cause some players rush they shots
And that's why they never on the floor 
And that's why we both feelin' comfortable

Funnier than Dane Cook, you hit the Sufi
I am to fly, in the booth I
Make joke of them, I ain't the richest nigga but I ain't broke as them
I'm serious, petty worth will make a man delirious like Eddie Murph
Girls get curious
Is he really funny, don't be silly honey
I'm the burner packing
Bernie macing
I ain't scared of you ma-fuckers kick ass
Hon stack thick ass
A deck of card v.i.p. section hard
They try to holla at me you know the heckler broads
I'm popping rose, I don't the neck to god
Don't front yo, I be in the front row
Watch your wise cracks or I'll be at your front door
And I push up on a female smoothly, in a GL but keep that on the D.L. Hughley
Lol this is Los
Oh no your money coming so slow guess this ma-fuckers a no show, oh oh oh

You plus me - it equal better math
Ya boy a good look, but she my better half
I'm already bossin', already flossin'
But why I have the cake if it ain't got the sweet frostin'? (Yep, yep, yep, yep)
You're keepin' me on my A-game (what, what, what, what)
Without havin' the same name (that, that, that, that, that)
They may flame (but, but, but, but)
But, shawty, we burn it up
The sag in my swag, pep in my step
Daddy do the Gucci, mami in Giuseppe's
Guess it's a G thing, whenever we swing
I'm a need Coretta Scott if I'm gonna be king

But if I'm a star, she is the sky (ah, ah, ah)
And when I feel like I'm on top (she, she, she)
She give me reason to not stop (eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
And though I'm hot (to, to, to)
Together, we burn it up

The caked-up cut, the cleaned-up ice
When shawty come around, I clean up nice
Dynamic duo - Batman and Robin
Whoever don't like it, it's that man problem (eh, eh, eh)
And when I feel like I'm tired (ma, ma, ma)
Mami be takin' me higher (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

Inside every great man you can find a woman, like a soldier, holdin' him down

And she treats me like a Don, watches for the hit
Checks where I go, even watches who I'm with
The right when I'm wrong, so I never slip
Show me how to move, that's why I never trip
And, baby girl, you so major they should front-page ya (front-page ya)
God bless the parents who made ya (who made ya)

Hey, shorty, we can do it real playa like
We can go a few places that you say you like

You need to leave them burgers alone and make a steak upgrade
I'm fillet mignon with a tape-up fade
I see things clear through these Mark Jacob shades
Like the clarity in these jewels that Jacob made
You sleep better knowin' you gon' wake up paid
Hairstyled, nails filed, makeup made
We can shock South Beach, shake up Dade
In a drop top Phantom with the Drakov blades
I'm a stop by the barber; you can hit the shops in the harbor
Then get the chops or the lobster
Prime on twelve, dinner for dos
We begin with a toast, end with a dose
Of the light green cheeba, rolled in a cohiba
It's Sunday, so you know the Forge is
Weather gorgeous, not a cloud in the sky
We can show the world how to be fly, yes

If you want to act Hollywood, fine; but, shorty, let's do it
When we sittin' on the hills like the Hollywood sign
And every man lies, but not every man flies
Privately to Van Nuys
Range on the runway, driver to pop doors
Straight to Barney's, somethin' we need to stop for
She like, ""It's early, what we gonna shop for?""
How 'bout green grass breakfast, top floor
Later on Fred C, or Max Fields
Real playa like dress, good black heels
No 'Hanas, we can do Katana's
You, me, and ooo-wee marijuana
Then slide through Hyde, might include Mood
Maybe go to Area, if it's in the area
The Friday's young, try things my way, hun
Malibu ride, highway one

Nothing is too much, everything you touch turns to gold
You make me better (you make me better)

I can't help but notice I'm more focused (but you're the coldest)
Girl, you are so...

Hey, shorty
Bring the Maybach, we got a long way to go
Just lay back; you had a long day, I know
And they whack, do it the wrong way, I know
I play back but have the song playin' low
While we six-deuce and let you fix Goose
In a glass with some ice, maybe mix juice in
On the way to L.I., well I, could a took the hell-eye
But we do more behind wheel
Hampton home, two floors, for nine mill'
Real playa like, two doors from Seinfeld
White marble, new floors that shine still
And the help keep food stored, wine chilled
Hey, you gotta live one day, right? (Right)
Well, how 'bout from Friday to Sunday night?
Then back 'fore they notice back up in Lotus
Let the world know we back and we focused

Posing us can't be wise
Swept across the family dies
Something small as a look, can bring about a man's demise
And whoever he stands beside, hit him where he can't survive
Throw the drop, or slip an object, if not then missing
Nine shot, pop a clip in, pine box the opposition
Put him in formal dress, right hand across the left
No autopsy necessary, determined the cause of death
Six shots across the chest should explain his loss of breath
Skin peeled off your flesh, I know you wish you wore a vest
That's a no brainer, I'm coming with both flamers
I'll spray 'em, but I'm no painter
To this here, I'm no stranger
It's obvious you no bangers
You dudes pose no danger
Your whole crew chumps, in the closet like coat hangers
Like purple broke up in the dutch
Leave you broke up on a crush
That's what happens when shooters choke up in the clutch
We gonna body you, and have to hook your wife to an I.V. too
Put both of your parents side by side in I.C.U (everybody lose)

Dear Fab
I wrote this letter in confidence you will read it
I succeeded getting my college education completed
Smart girl, not conceited, but used to being treated any way
But anyway, your advice is needed
I'm twenty-two years old with a beautiful daughter
By a dead beat who wouldn't give a quarter to support her
My money was gettin' low, and my patience was getting shorter
Heard about his new girlfriend and all the shit he bought her
So I caught, fought her, heard she had restraining orders
I still grabbed her pony tail and held her under water
So right now I'm sorta locked up for manslaughter
Missing every minute I can't spend with my daughter

[Chorus]

Lo-so
I know you hold profession as a lyricist
But you probably never had depression as severe as this
Your music - it's like a session with a therapist
I asked the Lord to send me any blessin' if he's hearin' this
I'm stressin' somethin' serious, pressin' on delirious
A smart man always asks questions if he's curious
I believe in God, but I don't understand his plan
Why send a Spanish man way up to Afghanistan?
Hand this man a rifle, suit me up in camouflage
I salute the hand of Sarge; he is not a man in charge
I'm fightin' this war, don't know who I'm fightin' it for
Might be goin' AWOL any day, y'all

I'm such a fan, I don't have much demands
But I'm really hopin' that you will keep in touch with fans
'Cause see, I know you're probably busy kickin' 
With one of them pretty girls from on television shaking it
My vision ain't mistaken, I can see you wasn't faking
So I hope that you can help me with some good decision making
I've been thinkin' lot, so much I haven't slept in days
My mother and father about to go they separate ways
I'm a teen in the cross of a painful divorce
I love my mom, and she thinks I'm an angel, of course
I love my dad, too; I feel tangled and lost
Who's side should I be on?
Your friend, Deon

[Chorus]

Yeah, this song is dedicated to anyone who find they self in a place where they need some advice
You may not always find that person in the physical form, but there's someone you can trust in
Who listens when everybody's ears are shut, who sees when everybody's eyes are closed
Who speaks when everybody's voice is silent
Put your faith in god; the man will take you from there

For you niggas in the way we can let the guns say ""excuse you""
At the end of the day we just trying find our way and I might be a come up
And baby you hitch a ride but u gotta know how to do more than how to keep a thump up
It's so incredible that it ain't edible but they know the cake's real
Yo I couldn't even say ask these other silicon niggas how being fake feel

[Chorus]
Everyday is my day I'ma do it my way everyday
Everything about me, what they love about me everything
Everywhere that I be, feel VIP baby
And everybody's cool, but y'all just ain't me

Somebody better tell em that we in this bitch like an unborn baby
See we be everywhere, and they ain't never there, couldn't tell you where they be
And you already know you ain't gotta ask me you can see that everything is up
And I'm so bout my money you ain't talking about no money you ain't even gotta bring it up
And I hope you don't think me give a sugar honey iced tea or a middle finger up
I just stay sucker-free, leave the lames where they be, and I let my chips pringle up
Everybody calm down, there's enough to go around, you just gotta say how much you want
Don't know what you're looking for, unless it's a problem, I promise this ain't what you want

[Chorus]

Can you do me this favor, answer this question, y'all gon try who
See the shoes by Gucci, bag by Louie, the hating'll be by you
And I appreciate the love, thank the man above cause a nigga feel so blessed
And I ain't gonna stop, better get them red bulls, I don't give these haters no rest

[Chorus]","Everything, Everyday, Everywhere"
Fabolous,"I introduce you to the life
You need the life, the life needs you
Everything is nice

Let me welcome you to my world
Everything's in living color plus the fly girls
On the way and gotta watch them with a keen eye
Niggas ain't seen fly till they seen I
Maybach cause I'm not a limousine guy
Suit with the bow tie no bean pies
The Laperle match well with these Feragamis
Killer shoe game these are just a pair of hamies
Mommy I get up like QB's
Na, she ain't stepped in blood, those are Lou B's
We don't follow, unless you lead us into VIP
When they know your face, they don't need to see ID
I can see the bottles coming from a mile away
Sparklers on the top act like they don't know to stop (stop, stop)
She fuck with niggas like Fabolous
Cause to tell the truth, baby life's fabolous

It's the fabulous life, oh I be living that
Oh I be living that, oh I be living that
Get your money right, you could be living that
You could be living that, you could be living that
It's a fabulous life, oh I be living that
Oh I be living that, oh I be living that
How you living, what? How you living, what?
How you living, oh I be living fabulous

I bow my head and I praise that
We be there and back before the Rose's flat
Picture me anywhere a clown stays at
I don't think so, homey don't play that
Everything is BOSS, like a Rick ad-lib
Take it to house like it's Trick Dad Crib
We hit Miami like a hurricane
Shorty poolside, one piece Veroaine
She the baddest bitch in them Jackie O shades
Flabby beach mat, she don't give me no shade
Hold the heat down, she don't even know Wade
Nigga get smoked like cigarette tote
I like her soft kiss and I dig her wet throat
I love her booty bounce like cigarette boats
And it won't quit
She can't wear skinny jeans cause her ass don't fit
Real shit

It's the fabulous life, oh I be living that
Oh I be living that, oh I be living that
Get your money right, you can be living that
You can be living that, you can be living that
It's a fabulous life, oh I be living that
Oh I be living that, oh I be living that
How you living, what? How you living, what?
How you living, oh I be living fabulous

Got a rich bitch on the way
That for real though, just like Wanda say
She just wanna rock my world in the Wonder way
I'm sitting at the airport like Andele
Fist I saw the Luggy with the Louie monogram
Then I saw my baby like a sonogram
On the runway, just me and Bentley
I open doors, you ain't gotta G the gent me
I was thinking Knicks game, court side
She put her hands in my pants, I let that thought slide
We can get it on, but there's no leg room
No water bed, just a boat with a bedroom
Now you tell me who can top this
Hey, laying on the deck topless
Got two different dames, it's a Fabolous thing
One white, one yellow, like Fabolous chain

It's the fabulous life, oh I be living that
Oh I be living that, oh I be living that
Get your money right, you could be living that
You could be living that, you could be living that

On the courthouse steps after they throw it out
Bentley waiting by the curb I spur it out
Doors don't open they self the chauffeur get out
My exhale made anything a foggy blur
I make my way through the reporters and photographers
I take my lady's hand I shake my attorney's
Slide in the back seat and let's begin this journey
Told the driver hold off before we pushed out
I let my window down and out comes a kush cloud
Any last words?
Justice has been served
Now back to the streets that's what the hustlers deserve

We rubber band the money we black glove the glock
I'm screamin' free at last free at last
She used to send me pictures so I could see that ass
That's real talk that's a real bitch
Fly as I left the minx still fit
They know my name but in case they didn't know so
Appear in a casket courtesy of loso
So you should have your shit packed
I'm a need ya to not be here when I get back

If they ain't talkin' money I'm out my business then
If that ain't what it is then what is it then?
I'm out here grizzyin' swizzyin'
It's me bitches sittin' in a phantom
Got the streets back but I didn't pay the ransom
My father who fathered you treat you like my grandson

Fabolous,"I mean, I don't even know where to start like. 
It's like you find love, and you loose love, and then

Met her up town on dykeman
Aight then
Light skinned
Starring with a slight grin, I don't know, Might been
Cause I'm in this white Benz

Or the way the Ice in the Brietling flash brighter than a lightning
But I knew from right then
She was 'bout her money, and how she fit right in knowing how I might spend.
To make a story short, other than a Tight End
Had a Washington Heights friend
Who bring that white in.
Set up a meeting, Her dude caught a flight in
Sat down at Sole, popped a bottle of white then
Got straight to business like two corporate white men
The food came, before I could take a bite in
He said ""You the type I usually don't invite in, 
But since we got a like friend I could get you like, 10""
I told him I could move like 10 by nights end
Put the white over the plate, like I'm throwing strikes in.

'El Duke' got a dude in the UK, Buy 5 bricks at a time, $22 K

He send the Euro's I send the Puredo
Now that's what I like to call a ""Foreign Exchange""
He smiled. Duke finished his glass of wine
There's a van outside, pull your S-Class behind
My man will pass a dime, at 15 a pop
Tell shorty ""Make the drop, Don't make no stops!""
I gave him a hand shake some dollars for the tab
Told shorty the location then I holla'd for a cab

I hit mike told 'em ""Send the wire to the buyers""
Word got 'round like we were handin' out flyers!

And them things went as quick as they came
I'm back being a hustler, this chick is to blame

And them things went as quick as they came
I'm back being a hustler, this chick is to blame

Twelve months in, turned a Benz to a Lambo
Everywhere the fam go, korks fly, Champ Flow
I gotta celebrate, that's the way I am yo
In the past week I watched fifty thousand grams go
Pocket full of money, Army full of Rambo's
Trunk full of bricks, Hand guns full Ammo

Even got detectives if somethin' goes wrong
The money's so strong they see it from my perspective
But with my shorty, A nigga's so protective-
And should be, she's the one who knows where the connect lives.
She don't talk much, real calm and collective
Seen something in me 'cause shorty's really selective.

I tell'er fall back, shorty stilla drive
Said the rush of the risk just makes her feel alive
I listen to her fuss, saying ""that I must, let her do it 
Cause they're aint too many niggas that I trust""

So now time is flyin', I been kinda eyeing
A ring for my queen who got me diamond buying

I'm in the G-T headed up to C-T, 
Lookin' for a stone to light her finger like E-T
I got there, and got a call from a D-T (detective)
Sounded nervous saying ""we need to talk now""
I told em chill out, I ain't in new york now
Any problems I got, get traced in chalk now!

But when I get back, we can sit and chit chat
Better not be no bull shit, I ain't even wit that

Back to what a nigga came out here for
This 5ct. Diamond without near flaw's

Head back to the city, call up the committee
Get ready for tomorrow, they're comin' in with fifty
I almost forgot, I gotta see a cop
I figured it was a drop who must ain't get his gwop

He told me meet him by the bridge, I get there in a hurry
Got me worried and it's probably just a minor mix up
He said: ""Nah Los, FED's dun snatched ya chick up
Caught her at a pick up, scoopin' those bricks up! 
She gon' cooperate, and ya fixed up. 
She's probably at the headquarters now hangin' flix up""

I asked him ""Was he sure""
Shorty's ""Mi Amore""
This happened to me before, with my man Diadore
Over a Ki(lo) of raw
My nigga got killed, caps got peeled and I still got guilt.
He assured me, I was hot- she had put 'em on me
Swore to Jesus' Tears that he was here to warn me.

Normally, I would have just ended her life-
But this was the girl I intended to wife

So I went home to shorty, had trouble sleepin'
Shorty's kinda peepin my sudden discomfort
She woke up mad early, so I got up with her
She wanted to go alone, but a nigga insisted
Like ""Baby it's been a while"" and truthfully I missed it

We rode out, but she don't know that I done made a plan
Once she hits the spot, one shot, see you later man

I watched her in the building,
Knowing it's the last time-seein' her ass climb in and out of the car
Yo I even thought about gettin' out of the car
But sat back lookin' at the ring about to be y'all's

I let one tear fall at an unfair call
Ya whole life can change in just one year y'all
Caught in a thought, then I heard a

Hi love, bye love, I will miss my love.

It's so crazy how it happened like
It's just
Crazy

It's just crazy you know? Just the way it happened it's just

Yo everything ain't love, love cause if it is
My definition of love must differ his
I mean every friendship has its differences
But these 'Young Bucks' remind me of 'Fif' and his
They hear the good life, wanna see what the difference is
Some just wanna smoke, enjoy the piff-vileges
He unwrap a cigar like it's a gift of his
He a funny lil nigga like Eddie Griffin is
Between smokin' and chokin' then you got to live
So I gave him a chance and that's a lot to give
We 'posed to make the most of what you was paid to gross
I gave you bread and butter you supposed to make the toast
Fifteen years, fifteen years
And now when we say 'what's up' the shit seem weird
But there's a question I prepared for you
How could you fuck the only people who ever cared for you?

Had a crush on you now we Kim and Cease
We don't even talk no more it's no biggie
I was so Biggie, you was Faith
I let you slide in my home, you was safe
I thought my ability to provide you stability
Was what was really G, okay silly me
I was Billy D, smooth cappa really street
Really she attract niggaz like the a Milli beat
And I happen to rap but somethin' 'bout this beat strange
Soon as I try to flow with it the beat change
Never thought she'd change
But what you thinks a upgrade really just could be a seat change

I miss the cool nights sittin in the Coll-O
Now it's like boo we sittin' in Apollo
It used to be all good then shit just went mile low
And that's bad, matter fact that's sad
Cause when you lose a friend it's hard to handle the loss
They do some bitch shit gotta give ya man a divorce
End up watchin' Friends like Joey, Chandler and Ross, ya see
Most of these niggas ain't never love 'em

I've got some things to say, oh
Please don't go, oh
So don't you turn away, oh
Please don't go, oh
I need you here to stay, I
Miss you so

My daddy left me, and he ain't even die
So when he did go, I ain't even cry
I had reason, but that ain't even why
How could he have failed if he ain't even try
I ask no questions, I ain't even pry
Truthfully I wanted to I can't even lie
Like a canceled flight, that ain't even fly
To just walk away, like you ain't even my
Like, like, like I ain't even your
I cant even say it, I ain't even sure
He shoulda gave me everything and left me even more
But he left me without saying what he was leavin' for
And that's when I became a man
And that's the day he stopped bein' one
This year I became a father
And I'm a die bein' one, whats up son

I have nightmares of me not bein' round
He took his first steps and daddy couldn't be in town
Daddy's entertaining everybody
But missed out when it came to trainin' for the potty
I give a fuck about hip-hops new beef
I was more excited when my son grew teeth
So I same the problem
Of the famous stardom
Just like Em and Haily
Just like Game and Harlem
Weezy's at the awards with Miss. Carter
Nah not his date, i'm talkin' bout his daughter
Now that's stuntin' like your daddy
Cause its crazy when you wanna be nothin' like your daddy
And if you never been a man
That's the day you start bein' one
This year I became a father
And I'm a die bein' one, whats up son

So hear the truth remain to let me go
I wont hold that against you, I moved on
Just look what I become since you been gone
Now don't you turn away, oh, please don't go
Here's what I got to say, oh
Please don't go
oh why'd you go away, oh
Please don't go
I needed you here to stay, oh

I cant believe this day, oh

You'll end up down under tryna holla at Koalas

Somebody talk to me, muthafuck rappin
They infiltrated the game, but who let in the pookies?
Kingpins is snitchin' that shit is not lookey
So fuck new friends unless they stay solo
Cause who gon' watch you back after you kill Manolo?
Isn't it ironic Santana's own fella stabbed him

Money's what you can count on when your friends ain't
Grass green over here
Green like the kush's
I got presidents in my jeans like the Bushes
We don't chase money 
we chase dreams
Rub this money in your face, face cream
Doctors say I have a problem
I see nothing but the bread
Told me close my eyes ""what you see""
Y'all know what I said!

And if I go make sure the family gets the cash
And at my funeral there's only one wish I ask
Give the haters a chance to see me cause this they last
Turn me over one by one let them kiss my ass

Pocket full of ego, big head people
One two three body count rising
Now everybody got their hand out fucking Heisman
Your boy just convinced her that she gorgeous
Must have took a couple thousand of them Georges
They call me funeral they call us broad'trish
Face on point they should call us swordfish
He got a gang of money

He in the blue six screaming out, stop it five
Black out jewelry, you still see it though

When you talking to a pro watch ya mouth rookie
Go in ya shit have ya teeth playin' mouth hookie
Nice, you niggas must of heard me wrong.
I blame them horses when I turn that Porsche turby on (vrrm)
My engine gettin' his Kentucky derby on,
Seats is brunette paint is dirty blond
Speaking of dirty blond's
Say hi to curvy Don Fergie John
With the body movement of a turbion
I just watch her, 
It's been a hectic year 
So I sit and get fried
Call the weed electric chair
But y'all on death row, one request left
You looking for ya girl oh she just left
Her and my dick just became B.F.F's
Then I threw her out like jazzy J. E.F.F

You dicks belong in latex not tape decks
You can't see me
Neither can the flunkies under you
My shit bananas, like a monkey number two
I'm bigger than that
More like guerrilla though
Nick name funeral got that from this killer flow.
Er'thing still a go, my pockets be extra fat
Big money on deck like A Rods next to bat

I'm a big deal like a contract from bad boy

My swag plays a big part so it's all gravy

Pretty mixed bitch I just call ha P.M.B
Watch ya step baby gettin' out that G.M.C
You bust yo ass girl we both gon' be on T.M.Z
Don't be shy let them cameras expose you
The worst that can happen is I Amber Rose you
People running up like damn I knows you
Hey ain't you? Yeah I am that bitch
Six feet deep nigga, yeah I am that ditch.
Throw it in the bag in a recession, I am that rich

Keep that bitch cummin' like blaka blaka

You ain't gotta worry bout her, shorty straight
Been chasing her for two days, first forty eight
A bad bitch cost, she worth every cent
She look like the best money that I ever spent
Just watching my cutie pie get beautified
Make me want better jewels, a newer ride
Louis Vuitton shoes, she got too much pride
Her feet are killing her, I call it shoe'icide
Looking good has it's sacrifices
Chilly weather bring four figure jacket prices
Her body nice, face dime
Give you that iPhone four, face time
Shorty in the streets, still handle the home
Enough class for wine, still handle Patron
When them other hos call I hand her the phone
And she hand 'em the tone

You what's up girl, ain't gotta ask it
I dead 'em all now, I buy the caskets
They should arrest you or whoever dressed you
Ain't gon' stress you, but I'm a let you know

Yeah I know that's what they all says
She gotta donkey with her, Juan Valdez
Keep it clean cut like bald heads
Been playin' with that green long as Paul Pierce
So you gotta ball harder than them ball players
All she wanna know is there a mall near us
Can't fault her, the last nigga spoiled her
But he ain't beat it up, I assault her
Shoulda seen her come to me when I called her
Slow strut like she walking to the altar
Hand bag on her arm cost four bills
And she ain't gotta beg, borrow or steal
Often imitated, never duplicated
They say she a dime, I say she underrated
I just met her so the next solution
Dead my old chick, execution

You what's up girl, ain't gotta ask it
I dead 'em all now, I buy the caskets
They should arrest you or whoever dressed you
Ain't gon' stress you, but I'm a let you know

In a fitted cap and some Timbo's

My head is in the cloud 
Felt like it just took a flight up
They tryin' to slow me down like that sizzurp in them white cups

Those old niggas trying to live off their old bodies
These young niggas think they killing shit, they nobodies

Reservations to eat and you my dinner guest
Shawty clean up nice, never been a mess
Could take a little pain, I see them tattoos in her flesh
But I ain't try to hurt her, ‘cause I've always been the best
At making my shawty feel it till she feel it in her chest
Sex excellent, get a hundred when I test
I'm a fan of her talent, so I've always been impressed
Sex in the city on my black satin sheets
Wet as Hurricane Sandy on the Manhattan streets
Lit a few candles like my power hadn't reached
Then I took you places that her last nigga hadn't reached
Bitch so bad know her parents went through hell
Smart mouth when we argue, you would swear she went to Yale
I wanna touch her, not using my hands
Make her dance without using the bands

Call me crazy, shit at least you call me
Feels better when you let it out, don't it, boy?
Know its easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it 'cause you're mad and you take it all back
Then we fuck all night till things get right
Then we fuck all night till things get right

The club popping but she ain't trying go there
Her friends know where she going every time she tell them “nowhere”
I'm the only one that get up in that VIP
My money grown, baby, ain't no need to see id
Slide her somethin' just to come through, host money
At least niggas know you're getting to the most money
Club my place, you wear what you wanna wear
But you're overdressed if you're wearing underwear
Now turn up, couple J's to burn up
Couple spots to hide out, now let that playlist ride out
Where I live on Sunday, your place Monday
Her hand in my pants, call that Al Bundy
Pull it out like a pistol yo, kissin' on the balls like the dick a mistletoe
Tell her do the thing I like, best she listen, yo
Bad bitch good girl around the Christmas, though (Nice)

Pussy sweeter than some fresh fruit
She gushin' I drink the best juice
I'm drinking till nothing left too
And she playing with herself, too
I been thinking about her all day
She perform like it's Broadway
Yeah, we hop in the range, she off top with the brain
Got the windows down, broad day
Just look at her, spectacular
Throw her on the stove, flip her like a spatula
Other niggas want her, but you see them niggas whack to her
Side bitch tripping ‘cause I don't ever get back to her
My bitch like bitches, but none of my bitches bad to her
She's a trigger, I never seen her with a bad bitch
Unless she's meeting on these other bitches average
Hundred percent real all these bitches is plastic
Moroccan goddess, she walk like she need her ass kissed
Walk like she need her ass kissed
Diced pineapples, super fine at you
If she's giving head, She's throwing her mind at you
Fuck these other bitches, nigga, she don't mind that you do
Might just wanna watch, I ain't taking time at you, dudes
Never faking, why they hella front?
Keep it real with her, yeah, that's all she ever wants
Somethin' bout the alchemy, she don't ever disappoint
London on the balcony, we 'bout to smoke another joint
Miami on the yacht, she pulling on my pistol saying how she love my cock
Metaphoric bliss, shawty, you the shit
Couple days with her, man, that's all I ever get
Yeah she got a little sister, that's all she ever with
Game like a nigga, man, that's wall she ever spit
Montreal was our first time, swear pussy just like the first lines
Scars on my back, she don' left couple there
spent a couple stacks, I don' put a couple pair
Try to bag mine, my nigga I double dare
Never retract statements, nigga, I'm never scared
Niggas be switching up, but nigga, I'm never weird
Back on another leer
I leave niggas here, all in another year
All in another lane, all in another gear
All of you niggas lame, all of your niggas here
Listen up, bitch niggas bitching up
I guess you're doing what you're supposed to
Let a real nigga hold you
Back to my baby girl, though, I just need you in my world, yo

South beach, spent time there, off shores my time wear
Whole crew got they own watch, nigga we ain’t buying no time shares
The lifestyle, too fly, my new bitch is getting next flighted
I'd say I'm back to the old me, but my old bitches would get excited
Ain’t going back, I’m stepping forward, don’t test me, been prepping for it
Got no time for that hating shit, my young niggas got weapons for it
Got Chief Keefs that ain’t Chop, that bang-bang, that blocker
And all you niggas is blockers, change your name to Ibaka
Shit real, shit been real and shit just get realer
I’m showing bitches my car keys then ask them what’s the dealer
Ain’t saying that’s your girl, ain’t saying shit like prank callers
'Cause it’s a small world and hoes make it even smaller

It’s the life, the life, the life is so exciting
The life, the life, the life is so exciting
The life, the life, the life is so exciting
The life, the life, the life is so exciting

It’s beach weather over here, nigga, sky’s clear, nigga
That’s flip flops, that’s Americana, that’s Hilfiger
Yacht masters at the yacht party, sitting at the dock is a drop 'rari
That’s pole position with a joystick, that’s push a button that’s like Atari
Raising the bar, no parallel, so many horses, carousel
How we roll out like a caravan, ghost in the snow, see Carol Ann
Maryland, tags on it, heroine, bags on it
Hermes, throw pillows, Missoni couch and it clash on it
Take a look in my viewfinder and see seven figures and two commas
I see bad bitches, see blue diamonds, I see-saws, I two time em'
Gigolo, juggle hoes, jigsaw, I puzzle those
Cross words, cross birds, I cross country with a couple those

It’s the life, the life, the life is so exciting

The life, the life, the life is so exciting

When the sun is out we runs about
Let the world see what these hunneds' about
Ain’t seen this since the one was out
With Jay, Pimp C, and Bun
We out here, still pimping that big
Looking that jig, someone go call hype Willie
We need slow mo, more rolls more
Niggas is drunk and type silly
We dancing like Dame, holding up chains
Got PMBs on a big ass boat on molly, rolling up Jane
This life is so exciting, that money be so inviting
So fuck what they're indicting, tell my lawyers keep on fighting

For the life, the life, the life is so exciting

Good times like J.J. and them
It was G.O.O.D Music like Kanye and them
It was Goodfellas like Henry and them
But nowadays good girls, ain't too many of them
So if you a good girl, let me see your hands
Let these niggas know, every chance that you can
If you got that good good
Shorty, please raise your hand
She know its all good, she just need a good man
If you smokin' good-good, nigga pass it to your man
'Cause when you at your lowest gettin' higher is the plan
Got somethin' in my cup, feel good to be the man
And if its good money, tell em' to put it in my hand

Talking good dudes, good vibes and some good food
Smokin' good with a playlist full of good grooves
You know the shit you like to hear, like good news
A couple Megan Goods came through, made the hood move
And slow motion for me, she be frontin' like
Why all this commotion for me
They talk about her shit, like they doing promotion for it
But she single, cause they never show devotion for it
She ain't never act too good for a nigga
But she losing faith, she don't see no good in these niggas
She like why I get treated bad, but be good to a nigga
You do bad, you lose, too bad, good for you nigga

It was good times like J.J. and them
It was G.O.O.D Music like Kanye and them
It was Goodfellas like Henry and them

She went Cee-lo with my Goodie Mob
Yellin' that I fall better, life is a gamble
I was good luck for the betters
Take a risk nigga, you gotta shoot to miss nigga
Time is golden, like that Rollie on your wrist nigga
I hate when they gets figures, then disfigured
And when niggas get salty and thinking that shits sugar
That's why good goes bad
That's when niggas who just came home, could go back
So let's keep the vibe right, keep the energy good
Them boys would sit you down player, like a injury would
Then my niggas fuck with me, before the Industry would
Riding till the wheels fall off and the engine no good

Look I wanna take y'all back to 7th grade, middle school
Skinny kid that everybody knew
I was a lil' cool
Had my intial ring, gold chain, my lil' jewels
What was more than most had so I never got ridiculed
This was '89, matter fact it was '90
Crack was already huge, the streets start getting grimey
But I wasn't in that world then
I'm 13, all I'm thinkin' bout is Nike's, basketball and my girlfriend
Yeah, who at the time was Tia Williams
And she had no idea that one day I would see a million
This is a teengae love, few months but we was buildin'
She was grown, I was the man but we was children
She had ass though, I mean for her age or whatever
She wore my ring some times like we engaged or whatever
And this the ""No, you hang up first"" dial tone era
Your mom's pick up and say ""Hang up my house phone"" era
And I hated that, how you gon' scream in my baby ear
That pretty lil' brown skin girl with the baby hair
As we was going steady, my sex drive was so Andretti
She a virgin but I feel like it's time, I know she ready
He ain't got much experience, but she don't know that
That boy's chance is coming up, I hope he don't blow that
I'm waiting for the opportunity, mama at work
Start with a kiss, then I'm in her shirt, next I'm in her skirt
You know that always heard that the first time gonna hurt
That's what she heard from her cousin, 'lied and told her it doesn't
And so to me, it's just a matter of time
That Tia gon' give it up to me and that'll be mine
But one day I was absent, I came back to school
Learned that, I left the man but I came back the fool
They said that ""Tia did some bullshit, I mean did y'all speak?""
She cut school, lost her virginity, some kid named Khalif
An I'm stuck... Like what the fuck?
I ain't hear that my girl did what?
But had to act like I ain't care
Felt like I wanted to cry, but nah I ain't tear
That first time I learned that trust ain't a must if I ain't there
And of course we broke up, she moved on, I did the same
I ended up with some next girl, forget her name
Which probably isn't right, cause we used to get along
But I remember Tia, cause she did me wrong

Back before a nigga went cold
Back before a nigga sold his soul
The grass is way greener, on the other side
The cash is way greener, over here where I reside
Soon as the summer come around I'm gon' make sure you see me
Said I'ma make sure you see me
But for now

Shouldn't you be
Gone
Gone for the winter

Straight up shit is real and any day could be your last in the jungle
My ears to the streets, I hear your ass when you mumble
They say you can't do it cause the last nigga fumble
As soon as you make it out, you get asked to be humble, waah
Head high, middle finger higher
My youngin' don't rap but that little nigga fire
Like Ray Allen in game 6, when James missed
Then Bosh tapped it to him
You know what had happened to 'em, swish
It's all about a swish
Know a nigga who would, you ain't even gotta wish
It's more in the sea and I done had a lot of fish
How she act when you ain't up will tell a lot about a bitch
Cause eagles don't fly with pigeons, they way higher
All wings flap but you gotta stay flyer
Niggas broke as a joke, sitting laughin' together
I started cheesin' after I turned my craft into chedder
I ran from the worst, chasing after the better
Life is a bitch, I knew right after I met her
So what you have-nots know about having knots?
Love for a hater only thing I haven't got

Kings don't speak English we speak Kinglish
I scoop a chick from Queensbridge, she coming back a Queen bitch
Think BIG and Kim, not think bigger than them
Everybody wanna shine, gotta give these niggas a gym
Never stressed of lil' things, like a hater
That's something that comes when you eatin', like a waiter
Live from the 718
It's the kid that always get the shoes early, I never run late
You see I big up the flows, everyword is capital
I killed all them hoes, I'm the murder capital
I'm the name they bring up that they think their bird is flappin' to
You the name that usually comes behind, ""word what happened to""

All I got is click-clack
Put it to your mouth just like Cutti did to Anthony
I tried to a friend mother fucker, you under handed me
Lucky this is personal and God got a plan for me
Cause I handle my business, never let my business handle me
Saying your name could do more for you than it can for me
You give niggas and they forget your philanthropy
You don't have a penny till your name Anfernee
Don't ever bite the hand that feed you and then stick out your hand for me
We don't base, we throw niggas in the truck for real
Chase you out the hood, make you live with uncle Phil
Champagne every night, I done drunk a mil
Yeah, now that's money wasted
But now it's kinda hard for me to buy Ace
'Specially when I just seen Hov buy Ace
Moves, time to make moves
No more jab steps, those is fake moves
Gotta make it happen, no time for what may work
My plan B's another way to make my plan A work
I dot the job myself and I'm still boss
You was in a win-win and you still lost

See the world as constipated, nobody gon' give you shit
I learned that niggas gon be niggas, yeah we shouldn't do it
But hoes gon' be hoes, they just ain't admitting to it
Where I been? Gettin to it, goin' through and gettin' through it
Running round killin' shit and tellin' cops, ""I didn't do it""
That's why they call me ""Young OG""
And I'ma spit this dope shit until my tongue OD
I flew my shorty in from Cali and she brung OG
She got me chillin' in my city but my lungs OT, yeah
And fuck them niggas online, reply why
Broke niggas talkin', cause it's free wifi

Troubled tears, they'll land you there
Open your eyes it's all a disguise
The fear that you feel, is not real, not real
The fear that you feel, is not real, no
Similar sky, similar ties
But I know all about you, I do

My son gon' be a king, I tell him every morning
I put my chain on his neck, right now it's heavy on him
One day it'll all be his, so I'm forever on him
I test him all the time and I never warn him
I pop quiz him like stop listenin' and drop wiz em
Pops vision; the bottoms crowded, the top isn't
We talk guap missions, cops prison
I help him see it clearly, I'm his life optician
Could learn from my experience but youngin' gotta live
Not with that mentality, that something gotta give
Cause that how we grew up, probably should of picked for boogers
Nah we was on them streets, juggin for that mugger
Still, scared that you could get killed
That fear that you feel, was that real
But I'm there like, I will not get killed
So that fear that I feel, is not real boy
I'ma true King, tryna raise a new king
I wanna show him stuff , how to do things
How to ride a bike, how to tie shoe strings
How to be a man, how to treat his boo thing
Gotta have a OG, to give you that ""Go 'head""
I don't blame you niggas, I blame your old head
I know all about that, my Poppa wasn't down
Poppa used to come through, Poppa doesn't now
Shoulda' protected me, but Poppa wasn't 'round
So now I got this 9, that pop-a-dozen round
Them kids grow up quick, usually grow you up too
Turn you to a big dog, that's what having pups do
Did a lot, but I know I ain't done yet
Before it goes down, I make sure that my son set
You made so strong, you made this whole song
You made me Young OG, love you Johan

Troubled tears, they'll land you there
Open your eyes it's all a disguise
The fear that you feel, is not real, not real
The fear that you feel, is not real, no
Similar sky, similar ties
But I know all about you, I do",Young OG II

Luna piena 
Tu che vai a cena 
Io da stamattina che aspetto questa sera poi 
Poi chiami agitata dici non puoi 
Che vuoi andare con le amiche al ""Prima o poi"" 
Più tardi infine andrete a farvi un altro giro 
Giro per casa in cerca di calma 
Cambio maglia, cambio, canale, canzone 
Cambio espressione umore e in fondo 
Per quanto posso cambiare mi cambi il mondo 
Luna piena dico, ma che sistema 
Ora questa mia sera ma chi me la sistema? 
Non vedi che penso soltanto a te 
Magiche esperienze io penso soltanto a te 
Li sento appena, sai non è un problema, lo sento
Non so cosa fare in questo momento 
Al momento non vedi che penso soltanto a te 
Magiche esperienze, io penso soltanto a te

Quel che più riconosco 
È come ora più che mai quello che ho nascosto 
Nonostante il disordine rimane tutto nello stesso posto (nello stesso posto)
Ed è inutile poi dire che non mi riconosco 
È che non so come potrei dirti no 
Io tornerò sempre nello stesso posto 
Ora che sei quel che più riconosco

Quando chiamo io, e quando chiami tu 
O quanto chiami tu in confronto a quanto ti amo io 
Inizialmente pensavo ""qui non si sa?"" 
So quando inizia ma non so mai se finirà 
In casa ancora, poi chiama un amico 
Lui parla ascolta pensa ""non l'ho capito"" 
Non provo interesse per quel che non riguarda te 
Magiche esperienze, io penso soltanto a te
Dio mio ma che confusione 
Quanta, quanta pena che ci vediamo appena 
La gente corre ma in curva non frena 
Lei non prende sonno e quando dorme trema 
Luna piena tu che vai a cena io da stamattina che aspetto questa sera 
Oh, io quanti errori commetto, tienimi stretto (tienimi stretto, stretto tienimi stretto)

Quel che più riconosco 
È come ora più che mai quello che ho nascosto 
Nonostante il disordine rimane tutto nello stesso posto (nello stesso posto)
Ed è inutile poi dire che non mi riconosco 
È che non so come potrei dirti no 
Io tornerò sempre nello stesso posto 
Ora che sei quel che più riconosco

Qualche mese fa una cartomante 
Dall'andamento opposto al rassicurante 
Volle sapere cosa combini in verità 
Tanta voglia di fare finisce poi che si strafà 
Fuggo via dalla fretta che mi aspetta qui 
Il distante è interessante, cosa aspetta chi? 
Che se è così ci sarà un motivo, dimmi sì
Vedi che aspetto una risposta, avanti dimmi sì
Ma oh, io quanti errori commetto tienimi stretto (tienimi stretto, stretto tienimi stretto)
Stretto a tal punto che non respiro, manca l'aria
Anche l'ambiente che mi circonda qui non varia 
Fuggo via dalla fretta che mi aspetta qui 
Il distante è interessante, cosa aspetta chi? 
E se è così ci sarà un motivo, dimmi sì
Vedi che aspetto una risposta, avanti dimmi sì 

Quel che più riconosco 
È come ora più che mai quello che ho nascosto 
Nonostante il disordine, rimane tutto nello stesso posto 
Ed è inutile poi dire che non mi riconosco 
È che non so come potrei dirti no 
Io tornerò sempre nello stesso posto

Io mangiavo lucertole aperte da ragazzino
tornavo a casa e vomitavo in mezzo al giardino
non ho mai smesso un giorno di fantasticare,
non ho mai fatto grandi successi in generale,
guardando gli altri mi sembravano cosi' lontani,
chiedendomi se a casa loro volassero i divani!
L'ultima volta che mio padre e' andato a letto con mia madre
prese a calci una parete e in testa gli cadde una trave,
e mio fratello che mi chiese quanto fosse grave,
fatto sta che litigando si divisero le strade,
anche se restano le urla e rimangono le grida,
per casa, per strada raga...

Ho perso la testa troppe volte da ragazzino,
ogni flash mi nascondevo in uno stanzino,
ho ancora qualche problema a socializzare
ma tutto sommato non diresti che sto andando male
e questo e' Fibra Fibra l'anno scorso dove andava,
posso dire una cazzata? mi son ripulito raga
non c'e' stata mai la strada da seguire in qualche modo che sfiga
sfiga e' Fabri Fibra,
hai comprato il mio cd e lo canti tutto a memoria,
e' uno scandalo quando poi l'hai copiato a meta' scuola
questo e' il mio passaparola, questo e' l'anno ""abbasso Vibra!""
doppia F e' la mia sigla raga.

RIT

Ora se tu hai seguito il mio percorso
come se fosse un concorso
allora fai l'ultimo sforzo e chiediti il perche'.
E' sempre il solito discorso ogni mattina col rimorso
almeno pagami il rimborso e vaffanculo anche a te.
Non voglio Fibra in giro,
non voglio Fibra ai party,
non voglio chi ha successo, non voglio quattro infarti
non voglio far del bene perche' tu non vuoi bene
non si puo' stare insieme se m'ingorghi le vene
non domandarti come passano i giorni e le notti,
non guardi mamma mentre piange e lacrima dagli occhi.
Cambio lavoro cambio casa cambio figa,
cambio le amicizie che sfiga!

Quando guardo la tele vedo facce importanti
Non capisco i discorsi e resto tra gli ignoranti
Quanti simpatizzanti di manifesti americani
Ma cosa pensi di invogliarmi vengo dai portici ercolani
Voglio andare dove a chi ruba staccano orecchie gambe e mani
Potrei avere una moglie zitta se fossi nato tra gli afghani

Ma solo troie di qua vedo mignotte di la
Con me chi ci proverà io non avrò pietà
Incontro troie di qua vedo mignotte di la
Ma non dobbiamo accontentarci di queste zoccole

Dicono cose assurde del tipo prova anche tu a sfondare
Alla porta chi bussa torna quando sei un po' cresciuta
Ma questa velina russa che faccia da prostituta
Come dirò a mio figlio che esistono i pedofili al mondo
Oggi che in galera ci vai soltanto per stupro
La mia ex fidanzata adesso sta a capo verde
Perché è una vita che sogna il negro dentro il suo imbuto!

Al posto di stupide minorate minorenni in minigonna
Fanno tanto le emancipate e poi che vergogna
Quando a letto le spogli è più maiala mia nonna
Dimmi tu cosa pensi di quel padre di famiglia
Che andava a Cuba a farsi le ragazze più giovani della figlia
Quando vent'anni fa prometteva fedeltà alla moglie
Ma non esiste marito che non sia mai andato a troie!

La ragazza amore mio Ã¨ ancora chiusa in galera
io mi chiedo e mi domando quando uscirÃ 
sono anche passati gli anni in cui ero minorenne
abbiamo fatto un pÃ² di danni ma quando uscirÃ ?
e pensare che eravamo affiatati parecchio
e siamo diventati i piÃ¹ famosi della cittÃ 
siamo anche finiti in tele c'ha visto l'Italia
amore mio ti rendi conto che pubblicitÃ 
ma chissÃ  cosa pensava la piccola Sofia
quando volava dal balcone spaccata a metÃ 
mi sarebbe piaciuto almeno questo Natale
ritornare a casa mia salutare papÃ 
se penso che perÃ² ho esagerato
e magari lo ammetto che mi sono sbilanciato
lanciato mi sono pure sputtanato
ho macchiato il maglione di sangue appena l'ho comprato
me l'hanno pure sequestrato mi sono entrati
in camera anche senza un mandato
ho pure fatto 21 anni e il giorno del
compleanno non l'ho neanche festeggiato
peccato!mi hanno rinchiuso in questa cella
sapessi che fastidio in bagno essere toccato
mi fanno uscire il giorno in cui presenterÃ²
a qualche prete un piano di volontariato
io se ho fatto quel che ho fatto
Ã¨ perchÃ¨ quando l'ho fatto
ero fatto anche troppo innamorato
solo perchÃ¨ ti immagino con gente nuda
e commetto un reato dicono questo Ã¨ malato
e poi cos'Ã¨ questa storia cariata
cazzo vai a dire in giro che non sei piÃ¹ innamorata?
come puoi trovarti un nuovo ragazzo
dopo quello che abbiamo passato ma sei ubriaca?!
e se magari fai un figlio scommetto
il povero neonato finirÃ  in un sacchetto
dopo tutte queste madri che impazziscono
e abbandonano il figlio dentro qualche cassonetto
dopo le 97 coltellate per uccidere tua madre
con i tagli nel petto
dopo tutte le versioni che ho detto
ti permetti di portare un altro uomo nel letto?
ma visto che sognavi di perdere tuo fratello
io ti uccido pure lui almeno il quadro Ã¨ perfetto
e adesso che potremo stare io e te da soli
t'innamori di un altro ma tu lo fai per dispetto?!!

Rit:
Oh problemi di coppia ma dico non lo sai prima
o poi che la coppia scoppia la coppia scoppia
la la la la la coppia scoppia la la la la la
Oh problemi di spazio si ma cosa fai se ti
nasce un figlio pazzo un figlio pazzo
figlio pazzo figlio pazzo pazzo pazzo
Oh l'amore ti blocca ma dico non lo sai prima
o poi che la coppia scoppia la coppia scoppia
la la la la la coppia scoppia la la la la la

quindi io stanotte mi devo sfogare

mi sveglio con in mano una consumazione
ti porto un cane morto per colazione
vedo solo grasse moccolone e i ragazzi
che assomigliano a Taricone
arrivo con la faccia dello sbruffone
cammino con il passo da strascicone
quando entro nei club scatta l'inventiva
qui la gente mi conosce come Fabri Fibra
ho l'energia implosiva quando gonfio
la mia pancia dalla cannabis attiva
e quando perdo la saliva e meglio che
prendi aria altrimenti non sai chi arriva
ho la mascella che mi vibra e se parlo s'inca
ca castra porca figa mi piace fare il galante
solamente con donne che hanno 1000 euro in contante
esco dal coma e mi rimetto al volante
ho fatto inversione a U in piazza Dante
se magari faccio testa coda e lei s'appoggia
alla mia spalla cosa fa ci prova?
se magari sei in competizione con tua madre
vuoi punirla cosa fai chiami Omar?
oh queste ragazze appena lo prendono
diventano subito pazze cambieranno religioni
perÃ² le mestruazioni ci sono in tutte quante le razze
se la mia ragazza fa la troia in palestra
appena torna a casa io le spacco la testa
e quando impazzirÃ² perchÃ¨ il lavoro mi stressa
allora lancerÃ² mio figlio dalla finestra
oh!quale sarebbe la nazione piÃ¹ adatta
per trovarsi una ragazza con il cuore di latta
questo trambusto ormonale non passa
e fai un figlio a 70 anni e vedrai come scappa
ma io non voglio impazzire per una sciatta
che tra lei e sua madre non si sa chi Ã¨ piÃ¹ vacca
perchÃ¨ magari fa la donna in carriera
fai la mogliettina sexy anche la mamma che allatta

A parte il rap io sono un fallito
Stacchi questa musica e son bello che finito
A volte mi sembra davvero di essere impazzito
Ma ho visto anche i fumetti su di me in qualche sito
La gente è convinta che con il rap ci guadagniamo
Se appari in un giornale è come se non fossi umano
Qualcuno che fa il botto c'è, può essere fortuna
Sembra che se non fai il botto finirai sei piedi sotto
E se per ogni uomo esistono 7 ragazze
Guarda me le son giocate incontrandole tutte pazze
Se c'ho la faccia stanca è perché l'incubo continua
Impazzirei se tutto riniziasse domattina
E anche volendolo
Io non saprei tornare come prima
Corro scrivo registro ma non sento nessuna rima
La mia voce riascoltandola neanche sembra la mia
Resterò qui altre 8 ore augurandomi un attacco di cuore

Io non voglio idee stupide

Mi hanno battezzato in chiesa
Fra attenzioni e vari affetti
Cresciuto in mezzo ai quadri con Gesù e gli angioletti
Una classica famiglia cristiana ha I suoi difetti
Ed è per questo che quando bestemmi dopo ci rifletti
E magari ti penti, ""Questa è l'ultima"" prometti
E giri il mondo disegnando Dio per terra coi gessetti
Ma il diavolo entra in casa anche se tu non te lo aspetti
L'insoddisfazione arriva anche se c'hai I figli perfetti
Io ringrazio il cielo per non essere nato un bigotto
Per non essere un ciellino o un fissato all'Enalotto
Ringrazio Dio per non avere un padre che fa il poliziotto
Mio padre non è un ladro né un politico corrotto
Mia madre per capirlo avrebbe dato via anche un rene
Anche se a volte le persone impazziscono a stare insieme
Sono dieci anni che provo a dimostrare loro qualcosa
Ma per stare con entrambi a me mi servirebbe un sosia

Supponendo, chissà con chi uscirei, che farei

E se magari sputtani qualcuno allora sei anche un figo
Mi sta sul cazzo Grido, I gemelli, il cugino
Duecento nomi a caso di gente che non sa persino che io rimo
Chi sia abituati a facce vecchie
Ma le rime che io scrivo bastonano alle orecchie
E visto che c'ho un pubblico cresciuto dal niente
Me ne sbatto del modo in cui muove il culo la gente
Sta roba prende perché è intraprendente
Musica che aiuta a sfuggire dal niente
Te lo direbbe anche una muta
Ma Dio quanto possa essere falso io
Quanto possa andare in basso mi stupisco anche io
Quando parli mi stai sul cazzo si fa si sa
Non ho palle abbastanza grandi per cambiar città

con il ragazzo che pensava lei facesse per gioco

giro in macchina a faccia sfatta
mentre guido al telefono metto la cravatta
cinque morti su dieci per guida distratta

eppure questo camion tra un pÃ² mi schiaccia
non ho mica il Van Gogh a chi dai la caccia?

o di altra gente scomparsa dall'oggi al domani
se ti immedesimassi in me capiresti i miei piani
non sono poi cosi diverso dai tanti italiani
che la mattina vanno in bagno con le palle dei cani
al posto degli occhi per un turno e uno stipendo da infami
in un sistema che Ã¨ meglio se ne stiamo lontani
perchÃ¨ Ã¨ la coca che distrugge un grande come Pantani
mica la gente che c'Ã¨ intorno e vuole show da marziani

speravi che questa roba non facesse piÃ¹ effetto

fino a ieri tu di me non conoscevi mezza rima

canto in bunker in tendoni in covi morti e nei locali

Che mi bacia alla spagnola
Cos’è un bacio alla spagnola?
Cosa fai lo domandi a un uomo?
Vallo a chiedere alla tua fidanzata

Voglio una ragazza incazzata
Anzi no la voglio tranquilla
Voglio mettere su famiglia
Come nello spot della Barilla
Di recente contemplo raramente
Vorrei farmi due ragazze contemporaneamente

Mi piacciono le donne, le donne,le donne,le more, le bionde

Le top-model con due bombe

Vorrei uscire con una marocchina,
Algerina, tunisina, slovena,
Egiziana, rumena, americana,
Portoricana, una marziana,
In vacanza con una romana a Londra
Eri castana e ritorni bionda
Dimmi che c’hai una sorella gemella che semi-nuda balla alla Lorella
Andiamo a cena fuori all’aperto e poi scappiamo appena il conto chiama
Il cameriere ci vede e urla
Anvedi ‘sto figlio de ‘na putta

Canto le donne e lo sai
Ma ci sono donne che non vorrei mai
Neanche se fossimo a Santo Domingo
Domandi
Sei serio?
Non sai quanto
Non uscirei mai con Lory Del Santo
O donne di quello stampo
Fredde, congelate come uno scampo
E se ti innamori non hai scampo
E qualche volta fai dei sogni strani
Quei calendari con ragazze in bikini
Al posto della solita modella che si sdraia
Sogno le foto sexy della tabaccaia,
Della benzinaia, della giornalaia, della fornaia",Le  Donne

Comandare è meglio che scopare, di chi era questa?
Io lo so, lo diceva (come non detto)
Tu che ci fai qui? Dice ""passo per caso""
Sì, a un concerto passi per caso
Pensi che la beva come chi, come chi vota Lega?
Disco funkadelistico non è questo
La storia è acida, quando la senti fai aaahhh
Preso male come Lucio Dalla, regionale via da Senigallia
Non vedevo l'ora di andare via
E ora non vedo l'ora di ritornare a casa

Ancora lavorare, ancora lavorare, ancora lavorare...
Beh, comunque ho il suo cellulare
Ogni tanto le messaggio, dico ""ciao, come stai?""
Lei mi risponde ""ci vediamo, scopiamo?""
E' strano, un tempo ero io che la cercavo
Ma non ero abbastanza famoso
Chi è troppo non va con chi è poco famoso
Poi becca il tronista e chi l'ha più vista
Oggi invece mi chiama, mi cerca, mi ama
Volessi farmela sì che potrei
Ma che tristezza, bambole di pezza
Mi domandi ""e perché non te le fai?""

Fallo prima che lo faccia qualcun altro

Dai sali in macchina e sfonda quelle casse

Chiedimi: ""Che c'è?""
""Fatti i cazzi tuoi""

Droga dilaga, Fibroga saga
Qui si rimedia, due tiri mega
Cominci dal gusto ma poi ti frega
È naturale, non si spiega
Come farsi una sega
Quando salgo sul palco questa vita è strana
Odio le interviste, come i Nirvana
Mi fermo e non esiste, come la fama
Anche se per averla un secondo si vende l'anima
Questa è una giungla lo sai, questa è una giungla
E il più debole sprofonda, il debole sprofonda
Ora si fuma lo sai, ora si fuma

Fabri Fibra,"Legalizzare non significa invitare tutti al consumo
Legalizzare non significa spingere tutti a farsi le canne
Al contrario, regolamentare, sottrarre all’illegalità
Se lo Stato imponesse alla cannabis la stessa imposta che impone al tabacco
Incasserebbe in un anno dai sei agli otto miliardi di euro

Direi agli scettici legalizzate
Perché legalizzare significa sottrarre un mercato immenso alle organizzazioni criminali
Toglieremmo dagli otto agli undici miliardi alle organizzazioni
Questo danato è usato dalle organizzazioni mafiose per corrompere la politica
L’amministrazione pubblica
E a far collassare le nostre democrazie

Tutto questo significa che ci sottraggono diritti
Il Portogallo nel 2001 depenalizza la cannabis e in quindici anni diminuisce il consumo
L’Uruguay nel 2013 e il Colorado nel 2014 ne legalizzano il commercio a scopo ricreativo
E anche qui il consumo dimininuisce invece di aumentare
Ecco perché chi con senso di responsabilità sostiene la legalità 
E si auspica che il consumo di droghe diminusica

Dovrebbe essere favorevole alla legalizzazione della cannabis
Misura che toglie risorse alle organizzazioni criminali
E che avrebbe, come effetto immediato, la diminuzione dei consumi
Come avvenuto nei paesi che hanno avuto il coraggio di cambiare",Considerazioni (Skit)

A casa ancora mamma pensa che suo figlio 
Non sia altro che un bambino 
Mi parla come fossi un cretino 
Lei non vuole che io abbia successo 
Perché sa che per averlo dovrei parlare di ciò che mi è successo 
In famiglia ero depresso 
In famiglia I miei giorni più tristi 
La famiglia che mi odia perché ne parlo in tutti i miei dischi 
I giornalisti dicono sono incazzato a casaccio 
Combattere con il mio passato è quello che faccio 
Un altro personaggio come me lo sai che non esiste 
Mille paure che affronto 
Mille viaggi

Ho preso tanto e tanto ho dato 
Ma non sai quanto mi sento odiato 
Non ho mai chiesto a nessuno aiuto 
Cosa mi dai adesso che ho tutto? 

Terza strofa, un kamikaze per quello che dico 
Sai una cosa? 
A me interessa solo essere capito 
Non pensare 
Sia solo un modo per vendere più copie 
Lascia stare 
La gente prima o poi il trucco lo scopre 
Bell’affare 
Non si capisce chi è vero e falso 
Parli male di me perché, boh
Dopo tutto quello che ho fatto 
Ma non voglio più stare fermo a fissare uno schermo 
A pagare per i miei peccati come se fossimo già all’inferno 
Qui non faccio polemica 
Chi ti ama ti merita 
Ho solo detto la verità 
E tu lo sai perché eri qua 
E tu lo sai che così non va 
Che tutto questo è contraddittorio 
E ti ricordo quanta merda hai lanciato sul mio lavoro 
Ma non porto nessun rancore e volevo che lo sapessi 
Spendo solo altre due parole 
Preferivo i tuoi primi testi 
Non avevi tutta la pressione che adesso ti mette mamma 
E sentirti parlare d’amore dopo un po’ mi stanca

Ho preso tanto e tanto ho dato 
Ma non sai quanto mi sento odiato 
Non ho mai chiesto a nessuno aiuto 
Cosa mi dai adesso che ho tutto?",Nessun Aiuto

Fabri Fibra,"Perché sono così cattivo, non c’hai mai pensato? 
Non sai cos’ho passato 
Non te l’ho mai spiegato? 
Mia madre mi soffoca da quando sono nato 
Mi vorrebbe morto dopo quello che son diventato 
Per lei è difficile accettare che ora sono grande 
Prendevo botte fino a quando non usciva il sangue 
Se non pulisci camera 
Ordina quei cassetti guarda 
Non esci di casa finché non pulisci la mansarda 
Ho parlato con i professori dicono, ""sei stupido"" 
Dovresti andare via di casa, ""quando? Subito"" 
Mia madre non voleva che in casa avessimo animali, infatti 
Una mattina mi sveglio e non c’erano più i miei gatti

E non è mai finita con mia madre

Tu mai calma 
'Sta vita è un dramma 
Perdono mamma 

Voleva che restassi chiuso in casa, mia madre 
Risposta vera o falsa chi lo sa, con mia madre 
Che mi fumava in faccia a sedici anni, mia madre 
Dicendo ""dalla faccia mi ricordi tuo padre"" 
Come se fosse colpa mia 
Ho perso ogni compagnia 
Soffro di claustrofobia appena parlo di mia madre 
Non voleva che uscissi con una ragazza mia madre 
Mi parlava con gli occhi fissi di una pazza mia madre 
Non mi ha mai incoraggiato a fare niente mia madre 
Mi diceva, mi diceva ""sei impotente mia madre"" 
Ripeteva queste cattiverie per farmi male 
Poi di nuovo ""sembri tuo padre, mi fai schifo animale"" 
""Mamma lasciami andare 
Non mi parlare come un pupazzo 
Non so più stare in mezzo alla gente ho i pensieri di un pazzo"" 
Mi sento solo e ringrazio mia madre

Mia madre mi manda messaggi mi dice ""ti guardo quando vai in tv"" 
Poi chiama dicendo ""ho visto che parli di casa non farlo mai più"" 
Lei teme che io dica a tutti quanti schiaffi ho preso 
Per capirlo basta guardare come son venuto sù 
Non faccio bella figura ma infondo dimmi chi la fa 
Ho avuto sempre paura ad affrontare la verità 
Ora son qui a dirla a tutti, vedi la maschera cade 
Al posto del pubblico ai concerti vedo mia madre 
Sono sincero e qui lo dico sto avendo una crisi 
In giro devo sempre fingere mille sorrisi 
Non voglio più tenermi dentro questo peso 
La mia gioventù passata come un incompreso 
Se mia madre fosse qui adesso mi direbbe ""non ti vergogni?"" 
Non aiuti mai tuo fratello 
Lui che insegue i tuoi stessi sogni 
Parlare di questo era il mio più grande problema 
Finisce il testo
Mamma, volevi che fossi me stesso?

Fabrizio De André,"""Poterti smembrare coi denti e le mani, 
sapere i tuoi occhi bevuti dai cani, 
di morire in croce puoi essere grato 
a un brav'uomo di nome Pilato."" 

Ben più della morte che oggi ti vuole, 
t'uccide il veleno di queste parole: 
le voci dei padri di quei neonati, 
da Erode per te trucidati. 

Nel lugubre scherno degli abiti nuovi 
misurano a gocce il dolore che provi; 
trent'anni hanno atteso col fegato in mano, 
i rantoli d'un ciarlatano. 

Si muovono curve le vedove in testa, 
per loro non è un pomeriggio di festa; 
si serran le vesti sugli occhi e sul cuore 
ma filtra dai veli il dolore: 

fedeli umiliate da un credo inumano 
che le volle schiave già prima di Abramo, 
con riconoscenza ora soffron la pena 
di chi perdonò a Maddalena, 

di chi con un gesto soltanto fraterno 
una nuova indulgenza insegnò al Padreterno, 
e guardano in alto, trafitti dal sole, 
gli spasimi d'un redentore. 

Confusi alla folla ti seguono muti, 
sgomenti al pensiero che tu li saluti: 
""A redimere il mondo"" gli serve pensare, 
il tuo sangue può certo bastare. 

La semineranno per mare e per terra 
tra boschi e città la tua buona novella, 
ma questo domani, con fede migliore, 
stasera è più forte il terrore. 

Nessuno di loro ti grida un addio 
per esser scoperto cugino di Dio: 
gli apostoli han chiuso le gole alla voce, 
fratello che sanguini in croce. 

Han volti distesi, già inclini al perdono, 
ormai che han veduto il tuo sangue di uomo 
fregiarti le membra di rivoli viola, 
incapace di nuocere ancora. 

Il potere vestito d'umana sembianza, 
ormai ti considera morto abbastanza 
e già volge lo sguardo a spiar le intenzioni 
degli umili, degli straccioni. 

Ma gli occhi dei poveri piangono altrove, 
non sono venuti a esibire un dolore 
che alla via della croce ha proibito l'ingresso 
a chi ti ama come se stesso. 

Sono pallidi al volto, scavati al torace, 
non hanno la faccia di chi si compiace 
dei gesti che ormai ti propone il dolore, 
eppure hanno un posto d'onore. 

Non hanno negli occhi scintille di pena. 
Non sono stupiti a vederti la schiena 
piegata dal legno che a stento trascini, 
eppure ti stanno vicini. 

Perdonali se non ti lasciano solo, 
se sanno morir sulla croce anche loro, 
a piangerli sotto non han che le madri, 
in fondo, son solo due ladri.",Via Della Croce
Fabrizio De André,"Mai più mi chinai e nemmeno su un fiore
Più non arrossii nel rubare l'amore
Dal momento che Inverno mi convinse che Dio
Non sarebbe arrossito rubandomi il mio

Mi arrestarono un giorno per le donne ed il vino
Non avevano leggi per punire un blasfemo
Non mi uccise la morte, ma due guardie bigotte
Mi cercarono l'anima a forza di botte

Perché dissi che Dio imbrogliò il primo uomo
Lo costrinse a viaggiare una vita da scemo
Nel giardino incantato lo costrinse a sognare
A ignorare che al mondo c'e' il bene e c'è il male

Quando vide che l'uomo allungava le dita
A rubargli il mistero di una mela proibita
Per paura che ormai non avesse padroni
Lo fermò con la morte, inventò le stagioni

Mi cercarono l'anima a forza di botte

E se furon due guardie a fermarmi la vita
È proprio qui sulla terra la mela proibita
E non Dio, ma qualcuno che per noi l'ha inventato

Fabrizio De André,"Cosa vuol dire avere un metro e mezzo di statura
Ve lo rivelan gli occhi e le battute della gente
O la curiosità di una ragazza irriverente
Che li avvicina solo per un suo dubbio impertinente
Vuole scoprir se è vero quanto si dice intorno ai nani
Che siano I più forniti della virtù meno apparente
Fra tutte le virtù la più indecente

Passano gli anni I mesi, e se li conti anche I minuti
È triste trovarsi adulti senza essere cresciuti
La maldicenza insiste, batte la lingua sul tamburo
Fino a dire che un nano è una carogna di sicuro
Perché ha il cuore troppo, troppo vicino al buco del culo

Fu nelle notti insonni vegliate al lume del rancore
Che preparai gli esami, diventai procuratore
Per imboccare la strada che dalle panche di una cattedrale
Porta alla sacrestia quindi alla cattedra di un tribunale
Giudice finalmente, arbitro in terra del bene e del male

E allora la mia statura non dispensò più buonumore
A chi alla sbarra in piedi mi diceva ""Vostro Onore""
E di affidarli al boia fu un piacere del tutto mio
Prima di genuflettermi nell'ora dell'addio

e ti viene la voglia di uscire e provare 
che cosa ti manca per correre al prato, 
e ti tieni la voglia, e rimani a pensare 
come diavolo fanno a riprendere fiato. 

Da uomo avvertire il tempo sprecato 
a farti narrare la vita dagli occhi 
e mai poter bere alla coppa d'un fiato 
ma a piccoli sorsi interrotti, 
e mai poter bere alla coppa d'un fiato 
ma a piccoli sorsi interrotti. 

Eppure un sorriso io l'ho regalato 
e ancora ritorna in ogni sua estate 
quando io la guidai o fui forse guidato 
a contarle i capelli con le mani sudate. 

Non credo che chiesi promesse al suo sguardo, 
non mi sembra che scelsi il silenzio o la voce, 
quando il cuore stordÃ¬ e ora no, non ricordo 
se fu troppo sgomento o troppo felice, 
e il cuore impazzÃ¬ e ora no, non ricordo, 
da quale orizzonte sfumasse la luce. 

E fra lo spettacolo dolce dell'erba 
fra lunghe carezze finite sul volto, 
quelle sue cosce color madreperla 
rimasero forse un fiore non colto. 

Ma che la baciai questo sÃ¬ lo ricordo 
col cuore ormai sulle labbra, 
ma che la baciai, per Dio, sÃ¬ lo ricordo, 
e il mio cuore le restÃ² sulle labbra.

Fabrizio De André,"Daltonici, presbiti, mendicanti di vista 
Il mercante di luce, il vostro oculista
Ora vuole soltanto clienti speciali 
Che non sanno che farne di occhi normali

Non più ottico ma spacciatore di lenti 
Per improvvisare occhi contenti
Perché le pupille abituate a copiare 
Inventino i mondi sui quali guardare
Seguite con me questi occhi sognare
Fuggire dall'orbita e non voler ritornare

Vedo che salgo a rubare il sole 
Per non aver più notti
Perché non cada in reti di tramonto
L'ho chiuso nei miei occhi
E chi avrà freddo 
Lungo il mio sguardo si dovrà scaldare

Vedo i fiumi dentro le mie vene
Cercano, cercano, cercano, cercano il loro mare
Rompono gli argini, gli argini, gli argini
Trovano cieli, cieli, cieli, cieli da fotografare
Sangue che scorre senza fantasia 
Porta tumori di malinconia

Vedo gendarmi pascolare 
Donne chine sulla rugiada
(Vedo gendarmi pascolare, donne chine sulla rugiada)
Rosse le lingue al polline dei fiori 
Ma dov'è l'ape regina? 
(Rosse le lingue al polline dei fiori, ma dov'è l'ape regina? )
Forse è volata ai nidi dell'aurora
Forse volata, forse più non vola

Vedo gli amici ancora sulla strada
Loro non hanno fretta
Rubano ancora al sonno l'allegria 
All'alba un po' di notte
E poi la luce, luce che trasforma 
Il mondo in un giocattolo

di Nobel che gli espone la praticità

Maria ignorata da un Edipo ormai scaltro 
mima una sua nostalgia di natività, 
io con la mia bomba porto la novità, 
la bomba che debutta in società, 
al ballo mascherato della celebrità. 

Dante alla porta di Paolo e Francesca 
spia chi fa meglio di lui: 
lì dietro si racconta un amore normale 
ma lui saprà poi renderlo tanto geniale. 

E il viaggio all'inferno ora fallo da solo 
con l'ultima invidia lasciata là sotto un lenzuolo, 
sorpresa sulla porta d'una felicità 
la bomba ha risparmiato la normalità, 
al ballo mascherato della celebrità. 

La bomba non ha una natura gentile 
ma spinta da imparzialità 
sconvolge l'improbabile intimità

Nelson strappato al suo carnevale 
rincorre la sua identità 
e cerca la sua maschera, l'orgoglio, lo stile, 
impegnati sempre a vincere e mai a morire. 

Poi dalla feluca ormai a brandelli 
tenta di estrarre il consiglio della sua Trafalgar 
e nella sua agonia, sparsa di qua, di là, 
implora una Sant'Elena anche in comproprietà, 
al ballo mascherato della celebrità. 

Mio padre pretende aspirina ed affetto 
e inciampa nella sua autorità, 
affida a una vestaglia il suo ultimo ruolo 
ma lui esplode dopo, prima il suo decoro. 

Mia madre si approva in frantumi di specchio, 
dovrebbe accettare la bomba con serenità, 
il martirio è il suo mestiere, la sua vanità, 
ma ora accetta di morire soltanto a metà 
la sua parte ancora viva le fa tanta pietà, 
al ballo mascherato della celebrità. 

Qualcuno ha lasciato la luna nel bagno 
accesa soltanto a metà 
quel poco che mi basta per contare i caduti, 
stupirmi della loro fragilità, 
e adesso puoi togliermi i piedi dal collo 
amico che m'hai insegnato il ""come si fa""

Fabrizio De André,"Imputato ascolta, 
noi ti abbiamo ascoltato. 

Tu non sapevi di avere una coscienza al fosforo 
piantata tra l'aorta e l'intenzione, 
noi ti abbiamo osservato 
dal primo battere del cuore 
fino ai ritmi più brevi 
dell'ultima emozione 
quando uccidevi, 
favorendo il potere 
i soci vitalizi del potere 
ammucchiati in discesa 
a difesa 
della loro celebrazione. 

E se tu la credevi vendetta 
il fosforo di guardia 
segnalava la tua urgenza di potere 
mentre ti emozionavi nel ruolo più eccitante della legge 
quello che non protegge 
la parte del boia. 

Imputato, 
il dito più lungo della tua mano 
è il medio 
quello della mia 
è l'indice, 
eppure anche tu hai giudicato. 

Hai assolto e hai condannato 
al di sopra di me, 
ma al di sopra di me, 
per quello che hai fatto, 
per come lo hai rinnovato 
il potere ti è grato. 

Ascolta 
una volta un giudice come me 
giudicò chi gli aveva dettato la legge: 
prima cambiarono il giudice 
e subito dopo 
la legge. 

Oggi, un giudice come me, 
lo chiede al potere se può giudicare. 
Tu sei il potere.

Fabrizio De André,"Un po' di tempo fa Nancy era senza compagnia 
All'ultimo spettacolo con la sua bigiotteria

Nel palazzo di giustizia suo padre era innocente 
Nel palazzo del mistero non c'era proprio niente 
Non c'era quasi niente

Un po' di tempo fa eravamo distratti 
Lei portava calze verdi dormiva con tutti

Ma cosa fai domani non lo chiese mai a nessuno 
S'innamorò di tutti noi non proprio di qualcuno 
Non solo di qualcuno

E un po' di tempo fa col telefono rotto 
Cercò dal terzo piano la sua serenità

Dicevamo che era libera e nessuno era sincero 
Non l'avremmo corteggiata mai nel palazzo del mistero 
Nel palazzo del ministero

E dove mandi I tuoi pensieri adesso trovi Nancy a fermarli 
Molti hanno usato il suo corpo molti hanno pettinato I suoi capelli
E nel vuoto della notte quando hai freddo e sei perduto 
È ancora Nancy che ti dice

Che agli animali si vuol giocare
Sono la femmina camicia aperta
Piccole tette da succhiare

Sotto le ciglia di questi alberi
Nel chiaroscuro dove son nato
Che l'orizzonte prima del cielo
Ero lo sguardo di mia madre

""Che Fernandinho è come una figlia
Mi porta a letto caffè e tapioca
E a ricordargli che è nato maschio
Sarà l'istinto sarà la vita""

E io davanti allo specchio grande
Mi paro gli occhi con le dita a immaginarmi
Tra le gambe una minuscola fica

Nel dormiveglia della corriera
Lascio l'infanzia contadina
Corro all'incanto dei desideri
Vado a correggere la fortuna

Nella cucina della pensione
Mescolo i sogni con gli ormoni
Ad albeggiare sarà magia
Saranno seni miracolosi

Perché Fernanda è proprio una figlia
Come una figlia vuol far l'amore
Ma Fernandinho resiste e vomita
E si contorce dal dolore

E allora il bisturi per seni e fianchi
In una vertigine di anestesia
Finché il mio corpo mi rassomigli
Sul lungomare di Bahia

Sorriso tenero di verdefoglia
Dai suoi capelli sfilo le dita
Quando le macchine puntano i fari
Sul palcoscenico della mia vita

Dove tra ingorghi di desideri
Alle mie natiche un maschio s'appende
Nella mia carne tra le mie labbra
Un uomo scivola l'altro si arrende

Che Fernandinho mi è morto in grembo
Fernanda è una bambola di seta
Sono le braci di un'unica stella
Che squilla di luce di nome Princesa

A un avvocato di Milano
Ora Princesa regala il cuore
E un passeggiare recidivo
Nella penombra di un balcone

celebrative del nulla 
lungo un facile vento 
di sazietà di impunità 

Sullo scandalo metallico 
di armi in uso e in disuso 
a guidare la colonna 
di dolore e di fumo 
che lascia le infinite battaglie al calar della sera 
la maggioranza sta la maggioranza sta 
recitando un rosario 
di ambizioni meschine 
di millenarie paure 
di inesauribili astuzie 

Coltivando tranquilla 
l'orribile varietà 
delle proprie superbie 
la maggioranza sta 
come una malattia 
come una sfortuna 
come un'anestesia 
come un'abitudine 
per chi viaggia in direzione ostinata e contraria 

col suo marchio speciale di speciale disperazione 
e tra il vomito dei respinti muove gli ultimi passi 
per consegnare alla morte una goccia di splendore 
di umanità di verità 

per chi ad Aqaba curò la lebbra con uno scettro posticcio 
e seminò il suo passaggio di gelosie devastatrici e di figli 
con improbabili nomi di cantanti di tango 
in un vasto programma di eternità 

ricorda Signore questi servi disobbedienti 
alle leggi del branco 
non dimenticare il loro volto 
che dopo tanto sbandare 
è appena giusto che la fortuna li aiuti 
come una svista 
come un'anomalia 
come una distrazione 
come un dovere",Smisurata Preghiera
Fabrizio De André,"E te ne vai, Maria, fra l'altra gente 
Che si raccoglie intorno al tuo passare
Siepe di sguardi che non fanno male 
Nella stagione di essere madre

Sai che fra un'ora forse piangerai 
Poi la tua mano nasconderà un sorriso
Gioia e dolore hanno il confine incerto 
Nella stagione che illumina il viso

Ave Maria, adesso che sei donna
Ave alle donne come te, Maria
Femmine un giorno per un nuovo amore 
Povero o ricco, umile o Messia

Femmine un giorno e poi madri per sempre 
Nella stagione che stagioni non sente",Ave Maria
Fabrizio De André,"La chiamavano bocca di rosa
Metteva l'amore, metteva l'amore
La chiamavano bocca di rosa
Metteva l'amore sopra ogni cosa

Appena scese alla stazione
Nel paesino di San Vicario
Tutti si accorsero con uno sguardo
Che non si trattava di un missionario

C'è chi l'amore lo fa per noia
Chi se lo sceglie per professione
Bocca di rosa né l'uno né l'altro
Lei lo faceva per passione

Ma la passione spesso conduce
A soddisfare le proprie voglie
Senza indagare se il concupito
Ha il cuore libero oppure ha moglie

E fu così che da un giorno all'altro
Bocca di rosa si tirò addosso
L'ira funesta delle cagnette
A cui aveva sottratto l'osso

Ma le comari di un paesino
Non brillano certo in iniziativa
Le contromisure fino a quel punto
Si limitavano all'invettiva

Si sa che la gente dà buoni consigli
Sentendosi come Gesù nel tempio
Si sa che la gente dà buoni consigli
Se non può più dare cattivo esempio

Così una vecchia mai stata moglie
Senza mai figli, senza più voglie
Si prese la briga e di certo il gusto
Di dare a tutte il consiglio giusto

E rivolgendosi alle cornute
Le apostrofò con parole argute
""Il furto d'amore sarà punito""
Disse ""all'ordine costituito""

E quelle andarono dal commissario
E dissero senza parafrasare
""Quella schifosa ha già troppi clienti
Più di un consorzio alimentare""

E arrivarono quattro gendarmi
Con i pennacchi con i pennacchi
E arrivarono quattro gendarmi
Con i pennacchi e con le armi

Il cuore tenero non è una dote
Di cui sian colmi i carabinieri
Ma quella volta a prendere il treno
L'accompagnarono malvolentieri

Alla stazione c'erano tutti
Dal commissario al sagrestano
Alla stazione c'erano tutti
Con gli occhi rossi e il cappello in mano

A salutare chi per un poco
Senza pretese, senza pretese
A salutare chi per un poco
Portò l'amore nel paese

C'era un cartello giallo
Con una scritta nera
Diceva ""addio bocca di rosa
Con te se ne parte la primavera""

Ma una notizia un po' originale
Non ha bisogno di alcun giornale
Come una freccia dall'arco scocca
Vola veloce di bocca in bocca

E alla stazione successiva
Molta più gente di quando partiva
Chi mandò un bacio, chi gettò un fiore
Chi si prenota per due ore

Persino il parroco che non disprezza
Fra un miserere e un'estrema unzione
Il bene effimero della bellezza
La vuole accanto in processione

E con la Vergine in prima fila
E bocca di rosa poco lontano
Si porta a spasso per il paese
L'amore sacro e l'amor profano",Bocca di Rosa
Fabrizio De André,"Chi va dicendo in giro
Che odio il mio lavoro
Non sa con quanto amore
Mi dedico al tritolo

Ci metto più attenzione
Sarebbe imperdonabile
Giustiziarmi sul portone
Proprio nel giorno in cui
La decisione è mia

Si ammala di terrore

I latitanti sono loro

Delegato ad altre mani
Sganciato e restituitoci
Dai tuoi aeroplani
Io vengo a restituirti
Un po' del tuo terrore
Del tuo disordine
Del tuo rumore

Così pensava forte
Un trentenne disperato
Se non del tutto giusto
Quasi niente sbagliato
Cercando il luogo idoneo
Adatto al suo tritolo
Insomma il posto degno
D'un bombarolo

C'è chi lo vide ridere
Davanti al Parlamento
Aspettando l'esplosione
Che provasse il suo talento
C'è chi lo vide piangere
Un torrente di vocali
Vedendo esplodere
Un chiosco di giornali

Ma ciò che lo ferì
Profondamente nell'orgoglio
Fu l'immagine di lei
Che si sporgeva da ogni foglio
Lontana dal ridicolo
In cui lo lasciò solo
Ma in prima pagina
Col bombarolo",Il  Bombarolo
Fabrizio De André,"Alla parata militare
Sputò negli occhi a un innocente
E quando lui chiese ""Perché ""
Lui gli rispose ""Questo è niente
E adesso è ora che io vada""
E l'innocente lo seguì
Senza le armi lo seguì
Sulla sua cattiva strada

Sui viali dietro la stazione
Rubò l'incasso a una regina
E quando lei gli disse ""Come""
Lui le risposte ""Forse è meglio è come prima
Forse è ora che io vada ""
E la regina lo seguì
Col suo dolore lo seguì
Sulla sua cattiva strada

E in una notte senza luna
Truccò le stelle ad un pilota
Quando l'aeroplano cadde
Lui disse ""È colpa di chi muore
Comunque è meglio che io vada""
Ed il pilota lo seguì
Senza le stelle lo seguì
Sulla sua cattiva strada

A un diciottenne alcolizzato
Versò da bere ancora un poco
E mentre quello lo guardava
Lui disse ""Amico ci scommetto stai per dirmi
Adesso è ora che io vada""
L'alcolizzato lo capì
Non disse niente e lo seguì
Sulla sua cattiva strada

Ad un processo per amore
Baciò le bocche dei giurati
E ai loro sguardi imbarazzati
Rispose ""Adesso è più normale
Adesso è meglio, adesso è giusto, giusto, è giusto
Che io vada""
Ed i giurati lo seguirono
A bocca aperta lo seguirono

Fabrizio De André,"Quando ero piccolo m'innamoravo di tutto correvo dietro ai cani 
E da marzo a febbraio mio nonno vegliava 
Sulla corrente di cavalli e di buoi 
Sui fatti miei sui fatti tuoi 

E al Dio degli inglesi non credere mai 

E quando avevo duecento lune e forse qualcuna è di troppo 
Rubai il primo cavallo e mi fecero uomo 
Cambiai il mio nome in ""Coda di lupo"" 
Cambiai il mio pony con un cavallo muto 

E al loro Dio perdente non credere mai 

E fu nella notte della lunga stella con la coda 
Che trovammo mio nonno crocifisso sulla chiesa 
Crocifisso con forchette che si usano a cena 
Era sporco e pulito di sangue e di crema 

E al loro Dio goloso non credere mai 

E forse avevo diciott'anni e non puzzavo più di serpente 
Possedevo una spranga un cappello e una fionda 
E una notte di gala con un sasso a punta 
Uccisi uno smoking e glielo rubai 

E al Dio della scala non credere mai 

Poi tornammo in Brianza per l'apertura della caccia al bisonte 
Ci fecero l'esame dell'alito e delle urine 
Ci spiegò il meccanismo un poeta andaluso 
""Per la caccia al bisonte"" disse ""Il numero è chiuso""

E a un Dio a lieto fine non credere mai 

Ed ero già vecchio quando vicino a Roma a Little Big Horn

Dei fratelli tutte blu che seppellirono le asce 
Ma non fumammo con lui non era venuto in pace

Che ho scaricato la mia rabbia in un teatro di posa 
Che ho imparato a pescare con le bombe a mano 
Che mi hanno scolpito in lacrime sull'arco di Traiano

in una delle molte feritoie della notte
con un bisogno d'attenzione e d'amore
troppo, ""Se mi vuoi bene piangi ""
per essere corrisposti,
valeva la pena divertirvi le serate estive
con un semplicissimo ""Mi ricordo"":
per osservarvi affittare un chilo d'erba
ai contadini in pensione e alle loro donne
e regalare a piene mani oceani
ed altre ed altre onde ai marinai in servizio,
fino a scoprire ad uno ad uno i vostri nascondigli
senza rimpiangere la mia credulità:
perché già dalla prima trincea
ero più curioso di voi,
ero molto più curioso di voi.

E poi sospeso dai vostri ""Come sta""
meravigliato da luoghi meno comuni e più feroci,
tipo ""Come ti senti amico, amico fragile,
se vuoi potrò occuparmi un'ora al mese di te""
""Lo sa che io ho perduto due figli""
""Signora lei è una donna piuttosto distratta.""
E ancora ucciso dalla vostra cortesia
nell'ora in cui un mio sogno
ballerina di seconda fila,
agitava per chissà quale avvenire
il suo presente di seni enormi
e il suo cesareo fresco,
pensavo è bello che dove finiscono le mie dita
debba in qualche modo incominciare una chitarra.

E poi seduto in mezzo ai vostri arrivederci,
mi sentivo meno stanco di voi
ero molto meno stanco di voi.

Potevo stuzzicare i pantaloni della sconosciuta

Potevo chiedere ad uno qualunque dei miei figli
di parlare ancora male e ad alta voce di me.
Potevo barattare la mia chitarra e il suo elmo
con una scatola di legno che dicesse perderemo.
Potevo chiedervi come si chiama il vostro cane
Il mio è un po' di tempo che si chiama Libero.
Potevo assumere un cannibale al giorno
per farmi insegnare la mia distanza dalle stelle.
Potevo attraversare litri e litri di corallo
per raggiungere un posto che si chiamasse arrivederci.

Fabrizio De André,"All'ombra dell'ultimo sole 
s'era assopito un pescatore 
e aveva un solco lungo il viso
come una specie di sorriso.

Venne alla spiaggia un assassino
due occhi grandi da bambino
due occhi enormi di paura
eran gli specchi di un'avventura.

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, .....

E chiese al vecchio ‘Dammi il pane,
ho poco tempo e troppa fame'
e chiese al vecchio ‘Dammi il vino,
ho sete e sono un assassino'.

Gli occhi dischiuse il vecchio al giorno
non si guardò neppure intorno
ma versò il vino e spezzò il pane 
per chi diceva ‘Ho sete, ho fame'.

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, .....

E fu il calore di un momento
poi via di nouvo verso il vento
davanti agli occhi ancora il sole
dietro le spalle un pescatore.

Dietro le spalle un pescatore
e la memoria è già dolore
è già il rimpianto di un aprile
giocato all'ombra di un cortile.

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, .....

Vennero in sella due gendarmi
vennero in sella con le armi
chiesero al vecchio se lì vicino 
fosse passato un assassino.

Ma all'ombra dell'ultimo sole 
s'era assopito il pescatore 
e aveva un solco lungo il viso

Fabrizio De André,"Stelle, già dal tramonto, 
si contendono il cielo a frotte, 
luci meticolose 
nell'insegnarti la notte. 

Un asino dai passi uguali, 
compagno del tuo ritorno, 
scandisce la distanza 
lungo il morire del giorno. 

Ai tuoi occhi, il deserto, 
una distesa di segatura, 
minuscoli frammenti 
della fatica della natura. 

Gli uomini della sabbia 
hanno profili da assassini, 
rinchiusi nei silenzi 
d'una prigione senza confini. 

Odore di Gerusalemme, 
la tua mano accarezza il disegno 
d'una bambola magra, 
intagliata del legno. 

""La vestirai, Maria, 
ritornerai a quei giochi 
lasciati quando i tuoi anni 
erano così pochi."" 

E lei volò fra le tue braccia 
come una rondine, 
e le sue dita come lacrime, 
dal tuo ciglio alla gola, 
suggerivano al viso, 
una volta ignorato, 
la tenerezza d'un sorriso, 
un affetto quasi implortato. 

E lo stupore nei tuoi occhi 
salì dalle tue mani 
che vuote intorno alle sue spalle, 
si colmarono ai fianchi 
della forma precisa 
d'una vita recente, 
di quel segreto che si svela 
quando lievita il ventre. 

E a te, che cercavi il motivo 
d'un inganno inespresso dal volto, 
lei propose l'inquieto ricordo 
fra i resti d'un sogno raccolto.",Il Ritorno Di Giuseppe
Fabrizio De André,"Tito: 
""Non avrai altro Dio all'infuori di me, 
spesso mi ha fatto pensare: 
genti diverse venute dall'est 
dicevan che in fondo era uguale. 

Credevano a un altro diverso da te 
e non mi hanno fatto del male. 
Credevano a un altro diverso da te 
e non mi hanno fatto del male. 

Non nominare il nome di Dio, 
non nominarlo invano. 
Con un coltello piantato nel fianco 
gridai la mia pena e il suo nome: 

ma forse era stanco, forse troppo occupato, 
e non ascoltò il mio dolore. 
Ma forse era stanco, forse troppo lontano, 
davvero lo nominai invano. 

Onora il padre, onora la madre 
e onora anche il loro bastone, 
bacia la mano che ruppe il tuo naso 
perché le chiedevi un boccone: 

quando a mio padre si fermò il cuore 
non ho provato dolore. 
Quanto a mio padre si fermò il cuore 
non ho provato dolore. 

Ricorda di santificare le feste. 
Facile per noi ladroni 
entrare nei templi che rigurgitan salmi 
di schiavi e dei loro padroni 

senza finire legati agli altari 
sgozzati come animali. 
Senza finire legati agli altari 
sgozzati come animali. 

Il quinto dice non devi rubare 
e forse io l'ho rispettato 
vuotando, in silenzio, le tasche già gonfie 
di quelli che avevan rubato: 

ma io, senza legge, rubai in nome mio, 
quegli altri nel nome di Dio. 
Ma io, senza legge, rubai in nome mio, 
quegli altri nel nome di Dio. 

Non commettere atti che non siano puri 
cioè non disperdere il seme. 
Feconda una donna ogni volta che l'ami 
così sarai uomo di fede: 

Poi la voglia svanisce e il figlio rimane 
e tanti ne uccide la fame. 
Io, forse, ho confuso il piacere e l'amore: 
ma non ho creato dolore. 

Il settimo dice non ammazzare 
se del cielo vuoi essere degno. 
Guardatela oggi, questa legge di Dio, 
tre volte inchiodata nel legno: 

guardate la fine di quel nazzareno 
e un ladro non muore di meno. 
Guardate la fine di quel nazzareno 
e un ladro non muore di meno. 

Non dire falsa testimonianza 
e aiutali a uccidere un uomo. 
Lo sanno a memoria il diritto divino, 
e scordano sempre il perdono: 

ho spergiurato su Dio e sul mio onore 
e no, non ne provo dolore. 
Ho spergiurato su Dio e sul mio onore 
e no, non ne provo dolore. 

Non desiderare la roba degli altri 
non desiderarne la sposa. 
Ditelo a quelli, chiedetelo ai pochi 
che hanno una donna e qualcosa: 

nei letti degli altri già caldi d'amore 
non ho provato dolore. 
L'invidia di ieri non è già finita: 
stasera vi invidio la vita. 

Ma adesso che viene la sera ed il buio 
mi toglie il dolore dagli occhi 
e scivola il sole al di là delle dune 
a violentare altre notti: 

io nel vedere quest'uomo che muore, 
madre, io provo dolore. 
Nella pietà che non cede al rancore, 
madre, ho imparato l'amore"".",Il Testamento di Tito

""Tito, non sei figlio di Dio, 
ma c'è chi muore nel dirti addio"". 

Madre di Dimaco: 
""Dimaco, ignori chi fu tuo padre, 
ma più di te muore tua madre"". 

Le due madri: 
""Con troppe lacrime piangi, Maria, 
solo l'immagine d'un'agonia: 
sai che alla vita, nel terzo giorno, 
il figlio tuo farà ritorno: 
lascia noi piangere, un po' più forte, 
chi non risorgerà più dalla morte"". 

Madre di Gesù: 
""Piango di lui ciò che mi è tolto, 
le braccia magre, la fronte, il volto, 
ogni sua vita che vive ancora, 
che vedo spegnersi ora per ora. 

Figlio nel sangue, figlio nel cuore, 
e chi ti chiama - Nostro Signore -, 
nella fatica del tuo sorriso 
cerca un ritaglio di Paradiso. 

Per me sei figlio, vita morente, 
ti portò cieco questo mio ventre, 
come nel grembo, e adesso in croce, 
ti chiama amore questa mia voce.

t'avrei ancora per figlio mio"".",Tre Madri

Fabrizio De André,"Quanti cavalli hai tu seduto alla porta 
Tu che sfiori il cielo col tuo dito più corto

La notte fa benissimo a meno del tuo concerto

Ed un oceano verde dietro le spalle 
Disse Vorrei sapere, quanto è grande il verde 
Come è bello il mare, quanto dura una stanza 
È troppo tempo che guardo il sole, mi ha fatto male 

Prova a lasciare le campane al loro cerchio di rondini

Fabrizio De André,"Mio padre aveva un sogno comune 
Condiviso dalla sua generazione 
La mascella al cortile parlava 
Troppi morti lo hanno tradito 
Tutta gente che aveva capito. 

E il bambino nel cortile sta giocando 
Tira sassi nel cielo e nel mare 
Ogni volta che colpisce una stella 
Chiude gli occhi e si mette a sognare 
Chiude gli occhi e si mette a volare

E I cavalli a Salò sono morti di noia 
A giocare col nero perdi sempre 
Mussolini ha scritto anche poesie 
I poeti che strade creature 
Ogni volta che parlano è una truffa

Ma mio padre è un ragazzo tranquillo 
La mattina legge molti giornali 
È convinto di avere delle idee 
E suo figlio è una nave pirata 
E suo figlio è una nave pirata

E anche adesso è rimasta una scritta nera 
Sopra il muro davanti casa mia 
Dice che il movimento vincerà 
Il gran capo ha la faccia serena 
La cravatta intonata alla camicia

Ma il bambino nel cortile si è fermato 
Si è stancato di seguire gli aquiloni 
Si è seduto tra I ricordi vicini I rumori lontani 
Guarda il muro e si guarda le mani 
Guarda il muro e si guarda le mani 
Guarda il muro e si guarda le mani",Le Storie Di Ieri

Had a dream just as plain as you and I
Saw the morning sun on a woodland in the spring

You and I  we were wearing Southern grey
I called to you, but I used another name

Once I was a stone many years ago
Into a pool was thrown many years ago.
Time passed by, the pool ran dry, excavated was i.
And tempered and beat in a fiery heat,
By the hand of a man, who's name was dan
Dan the blacksmith.

Once I was a sword, many years ago.
And my blade was broad, many years ago.
Worn with pride, into battle I'd ride at a warrior's side.
And I cut and I killed and was lost in a field,
And I soon did rust, corrode to dust,
Oh my.

Once I was a daisy, many years ago.
In pastures green and lazy, many years ago.
But I was et by a goat who fell in a moat and forgetting to float
He sunk like a lead and stayed until dead,
But was relieved to find just how kind it all was.

Once I was a grub, many years ago.
I lived in muck and mud, many years ago.
But on the very first noon I became a cocoon that resembled a prune.
When the good lord was done in the warmth of the sun.
I shed my skins, and dried my wings, and I flew away.

Once I was a bullfrog, had to struggle for survival.
And once I was a carp and lived in waters ornamental.
And once I was a myna bird, quoting verses from the bible,
Said ""pretty boy, pretty boy, st. luke"".

Once I was a mule, a many years ago.
But my master treat me cruel, a many years ago.
By and by I was sick, couldn't move to his kick, so he took out a stick
And hit it right 'cross my back to an almighty crack,
And to his dismay, I passed away, into the blue.

I was born a human baby, many years ago.
I was born unto a lady, many years ago.
All our hopes they were piled on the back of a child that turned out to be wild.
Sent the devil a prayer and caused the parson to swear.
So I took my leave to lie and thieve my way to jail.

I've been tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor.
I've known good times and disaster.

Faces,"There was a wicked messenger
From Eli he did come
With a mind that multiplied
The smallest matter

When questioned who had sent for him
He answered with his thumb
For his tongue it could not speak
But only flatter

He stayed behind the assembly hall
It was there that he made his bed
Often times he could be seen returning

Until one day he just appeared
With a note in his hand which read
""The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning""

The leaves began to fallin'
And the seas began to part
And the people that confronted him were many

The leaves began to fallin'
And the seas began to part
And the people that confronted him were many
And he was told these last few words
Which opened up his heart
""If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any""

""If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any""
And opened up his heart",Wicked Messenger

I try to do without you

Troubled times of pain that come
I take them any old day.

On a hilltop so high and show my face to the sky?
Will I find just what it is I'm looking for?

On the matter concerning my dress
I was raised in a clinic down in Oklahoma
There were many things I did not possess
I never complained because my father said
""Son, you'll get your chance before you're my age""
Then he took me upstairs and gave me this suit
Written all over his face

He said, ""others may come and the others may go
But that suit will be around wherever you're goin'""
Three button hand me down
Three button hand me down

Now I had my fair share of these women
But they came between me and my suit
There was a filly from Boston, a barmaid from Houston
Not forgetting the one in Detroit
They said, ""we like you, boy, and we think you're sweet
But can't you lose your suit?""
I said, ""no, no, no, no, you can't do that to me""
I remember what my father said

He said, ""others may come and the others may go
But that suit will be around wherever you're goin'""
Three button hand me down, ha, ha
Three button hand me down

I've never been a tidy dresser
And the fold in my trousers, it ain't straight
Still, I know a good cloth when I see one
That's why I'm clad in this gray flannel suit

Sometimes I wonder if I should visit a tailor
And get myself a smooth outfit
Then I remember what my father said to me
I'll make you from the open road, you all know this

He said, ""others may come and the others may go
But that suit'll be around wherever you go"", c'mon

It's late September and

You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone.

Really shows your age.
But that don't worry me none.
In my eyes, you're everything.

All I needed was a friend
To lend a guiding hand.
But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover!
You wore me out.
All you did was wreck my bed,
And, in the morning, kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone.
You stole my heart. I couldn't leave you if I tried.

I suppose I could collect my books
And get on back to school.
Or steal my daddy's cue
And make a living out of playing pool.
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band
That needs a helping hand.

Fact,"After all, a delusion is just a poor scenario

The story made by someone
A fool's imagination is, a carbon copy of me
I stand in front of the mirror, pretending to be calm
Then I pretend to be blind
I take a deep breath without a thought
I take a deep breath, remind myself
I ask again

What is the truth?
The truth in this world?
Find the truth in your heart

If I close my eyes, I would see it
Closing my eyes, I believe so deeply
Closing my eyes, memory is formed

Is my memory real?
Is my memory made by someone else?
Am I exploited by an invisible me

I will rise and take back myself again

I find again
I ask again
""Am I just myself?""
""I am just myself""",Rise
Fact,"Everything doesn't go well, as I'd hope
Walking along the broken glass with bare feet
We will get tired, if we turn around whenever, we stop to resist
You must not want anything

I'm so simple, why can't you understand me?
It's easy 'cause you construct the shape of my words
Into forms, into words, I love you

Shut the door you opened,
Because I do not chase fools you say, I will walk to the station
Smoke rises to the sky after the rain
The cry of respect wraps around my head

When the second hand makes a move, let me forget everything

However far you are
Don't show me your tears
Believing in only me
Sadness is separation
However far you are
Don't show me your tears
Believing in only me
Loneliness is meeting
Sadness is separation

I believe I found the way to go another day
And knew I was looking at the future
Nothing was on the way",Why...

Leche con galletas y yo dentro del pijama

El salón en la penumbra

Que ya he vuelto, que si que si que si
Que a tu lado como un crio

Que a tu lado lo rizo, a tu lado la crema
A tu lado lo subo, lo elevo, lo asciendo
Lo vuelo y lo planeo
Peinando las nubes

Los viejos sonríen desde las terrazas
Los niños te agarran por la falda y gritan
""¡Juani la más guapa, es la más bonita!""

Suenan los tambores y todos los móviles
Pierden cobertura por la criatura

Entre la paciencia y el nervio avanzaban
La castañera pelaba boniatos
Y un olor a carbón invadía las calles

Que sigilosamente andaban
Cantaban los pájaros su despedida
Otoño había llegado y con él
La melancolía del verano

La gente bajaba a los túneles
Envueltos por viento
Que subía corriendo escaleras
Perseguido por metro

Que cada tres minutos vaciaba los andenes
Y así la familia metro al completo
Transportaba a la gente de hogar al trabajo
Y del trabajo al calor del hogar, continuamente

Recuerdo, andaba tras pasado
Y presente su hermana melancolía caminaba
Dulce y amarga, pasado tras presente eternamente

Y futuro al frente misterioso y enigmático
Siempre con permiso de tiempo
Sinónimo de cambios y soplaban vientos

Por fin llegó la primavera y los niños amapola
La música triste se llenó de color
Y la ciudad entera salió a las calles a saludar a sol

Los días se alargaron y con ellos perdió
El sentido esta canción, gris y desencantada
Hasta el próximo invierno hermanos y hermanas

Te miro de reojo, sí, sigues a mi lado

El aire por tu pelo, estrellas en el cielo
La luna tras las nubes vuelve a aparecer
Importa el movimiento, tú vives lo que siento

El mundo se ha parado, Dios cogió un pincel
Decide que el momento será inmortalizado

Muchos dejaran sus huellas
Bien pegadas al asfalto, hoy salto alto
Mi rutina es gloria, me tiré de la noria

Lo intento porque siento
Porque vivo en movimiento
En busca del momento mediante la constancia

En la casa, en la almohada
En el alba de la mañana
Todos renaceremos un millón de veces

Y la suerte compadece cada instante
Ese perfume se convierte en diferente

Faf Larage,"C'EST PAS MA FAUTE
Mes origines sont floues
Ne me demande pas si j'en ai
Respecte mon silence
Car si je l'ouvre c'est cramé
J'ai pas d'papiers la vérité
Soi-disant né pour servir et protéger
La cruauté des hommes m'a abusé
Oui j'suis un clando
J'ai fais mes classes dans l'Est
À la dure ou des filles trop jeunes
Se vendaient pour mon maître
Sexe, violence j'ai connu que ça
J'ai renvoyé beaucoup d'gens au trépas
Même si j'aimais pas ça
Puis on m'a arrêté, détenu, vendu
On m'a trop souillé
Par toutes sortes d'individus
C'est pas ma faute, ma nature est comme ça
Moi je suis juste un objet qui fait peur
C'est pas ma faute, moi
Si l'on est fasciné par ma force
Je suis juste un objet qui fait peur
Je suis juste un objet qui fait oh
C'est pas ma faute, moi
Si l'on est fasciné par ma force
Pourquoi ?
Je suis juste un objet qui fait peur
Je suis juste un objet qui fait oh
J'aurai voulu être une arme de fonction
Qu'on me soigne, qu'on m'utilise avec attention
Fréquenter les stands de tirs, le beau monde
Au lieu d'ça j'suis arrivé en France en camion
Dans un carton j'ai vu que ma vie ne serait pas un conte
Saisi comme une merde avec des contrefaçons
Jeté au placard avec d'autres, c'est drôle
Chacun a son histoire aussi dramatiques les unes que les autres
Colle ce calibre 9 mm, jure que la femme de son maître
S'est elle-même tiré dans la tête, puis elle fatiguait le vieux fusil
Qu'a ? un cas jure que c'était une chèvre ou une caille

Putain y'a aussi mon compagnon de CSI un silencieux du milieu
À son actif au moins vingt à trente victimes
Et on a l'amnésique semi automatique
Trouvé au fond de l'eau dans un état critique
Et le chromé le bourg' qu'a trop traîné dans la poudre
Jure qu'il a des amis en haut lieu
Et qu'son affaire va se résoudre
On est tous là à espérer une sortie
Je rêve de jouer dans un film ou une série
Je voudrais ne plus être un objet qui fait peur

Et puis un jour on nous a sortis
On s'y attendait plus, endormis
Cachés dans un sac, tranquilles
Je sais qu'on allait être achetés à bas prix
Y'a l'fusil qui panique qui veut pas
Faire la guerre en Afrique
Nous c'est la loterie, la loi du trafic
On n'est pas un lot de bijouterie
J'ai pas fini autour du cou
D'un people sous ectasy
Mais dans les mains d'un môme de vingt piges
Jusqu'à cette descente de flics
Où ils m'ont sorti de en dessous du lit
Où j'ai vu mes semblables pointer le p'tit
Ni vi ni connu on m'a mis avec le gib'
J'ai attendu le placard
Mais on m'a vendu à une fille
Elle était pas d'ici
Comme moi étrangère en exil
Et elle m'a plue
Elle était si fragile

Fafá de Belém,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Poeira de Estrelas

E lá se foi, pra nunca mais
Linha nova que pai comprou

Não fique triste, menino
A linha é tão fácil de arranjar
Venha aqui, venha escolher
Papagaio de toda cor

A casa estava escura
No vento forte, a chuva desabou
A luz não vem, eu aqui estou

Tell me why should I even care
If I have to lose your love
From now on
You're only someone that I used to love

Yet it wasn't enough for you
All the love I had to give
I did my best to keep you satisfied
I guess you'll never know how much I tried
I really tried

And if ever our paths should cross again
Well, You won't find me being the one 
Who gets lost
Once I had so much to give
But You just refused my love

Que me incendeia o corpo de alegria
Lá vem a santa maldita euforia
Que me alucina, me joga e me rodopia

Lá vem o canto, o berro de fera
Lá vem a voz de qualquer primavera
Lá vem a unha rasgando a garganta
A fome, a fúria, o sangue que já se levanta

De onde vem essa coisa tão minha
Que me aquece e me faz carinho?
De onde vem essa coisa tão crua
Que me acorda e me põe no meio da rua?

É um lamento, um canto mais puro
Que me ilumina a casa escura
É minha força, é nossa energia
Que vem de longe prá nos fazer companhia

É Clementina cantando bonito
As aventuras do seu povo aflito
É Seu Francisco, boné e cachimbo
Me ensinando que a luta é mesmo comigo

Só precisa de uma sombra pra chegar

Mas de repente a velocidade chora
Não vejo a hora de voltar pra casa
A luz do teu olhar no fim do túnel
E no espelho a minha solidão

O céu da ilusão que não se acaba
A música do vento que não para
Será que a luz do meu destino vai te encontrar

Vejo a manhã de sol entrando em casa
Iluminando os gritos das crianças
Os momentos mais bonitos da lembrança
Não vão se apagar

E lavar minh'alma

Mas eu disfarço o meu ciúme mesmo assim
Pois aprendi que o meu silêncio vale mais
E desse jeito eu vou trazer você pra mim

E como um prêmio, eu recebo o teu abraço
Subornando o meu desejo tão antigo
E fecho os olhos, para todos os teus passos
Me enganando, só assim somos amigos

Por quantas vezes, me da raiva te querer
Em concordar com tudo que você me faz
Já fiz de tudo pra tentar te esquecer
Falta coragem pra dizer que nunca mais

Nos somos cumplices, nos dois somos culpados
No mesmo instante em que teu corpo toca o meu
Já não existe nem o certo nem o errado

I promise I will kill you right now

You could fill up a lake
With the tears of a crocodile
You lead by the nose and always get lost
(I cannot wait for the earthquake)
We always get lost
(to bury me in a cold grave)

Get outta this town
Hatchet men yelling timber
Will get us chopped down
Get outta this hell
Off this rusted train track
You still take lying down

So swing us around
While you're armed to the tooth
Keep yourself in the dark
Of some deep cobalt blue
So swing us around
By the skin of your teeth
Writing us off in invisible ink
So swing us around
While you're armed to the tooth
Keep yourself in the dark
Of some deep cobalt blue
So swing us around
By the skin of your teeth
Writing us off in invisible ink

You can still find me
Between devils and deep blue seas
In the desert's hands
On a sheet of sand
A dry tidal wave
Over my feet of clay
On unfinished glass
Looking for greener grass

Trying to make the welkin ring
But all my sounds are boomerangs

Yeah, where did you go?
I promise I will kill you right now
Oh, where did you go?
Bring a match while you feather your nest
Yeah, where did you go?
I promise you I will kill you right now

Not today, not again
Dress it up in stolen silver and garbage
Not today, not again
Dress it up in stolen silver and garbage
Not today, not again

Fair Warning,"So here we are - just you and me
Love's refugees again.
Girl, it's been so long
But still you are so close
I guess the way we're feeling
Still remained the same.

so there they are - the memories
Bringing back the dreams we learned to hide
And as we're looking back
Love is walking by
Leaving just a blossom
For all the tears we cried.

take me up - just for one more time
High above the shadows, of those long, lonely nights
Hold me tight - just for one more time
'till the new morning's breaking.

two burning hearts - that's all we are
Turning back the time for just one night.
But as we're moving on
All our dreams remain
Like a secret promise
Before we said goodbye

take me up - just for one more time
High above the shadows, of those long, lonely nights
Hold me tight - just for one more time
'till the new morning's breaking.

- guitar solo -

take me up - just for one more time
High above the shadows, of those long, lonely nights
Hold me tight - just for one more time
'till the new morning's breaking.

'till the new morning's breaking.

'till the new morning light...



",Take Me Up
Fair Warning,"The morning light has left you, 
There's no sign where to go
You've lost your way to Eden but you can't let it show
Somewhere in the distance the vision fades away
Of where your life is leading of all the better ways

In the night you find yourself alone

Remember when you started everything was clear
The road that lay before you, solution seemed so near
Then you got elected, you still can hear the cheers
Someone who will save us to take away the tears

In the night you find yourself alone
Tell me why do you live a lie
You are acting blind

Tell me what did you find now you're out in the cold
Does your promise still hold
And what did you do, you find yourself telling lies
While a million hungry eyes are watching you

Some men would do anything to keep their golden crown
Are you really one of them, are you laughing at the crowd?
You close your eyes to all the things you once believed were true
And say I would forgive you if I would wear your shoes

In the night you find yourself alone
Tell me why do you live a lie
You are acting blind

Tell me what did you find now you're out in the cold
Does your promise still hold
And what did you do, you find yourself telling lies
While a million hungry eyes are watching you

Repeat Chorus",What Did You Find
Fair Warning,"The wind of the west ? it whispers and calls
A dirge to the still of night
I'm lying awake ? and sorrow is on my mind

'Cause baby, I know ? we must make a move
This world's running out of time
There's a force that keeps pushing me on
I can feel it inside ?

This burning heart ? sets my soul on fire
And the power of hope is rising up through my veins
This burning heart ? drives my souls desire
Time and time again

A world in a daze ? in fear and confused

Is rising before my eye
We run from the truth ? too blind for signs of time

There's a vision of justice and peace
Living on in our souls
There must be a way better than this
And I'm longing to go

This burning heart ? sets my soul on fire
And the power of hope is rising up through my veins
This burning heart ? drives my souls desire
Time and time again

This burning heart ? sets my soul on fire
And the power of hope is rising up through my veins
This burning heart ? drives my souls desire
Time and time again",Burning Heart [Live]
Fair Warning,"Another sleepless night
Paradise drifts out of sight
You find yourself on a street to nowhere

And you found talk is cheap
And promises not made to keep
You can't go on and pretend you don't care

By now you realize
Change's a faithful guide
And it will take you through flood tide
(Come let your sun rise)

Forever we will change
Forever we will learn
As long as time turns
As long as love burns
Forever

Don't mind to rearrange
For you never can return
To these shores to save
From all stormy waves
Forever

And hate won't take control
Do closely listen to your soul
No rest no sleep till the answer is near

You chase the rainbows end
A virtue you may will defend
'Cause each day will take you to a new frontier

By now you realize
Change's a faithful guide
And it will take you through flood tide
(Come let your sun rise)

Forever we will change
Forever we will learn
As long as time turns
As long as love burns

Fair Warning,"Now you know you cannot stay
For you made up your mind
To go the stony long way
Change you must I hear you say
Did you learn how to fight
To make your way through these days
And now you pray
For a miracle to come
Now you say
Take me to the promised land
Heart on the run
Alone in the night
You're trying to find
Some shelter from pain
Heart on the run
How can you survive
As long as you won't face the truth
You will cry in vain
Started out not to return
It's a long way to go
When there's a lesson to learn
So don't you pray
For a miracle to come
Say you will
And meet me in the promised land
Heart on the run
Alone in the night
Just trying to find
Some shelter from pain
Heart on the run
Sure you will survive
As long as you will face the truth
You don't cry in vain
[repeat bridge and chorus]",Heart on the Run
Fair Warning,"Riots on the misty roads of night
Faces carved in ignorance and pride

Looking for another way
Trouble's down the street
The sky's on fire - I'm moving on
I got to face the heat

I fight - when silence breaks at night
I fight - no mercy in these eyes
And if my love is strong enough,
I got to break this pride -
I fight - I fight...

Castles built on anger and desire
Waymarks in a no man's land on fire

Looking for a different life
Longing for the day
And all I know's - I must get out
I got to find my way

I fight - when silence breaks at night
I fight - no mercy in these eyes
And if my love is strong enough,
I got to break this pride -
I fight - I fight...
