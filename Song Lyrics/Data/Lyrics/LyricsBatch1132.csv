Bad Manners,"Wet winter left me cold and crying, 
Beaten black and blue, 
Someone said there's no harm in trying, 
Nothing else to do. 

I'm just a-walking in the sunshine, 
Leave your troubles all behind you, 
I think I'll drink a little red wine, 
I'll take you where they'll never find you. 

Sad songs, well I've heard to many, 
Words that didn't rhyme, 
Long years never had a penny, 
But we spend the time. 

Just a-walking in the sunshine, 
Try to keep from going under, 
I think I'll drink a little red wine, 
Ain't no use to sit and wonder. 

As I would say? 

Autumn eve and the leaves are falling, 
'Till the trees are bare, 
Summer's gone I can hear you calling, 
Haven't got a care. 

Just a-walking in the sunshine, 
Leave your troubles behind you, 
I think I'll drink a little red wine, 
I'll take you where they'll never find you.

Bad Manners,"I told you and I thought you said you understood.
It never stays inside your head, is it made of wood?
I talk and talk all night,
I never get it right,
I never make it clear?
Even I am screaming in my dreams,
But no one seems to hear

I'm-a weeping,
I'm-a wailing,
My life is so frustrating
I'm-a weeping,
I'm-a wailing,
My life is so frustrating

So many people everyday, I have to meet
So many things I have to say, stay incomplete
I try to be so nice,
Listen to bad advice,
Thinking all the while
I'm so angry I just want to shout
But behind the smile,

Don't dabble with controversy they're telling me
Make sure you don't offend the BBC
Just try and keep it clean, Don't make it too obscene 
'cause if you do you'll land in trouble
Please excuse me if I heave a sigh
It makes me wanna cry

So frustrating, so frustrating, my life is so frustrating 
I'm a weeping, I'm a wailing, my life is so frustrating,
I;m a weeping, I'm a wailing, my life is so frustrating.",Weeping and Wailing

Lorraine, she took everything
Even my brand new engagement ring
She took the car and went to town
But now she can only be found

Lorraine punched me on the nose, so I slapped her round the head
Then we talked the whole thing out, and went straight to bed

And now I've found her, don't want to kill her 
And now I've found her, don't want to kill her 
And now I've found her, don't want to kill her

I never thought she would wind up dead
She never meant to take her life
She went too far this time with a knife

Don't you know that she's a suicide?
Don't you know that she's a suicide?

No one saw inside her head
All they wanted was a body in bed
She worked with people all of the time
She watched her lolly, she lost her mind

Bad Meets Evil,"Sometimes life seems so unfortunate,
That's why I don't give a shit
The poor stay poor, the rich get richer,
It's just so disproportionate
You don't know just what I've gone through,
That's why I would rather show you
Just how far that I can take it,
Every rule I'm breakin' it

Terrible, but not rippable, invincible, I'm hung invisible
Fuckin' mistletoe, over the wall to stuck my ass up under it
Now pucker up them lips and kiss it ho, here we go
Bad and Evil, so you know how this'll go
The competition's miserable, we stomp them bitches, this is no,
Joke goin' overboard, like someone threw us off the boat, choke
Puff up all the smoke I'm tryna stay on fire
So you know if I hate fucking water-sprinklers, I don't love the hoes
Someone let the cat out the bag, now it's time to stuff his face
Back, then I smother that mothafucka 'til it suffocates
Who? You! Handlin' the over weight
Why are they tryin' to be so sick, when bad and evil has reunited, hey?
Came back to annihilate, the game's in dire straits, it's our way
Worlds Satan as I drop, ? Ouija board
Now you lay me down to sleep
I do this shit in my sleep, I'm sleepin' now, as if I was awake
I'm teared bitch, I'll never taste the canvas
Could never be no damn wuss or pussy, never mushy, so you can't squish
Never on my damn toosh, in fact if I jump out a bush
And sneak attack's the only was I say I ambush
Outlandish are these words and weapons that are Brandish
Stand off, it's the hoes, keep your hands off this
Can't tie a bitch, so what the fuck would I sugarcoat it for?
Law, fuck protocol, I'd holla at this ho, but now my throat is sore

Sometimes life seems so unfortunate,
That's why I don't give a shit
The poor stay poor, the rich get richer,
It's just so disproportionate
You don't know just what I've gone through,
That's why I would rather show you
Just how far that I can take it,
Every rule I'm breakin' it

Baby I'm lawless, you couldn't burn me if you threw acid on me
I'm at your homie, I'm at your home ready to spray you
Why you nappin' homie? Have everything on and around your mattress
Lookin' like the word in front of a matrimony, you hot, fuck yeah
Go 'head jump, no matter how high you get
You gon' come up short like Spud Webb
My DUI's get waved by saying bye
Still ridin' with no L's like James Tide, can't change I
I thank god for my safe thinking
Last time I was safe thinking, me and my niggas was doin' a bank job
I stay violent, y'all go the peace route
You got a mouth like Kanye, I knock your whole bottom row of teeth out
No disrespect to Mr. West, shit I'm just nice with mine
And this just rap, I'm just like Ricky Hatton, I just like the line
These sweet rappers wanna set us up, they never tough
They ask me for a hook, I tell 'em left to right, head or gut
What y'all messin' with is a nigga that'll leave you fubar
Fucked up beyond all recognition
Y'all are rock stars, I'm the opposite
I could just throw a rock and hit a star for the fuck of it
Partner, you not hard, I body your hot bars
Beef has left you prayin' right? Like Allahuakbar
Let's go, when I leave y'all shot, you ain't gon' be on your metro
In a bad area that car drops

Sometimes life seems so unfortunate,
That's why I don't give a shit
The poor stay poor, the rich get richer,
It's just so disproportionate
You don't know just what I've gone through,
That's why I would rather show you
Just how far that I can take it,
Every rule I'm breakin' it",Above the Law
Bad Meets Evil,"First verse, uh I'm on 'til I'm on a island
My life's ridin' on the Autobahn on autopilot
Before I touch dirt, I'll kill you all with kindness
I kill ya, my natural persona's much worse
You've been warned if you've been born or if you conform
Slap up a cop and then snatch him out of his uniform
Leave him with his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on
And hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn
Y'all niggas intellect mad slow, y'all fags know
Claimin' you bangin', you flamin'
Bet you could light your own cigarette witcha asshole
Me and Shady deaded the past,
So that basically resurrected my cash flow
I might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke
Though I ain't wrapped tight
My blood type's the eighties!
My nineties was like the Navy, you was like the Brady´s
You still fly kites daily!

Catch me in my Mercedes
Bumpin' ""Ice, Ice Baby,"" screamin' Shady 'til I die
Like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy
So I live it to the fullest 'til I'm Swayze
And you only live it once, so I'm thinkin' 'bout this nice, nice lady
Wait, no, stop me now before I get on a roll (danish)
Let me tell you what this pretty little dame's name is, 'cause she's kinda famous
And I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this
Nicki Minaj, but I wanna stick my penis in your anus!
You morons think that I'm a genius
Really I belong inside a dang insane asylum, cleanin', try them trailer parks
Crazy, I am back, and I am razor sharp, baby
And that's back with' a capital B with' an exclamation mark, maybe
You should listen when I flip the linguistics
'Cause I'm gonna rip this mystical slick shit
You don't wanna become another victim or statistic of this shit
'Cause after I spit the bullets, I'ma treat these shell casings like a soccer ball
I'ma kick the ballistics! So get this dick, I'ma live this

Livin' life in the fast lane
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank
But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now
I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride
Just gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal)
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal)

My whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit
At war with' a bottle, this Captain Morgan attacks my organs
My slow flow is euphoric, it's like I rap endorphins
I made a pact with the Devil that says ""I'll let you take me
You let me take this shovel, dig up the corpe of Jack Kevorkian""
Go 'back and forth in more beef that you can pack a fork in
I'm livin' the life of the infinite enemy down
My tenement, too many now, to send my serenity powers
Spin 'em around, enterin' in the vicinity

Now, was called Eminem, but he threw away the candy and ate the rapper
Chewed him up, and spitted him out
Girl, giddy-up, now get, get down
He's lookin' around this club and it looks like people are havin' a shit fit now
Here, little t-t-trailer trash, take a look who's back in t-t-town
Did I s-st-stutter, motherfucker? Fuck the mall, he shuts
The whole motherfuckin' Wal-mart d-d-down every time he comes a-r-r-round
And he came to the club tonight with five nine to hold this bitch down
Like a motherfuckin' chick underwater, he tryna d-dr-drown
Shawty, when you dance, you got me captivated
Just by the way that you keep lickin' them dicks like lips, I'm agitated, aggravated
To the point you don't suck my dick, then you're gonna get decapitated
Other words, you don't fuckin' give me head, then I'm have to take it

And then after takin' that, I'ma catch a case, it's gon' be fascinating
It's gon' say ""The whole rap game passed away"" on top of the affidavit
Graduated from master debater slash massive masturbator
To Michael Jackson' activator
Meanin' I'm on fire off the top, might wanna back up the data
Runnin' over hip-hop in a verbal tractor-trailer
Homie, this sick, you can normally ask a hater
Don't it make sense, these shell casings is just like a bag of paper
Dropped in the lap of a tax evader (Homie, they spent)

Now make that ass drop like a sack of potatoes
What, girl, I'm the crack-a-lator
Percolator to this party, be my penis ejaculator later
Tell your boyfriend that you just struck pay dirt
You rollin' with a player, you won't be exaggeratin' when you sayin'

Livin' life in the fast lane
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank
But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now
I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride

Grab the key up off the counter till the camp all left the crib
Man, who'd knew that three in the morning I'd still be up
Could barely see up over the steering wheel, crashed the whip, tore a tree up
On my way to the dealer's, tryna re-up
Call me Brett Favre, spell it F-A-V-R, E, yep
It's wrong, other words I just fucked my RV up
Bitch, it's on again yeah, break that Klonopin in half
While I smoke some chronic in the cab with Donovan McNabb
And I dye my hair back blond again and laugh

I'm the real macaroni you cheesy bitch, I'm demonic with the craft
There's a devil in my noodle, you angel hair pasta
Flows dreaded like some fucking tangled hair rasta
Farian, Jamaican, relax, man
I'll send a fucking axe at you if you insist on a fucking accent
Bad and Evil is back with an epidural, check ya girl
'cause after we prop you up, we propping her up
So, baby, come put ya feet up in these stirrups
Your boyfriend better find another fucking whore to smash the stir up
We rap like we're on

It's Eminem and him again, my sentiments exactly
I told that bitch to get at me, then the bitch attacked me
Kid you not, I'm lit up as fuck, tablecloth tucked in my pants
Then I'm hearing dishes drop, 'cause I walked away from my dinner with schmucks

Then I aimed to the front of the K-Mart shopping center
With' a coupon book and a hundred and ten bucks
And a bunch of change and wife beater with a mustard stain
I'll crush your brain like I'm crushing pills
What the fuck's the muthfuckin' deal?
This shit's making me feel like I'm tryna do a mothafuckin' cartwheel up a hill

How many bars, how many tabs?
A-c-i-d, y-e-s, 'cause I'm sniffin n-y-e-s
F-you-c-k'ed up, and it's obvious
Smoking Henny in my chest
I'm b-a-n-a-n-a-s
I'm a c-o-c-o-n-you-t

Put this CD in and then you'll see
The sequel to Scary Movie, bad is to evil,
the roofie to Roethlisberger
You are gonna wind up six feet deep
Under that shits creek so I hope that you brought preservers

You could put a turd on the plate
Silverware on the tablecloth to serve us
You don't bring shit to the table
I mean your grill like a Seville when a mark gets murdered
You pushing the envelope, and I'm shovin' that whole post office further
Right off the surface, to the serpents in the darkest and the farthest corner

How many bars, how many bars
Maui, wow wee, sour diesel, how many jars,
To all my people I'll be the Mars, mommy come on
She can actually wrap my nut sack 'round the back of her neck in a bathroom stall
And she can just puke from sipping this piss from my twenty four inch catheter cord

I'm the type that'll take a bath with' a whore
Drown her, bang her head on the passenger door
When I'm stashin' 'er in the back, smackin' her forehead on the dash
And its accidentally blowin', a Benz jeep horn

My friends be knowin' that when I'm on a binge, I'm stingy
Even when I'm ten deep in a room with the MG and and with' Lindsay Lohan and she on

Got her on the pole like the opposite of her papa's plan

I'm in the trance, looking at this bitch dance)
Looking at this tramp, like what you wearing girl, quit playing

Aw hell, Shady, he'll tell it like it is
So tell Katy Perry he's on the tail, he's tailgating
These bells are my maiden call and I'm here, bell's raiding and tell Lady

Wouldn't fuck her with her dick you heard, the verdict's in, he's allergic to D
Doesn't take me Clevis to him, him don't give a damn how Beaver doing

Three more chickadees and have a menage like Nikki
You hot like a Dickie outfit in Texas without shit under it, sweating
Suck my dick, or gets to steppin to my logic

My Patrick, my dick is as hard and thick as a yardstick
What we gonna do? Ride around 'til we're carsick
Then I'ma put this shit in park like dog shit
And you can blow me in the dark in the parking lot
Out of the trailer park by the garbage
What you waiting on? Me to roll up the carpet?
The condoms are in the glove compartment, let's start it
Think I'm joking? What, am I sitting here
Tryna make fake farts with my armpits?
Tryna get you to spit pop through your nose?
Am I here to amuse you? Stop it

I'm in your pocket outside of a church
The other hand reaching for the bottom of your purse
You giving me head in a boxing stance
My dick's so big you could drop it in dirt

There's five things you are in charge of, that's

If you ain't sucking a dick, why you sitting there
With puckered lips? Oh that's collagen, mothafucking bitch

I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you, I would duck, or get struck like lightening,
Fighters keep fighting, put your lighters up, point 'em' skyward uh
Had a dream I was king, I woke up, still king
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking,
Till nobody else even fucking feels me, till' it kills me
I swear to god I'll be the fucking illest in this music
There is or there ever will be, disagree?
Feel free, but from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
Only thing I ever gave up's using no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick but you cocks are slick

Who you dicks try to kid, flipped dick, you did the opposite
You stayed the same, 'cause cock backwards is still cock you pricks
I love it when I tell 'em shove it
Cause it wasn't that long ago when Marshall sat, luster lacked, lustered
'Cause he couldn't cut mustard, muster up nothing
Brain fuzzy, 'cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzz
Now you wonder why he does it, how he does it
Wasn't 'cause he had buzzards circle around his head
Waiting for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it, 'cause them bitches wrote him off
Little hussy ass buzzards, fuck it, guess it doesn't matter now, does it
What difference it make?
What it take to get it through your thick skulls
As if this ain't some bullshit
People don't usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in
Just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switch blade to a haters rib cage
And let it be known from this day forward
I wanna just say thanks 'cause your hate is what gave me the strength

I advance like going from toting iron
To going and buying four or five of the homies the iron man Audi
My daddy told me slow down, boy, you goin' to blow it
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute
To tell Shady I love him the same way that he did Dr.Dre on the Chronic
Tell him how real he is or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him for him to know it
I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I right
Till he can march right
Into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up

I'll stop when I'm at the very top

It's 'bout to be a scary drop

Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cats meow, ow
Classic cow, always down for the catch weight like Pacquiao

'Cause now I'm in the Aston
I went from having my city locked up
To getting treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
And now I'm fantastic
Compared to a weed high
And y'all niggas just gossipin' like bitches on a radio and TV
See me, we fly
Y'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams staring at a bee-hive
And how real is that
I remember signing my first deal
And now I'm the second best I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag

You and I know what it's like to be kicked down
Forced to fight, but tonight we're alright

Guess who, what's happening guys?

Would I be before I let another rapper think he's hot
I'll bury my face in his stinky twat and go ala la la la

Then I let you witness shit when it hit the ceiling
The niggas willing to give the listeners the sickest feeling
Like mixing some Benadryl and penicillin
Then I'm filling the clip with a written
Can you picture my pistol drilling?
A million women and children when I'm illing
But it isn't real, it's a rap
On the real, it's a wrap
How could you possibly stop the Apocalypse
When I'm atomic bombing the populous
Shock the metropolis hostile as a kid
Popping the Glock at his moms and his pops
Then he hops in his drop with his iPod rocking the Slaughterish
Documentation and lyrics I write with confidence
Write like a columnist slash novelist
I'm in this game to demolish, establish my dominance
Over prominent rappers you popping shit till you opposite
I can spit ominous so spit politics now
I'm Haile Selassie, Gandhi, and Pac of this hip hop genre,
Bitch!

Slaughterhouse!

Lyrically I'm a cocaine Altoid
Ability told brain it's a no brain bout boy
Physically I'm literally a cocaine cowboy
Wait wait, did I just go almost four bars
Without talking about my big dick?
The other day me and your thick bitch had a great day and we ate cake
And then we walked and then she tried to jack me off but she lost
Cause she couldn't handle my shit, wait I sweared
Irony of Ryan is I am bipolar
While I'm rhyming standing beside a big old white bear
Neither one of us fight fair,

With a white boy ain't got to jump no where 'cause I'm here

One, two I'm coming for you, I'm a big old (big old) nightmare!

After that I'll slap your ass again
And tell you to shut the fuck up shutting up

Men will assault you, time is a bastard symbol of sorter?
Kidnap your trembling daughter, at least a quarter

Normally something's wrong with me
Claiming a quantity of the porn I see on the pause to me

How the fuck are they gonna stop when I was born to be
Corner me, shit belong to me, two choices, you can get along with me
Or sit your fagot ass right there in dormancy
Wait, all you missing is heels to be Ru Paul

Stop and pick you some Maxi Pads up is that what you actually ask me?
Bitch reaches over and smacks me
And says I annoy the fuck outta her, get in the fucking back
Put on your slut powder, you slut, what? Shut the fuck up now
Or get your feelings hurt, worse than my last chick when
I accidentally butt dialed her, she heard me spreading AIDS rumors about her
Turn the radio up louder, make it thump
While I bump that Relapse CD, tryna hit every bump in that cunt
Thought I snap back in that accent cause she kept asking me
To quit callin' her cunt, I said I cunt, she said, Marshall

I said nah, I'm a walking Kanye Beyonce song
She said I'm mad at you, I said why?
She said why you never make songs for chicks as if it's hard to do?
I said I make songs for me, leave the studio
And go and fuck the bitch who belongs to who makin' songs for you

So I gave her dap and told her to scat, I'm not mean, I'm cute
On my way to the front door, taking the scenic route
To avoid this chick with a lace front lookin' like Venus and Serena's hooves
I'm just sayin', those chicks got horse asses, they been attractive
Hope when they see me they don't slap me with they tennis rackets
My mind drifted back to this shit
I seen my wife push her down, step over her body and smack the mistress
Police outside, I turn and pass the gat to Vicious
Then I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin
He mugs the mistress, turns around and gives the misses hugs and kisses
Looks at me twisted, like Nickel ""Yeah, watch this shit""
He smacks the dentures outta the mouth of the fat bitch he rode with
Looks back to mention, ""Royce, it's good to be back to business""

Feels like the shit just switched on me
Everything I do for the nigga, and the nigga know
I would do anything for him, but the nigga refuse
To just quit straight shittin' on me
Keepin' your distance?
Probably best if you don't wanna fuck with me
But you know me probably best, fuck pity
You want that? You know it's Leila Ali's chest
Tough titty, the problems,
You got a problem, you think that I'm already set
So I'm a look down on you?
Just be proud of me, you already got my respect
I ain't tryna say something I regret
So I'm a just stop, chasing the pain
Let you deal with the fact we don't get along
Cause I got a big face in the game
Sometimes I feel like fuck my life,
I fuck with a few niggas that I know that
If my chick was a Shady hoe
Niggas wouldn't think twice 'fore they fuck my wife
Guess that's the difference in friends and associates,
I done been broke, I done been through the motions
I don't pay no attention to birds,
I use my scope then I tend to the vultures
No one ever blows up your phone to talk,
I don't make money just to loan it to y'all

I live in a bubble, I struggle with the fame
Trouble as the pain grows double, give a fuck what you say
When my music you take so subtle, just to give it away
To people who don't even appreciate flows, mothafucka, I'm living today
Cause I break my back to give you my art, you steal my thoughts
It's like driving a spike through my heart
You might not think it's not that big of a deal to steal from me
But music is all I got
Aside from my daughters, not to sound like a martyr
But it's getting harder than I thought
To not just go crazy, trapped in this house, I'm about to just snap
And I might not deserving of what I got to, did I not work for it?
Put it all in every record I record
Well then please tell me why ?
But I wonder sometimes is it worth all the bullshit
'Cause it feels like a down there ain't no gettin' up from
But I won't let it get me down, I won't succumb, I'm anything but ? so fuck 'em
They'll appreciate me when I'm gone, they say it was ill, right?
The way I kill mics? But the way I feel right now
It just feels like I'm so done with this shit I might as well wipe
I have nothing else to give you, nothing left to contribute
Farewell I bid you, but before I go, my last gift to you

I'll be around as long as you let me get to you
Long as I got two balls to palm

Bruce Willis on his death bed
Last breath with an infection
Fightin' it while he's watching internet porn
About to meet his death with an erection
My god, what I mean is
David Carrideine jacking his penis in front of his tripod
Choking his own neck, what part you don't get?
I'm saying I die hard

When you listen to my bars, nothin' but the fire
Comin' out your iPod, we come up in a place
Chicks heads start spinning like motherfuckin' white walls

Got your mother suckin' my balls while we fuck each other 
Punch each other in the eyeballs

The last time the light kicked me in the ass
I pulled down it's pants and put a foot up its ass
Man what a catastrophe it'd be for me to be a bitch ass pussy
And not open a can of whoop ass
Did ya piss ass whoop me will be the day I say I ain't poop
Shit, the day that I don't straight shoot
I'll drop out of my anti-women hate group
Say I'm a sissy faggot, record it play it back and put it on straight loop
You haters look like you ate a grape fruit
You see me climbing back on that wagon
Got my swagga back I was dragging, hop back on it
Grab the reigns on that bastard and came back on em

Crumbling apart from pressure by the blaster, waiting for a sign

When you bite the dust, was it for purpose or for trust?

Stuck in side, but I am letting it out
I am struggling just to keep my poise
And I don't stop screamin' till I lose my voice
Keep on doing what I feel the most

Couldn't for get you
Everything was right
Knew I had to let you
Into my life
But the question was how
It all seems so clear looking back now
Back in '92 didn't have a clue
School bell ring sky clear blue
Get my ass home
Call you on the phone
You promise later on that night 
We be alone
Next five hours, don't think I sat
Took a trip to the store for a lubricated hat
Check my self in the mirror

You grabbed me by the hand

Went to put the Trojan on, shit, it had a hole

Some time around two o'clock
Girls can't wait for me to call 
So they can get this started
It's a daily operation
F train to my subway station
But I am still a virgin, babe
So lets stick, to masturbation

Remember shit, I am ready to go
Saw a girl I met at a show
Forgot her name
And she got mad
How could she miss what she never really had?
Got love from here to infinity
Loose control when she's in my vicinity
I want to take her home and show her I am a surgeon
Tell I love her
Then tell her I am a virgin

When I say goodbye, it'll be alright, alright, alright!
Now people let me tell you 'bout this girl Suzanne,
Met her at the bar and I was like god damn!
She didn't have a man, no drink in her hand,
Bought her a shot and took her back to the van.
She was tall, slim, and tan. A White Owl fan,
Asked if I would take part in some perverted plan?
She dropped her skirt, she had another head.

I've been wrapped up in different lies
I've been wrapped up, I've been untied

One more travel, the top of the mountain
Close your eyes, be patient, it's coming

To clear my mind
To try and figure out my brain
To confront and set aside my pain

'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad
'Round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings'
'Round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Till our love is safe and sound
And old midnight comes around
Feelin' sad
Really gets bad
Round, Round, Round Midnight",'Round About Midnight
Baden Powell,"Se não tivesse o amor
Se não tivesse essa dor
E se não tivesse o sofrer

E se não tivesse o chorar
Melhor era tudo se acabar
Melhor era tudo se acabar

Eu amei, amei demais
O que eu sofri por causa do amor
Ninguém sofreu

Eu chorei, perdi a paz
Mas o que eu sei
É que ninguém nunca teve mais
Mais do que eu

",Consolação
Baden Powell,"Être heureux, c'est plus ou moins ce qu'on cherche
J'aime rire, chanter et je n'empêche
Pas les gens qui sont bien d'être joyeux

Pourtant s'il est une samba sans tristesse
C'est un vin qui ne donne pas l'ivresse
Un vin qui ne donne pas l'ivresse, non

Ce n'est pas la samba que je veux

J'en connais que la chanson incommode
D'autres pour qui ce n'est rien qu'une mode
D'autres qui en profitent sans l'aimer
Moi je l'aime et j'ai parcouru le monde

En cherchant ses racines vagabondes
Aujourd'hui pour trouver les plus profondes
C'est la samba-chanson qu'il faut chanter

On m'a dit qu'elle venait de Bahia
Qu'elle doit son rythme et sa poésie à
Des siècles de danse et de douleur

Mais quels que soient les sentiments qu'elle exprime
Elle est blanche de formes et de rimes
Blanche de formes et de rimes
Elle est nègre, bien nègre, dans son cœur

Mais quelque soit le sentiment qu'elle exprime
Elle est blanche de formes et de rimes
Blanche de formes et de rimes
Elle est nègre, bien nègre, dans son cœur",Saravá

Hey hey, fisherman. Forget the world if that's your plan

As the morning turns to noon. He's content to sit and croon
And he lights his twisted pipe and settles down
Onward goes the time, as he tries new baited line
So he digs another worm up from the ground
Hey hey, fisherman, wish you luck that's all I can
Hey hey, fisherman, forget the world if that's your plan

Maybe tomorrow, I will love again
I'll never know until I've seen her once or twice

She thinks of paper green
You never hear them calling her name
They just know where they've been

You never hear her holler
The tears no longer come
She reads her daily book of the past
That shows of everyone

Grey years that show in her hair
Can't be, but don't seem to care
She unlocks the door and there's no one there

She sees a daytime stroller
Walk from the night before
And though she paints a smile on her face
He won't be back no more

She's got no saint to follow
She's got no place to go
Too proud to ask an old friend for help
Too proud to let him know

Can't be, but don't seem to care

Floating down the stream against the flow

Fate please show me to the edge of town
Don't blast me to the moon I'll still come down

Shadowed by the blister on your heart

All I need is perfect timing
To dodge these tumbleweeds around me
Listen to my senseless rhyming

Your scent is all I need
It makes me sneeze
This is how you find me
Just listen when I sneeze
Your scent is all I need

I don't think I ever felt so good.
When all I need is to be free,
Where I love you and you love me.
Follow the circle sur le plage,
On a mono-colored trip voyage.
This is the color of my word,
Stay watch me find another pearl.

Follow the gold leaf trail back where,
We were young and had no care.
Tracing the circles that we made,
I don't want to live a life in shade.
Will this be a desert or a beach,
Or a place to find the things we need.

Now you and I make up perfect things,
Watch me trade my wheels for wings.
But don't ever use those wings to fly
Just the essence of a lullaby
Now I am a giant grain of sand
But I may be slipping through your hand
Follow my color coded world
And watch be find another pearl

It's a sound that I love
And it came from above
These's the sound of the sea
Are you following me

Let's walk to the sound of distant shells
To a place where life would have no end
You'd be the mother of my pearls
If you follow me into my world
Back to a place where I'd be free
Where I'd love you and you'd love me
This is the color of my world
Go watch me find another pearl",Another Pearl

Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy

Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star

Then you see it happen again
The world turned over
Wouldn't it be something to live
Your Life On Mars
Or at least demanding
Of some kind of masquerade

I never never ever believed
In things uncertain
Hanging round the corner
Just when do you start doing time
In the case of I, my, me and mine
October Nineteen sixty nine

Where were you in Seventy Six
The long hot summer
You wanna be a rebel
Then turn your hosepipes on
With two years to wait
For the sound of Jilted John

Virginia Wade was winning our hearts
She made us want to live
Vicious and his brothers
Were trying to set us free
But much more than this to you and me
This was the Silver Jubilee

We made something out of nothing
A sense of loathing and belonging

Some of us were gonna be rich
With the Iron Lady
Lennon's gone already
Let's post the boys to war
Oh mother, what're you worrying for
It's somewhere he's not been before

Then you see the Union Jack
And it means nothing
But somehow you know
That you will find your own way
It's a small reminder every day
That I was born in the U.K.

More coins inside her hands
One time to learn respect

I'm no boy
Stealing pennies from the poor
Break it down

Time probably erased
Distaste and so she's left
Where guilt is out of place

What anyone says doesn't mean a thing

Just tell me you're feeling it
And you're not disbelieving it

I'll pay you in kind or silver and gold

I could help
You to breathe

And your smile so bright

Where you go I wanna go
What you do I wanna do

If you'll be my Sandra Dee

It's a trivial pursuit
But I know if I fall on my heart
I'll be with you
But please understand I am just a man
And I need you to take me home

We're together now
Wanna change my shoes so I feel like you somehow
Need to breathe your breathe and caress your dress
I'll be with you for quite some time

I'll take you where you wanna go
Tell me where
I wanna know
I will just go with the flow
As long as I'm there with you

Are the kids ok
Did they find the time to give the call today
But my hearts with yours
I am keeping score of the things that I have done wrong

Another funeral
All the people I know are beginning to fade away
And I have to say that at least today its beginning to get me down

To this day I'm lovin you
We know what we wanna do
I am your Troy Donnahue
And you are my Sandra Dee

Now I know you well
I still love you adore you I need you more than then
With your eyes still kind and your smile so bright

She was my heroin; she was my love and hate. 
She was perfection in a pill that takes me away.

This is love without a gun. 
This is my heart in ink as bold and black as the night we ended and as weak as your skin deep smiles. And this pen digs me into holes I can't write out of, I can't climb out of. 
These are the hands that will bury my face.

And the young people walking on Grafton street, and everyone looking so well,
I was singing a song I heard somewhere, called ""Rock 'n' roll never forgets"",
When my hummin' was smothered by a 46a and the scream of a low flying jet.
So I jumped on a bus to dun laoire, stoppin' off to pick up my guitar,
And a drunk on the bus told me how to get rich. 
I was glad we weren't goin' too far.

So I'm leavin' on Wednesday morning tryin' to find a place where I can hear
The tunes of the birds and the sea on the rocks, where open roads always are near,
And if sometimes I tire of the quiet, and I want to walk back up that hill,
I'll just get on the road and stick out my thumb.

Baha Men,"Ohhhh,
Where did I go wrong,
Ohhh,
Ohhhhh,
Girl when you went away,
You took a part of me and,
You told me not to wait,
You said you want to be free,
But I thought we'd be together,
Never thought that I'd be here alone,
I used to think you would never,
You'd never leave our happy home.

I thought that we were fine,
And everything was cool.
But maybe I was blind,
Maybe I was being the fool,
Cause I didn't see this comin',
Didn't know that you would walk away,
So I'm searching for the answers,
And maybe you can just tell me

Where did I go wrong?
And how can I make it right?
Tell me where did I go wrong?
You know I want to make it right,
And make you come back it me.

Although we're miles apart,
I'm still here missing you and,
You know you're in my heart,
You know I'm wanting you,
And I can still remember,
All the joy that you have brought to me
And I thought we'd stay together, 
Now I'm here just wondering,

Where did I go wrong?
And how can I make it right?
Tell me where did I go wrong?
You know I want to make it right,
And make you come back to me.

You know you'll always be there in my heart,
I still think about you everyday (Think about you everyday)
I never thought that we'd be apart,
Didn't realize I pushed you away.
Now I think I would do anything,
Just to have you again,
And I keep wondering , wondering..

Where did I go wrong?
And how can I make it right?
Tell me where did I go wrong?
You know I want to make it right,
And make you come back to me

And then, woah, there she was, I think she's looking right at me (no way),
Hey! I know what I see when I see it (right).
Watch me go down there and do my talk,
Hey girl, I just got something to say.

Tell me will it be okay if I say...
You got it! You all dat! You got it! Baby, don't turn me away.

I had to make a quick retreat, get ready for round two (bong).
Coz my love is like a bomb, about to explode,
And only she can light my fuse.
So I'm walking (woah), I'm talking (way),
Dang girl, I just got something to say.

Desperate men make desperate moves,
So I dropped to my knees and pray (yeah).
Please please, give me a night of romance just for two.
Until I opened my eyes and to my surprise,
My goddess of love was standing there, and she said.

Normal (If I do what you say am I)
Normal 

Well I'm just a normal guy in a normal world
I live a normal life. I got a normal girl
I drive to normal places in my normal car
I even wish upon the normal stars
But people say it isn't normal 
If I want to pierce my nose
Or if I let a blind man design my clothes
Or if I pick the petals leave the thorns upon my rose
Or if I just want to paint my toes 

People say it's not

Normal (is there more than one way to be)
Normal (I really think I'm okay and that´s)
Normal 

My momma say´s it isn't normal if I want to sleep all day
If I don´t get a normal job, I´ll throw my life away
She says I should go to school to get my B.A.
But me, I want to be a DJ
My friends say it isn't normal if I don´t want to touch that stuff
But I don´t need to follow no one, I´m already cool enough
You say I gotta be name brand, but I´m gonna call your bluff
And if you don´t like it that´s tough.

Once upon a time there was a man who had a wife
A couple kids, a cat, a dog. He thought he had a perfect life
That's not for me 
Because I want to be
I want to be a painter
And I want to be an actor and a sculptor
Or a clown
Maybe I want to drive a tractor
Why can't you see, that's normal to me
To me, that's normal 

So what-if I don't like the food you eat
So what if you don't like to dance to my beat
So what if you're expensive and you think I´m cheap
So what does that make me incomplete?
So what if I don't want to come my hair
So what. Judging me, that's really unfair
So what, I only listen to the man up there
And I bet you he thinks I'm normal 

I am my own man, so I do what I will
Every individual has their own skill
We all set goals that we want to fulfill
Whether a butcher, a baker, a computer maker
It's your life so do what you want to do
You got one life to live, you don´t have two
To yourself to yourself, you gotta be true
And that's gonna make you normal

Financially I´m a pauper
I´m not the man for you if it´s money you´re after [Repeat: x 2] 

This is not a bank
This is not a brinks
The best that I can buy for you is something cool to drink
You say you want gold chains and Gucci links
Expensive fur coats, Versace and minks
This is not Chase Manhattan or HSBC
Citibank or CIBC
You say what can I do for you but what can you do for me
You want me pay for your things but you want mine free

Don´t want an empty pocket man
He´s got to have money
No pauper, no beggar can get none of my honey
If you´re bank book´s low

Well I like to shop, will you build a mall for me
I like to fly will you buy a jet for me
If you do all of that
Then you´re my kind of man

Well I´m not saying I wouldn´t give it if I had it 
But right now it´s pure echo in your pockets

You see I´m out of your league so just drop it. 
I know my loving can´t bring you riches on the stock market 
You´re loving can´t even fill up my grocery basket

Me and dad had so much fun
Climbing trees and skipping stones
I had a couple of lizards
And a snake of my own!

But the biggest kick I've ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were playing on the dock
We were jumping in the river savin' big ol' crocs
When

Hold your rocking, something sunk
And how your feet just can't keep still
I'm always catching them every time
And I guess I always will

Up the river to be safe and sound
Cause I know a few places

When we move around a big ol' croc
Wrap the head and watch the tail!
That's the way my dad taught me

 lookin sweet enough to chew wit them saint eyes like tha brew,

ya live like channel sparkin' like mad-izm,

my woman's intuition tells me cupid's arrow's hittin,
you're the prince with the glass slipper that my foot could fit in,
this feelin that I have is never endin, I'm sendin, my love like Zhane' up

please accept these feelings I possess i'm like a damsel in distress in
pursuit of happiness, I confess

tryin to hold back these feelings for so long
and if you feel, like I feel baby
come on, ohhh, come on

Verse Two:

Many men wit mass appeal expand across the globe by the mills,
but still I picked you like a daffodil
cause you thrill me like magnetic fields that give my body chills,
perserve my chocolate ties and it's a thrill; I'm sayin
that when you swing my way I, get a sudden rush,
that entices me not to keep it on the hush-hush,
boy times girl times lust equals us,
and you can count on that like you would an abacus so
bust the equation, baby cause I'm facin the fact that I only think of you
on two occasions, but I'ma max once I get this off my chest, and just let
nature do the rest..

Verse Three:

I want to be down like brandy with you handy for tha duration,
engage in electric relaxation,
build a conversation, probe ya intellect,
put ya manhood to the test, but not just ya physical, ya individual is what
I'm after,
ya heart I want to capture, I'm open like a space that NASA explores,
truly do adore, every little move you make and more, my word is born
but I could go on and on throwin hints,
that I'm tha chick, you should be celebratin life wit,
so instead I felt it best if I just,
stood and represented in the flesh,
that I confess...

Before we parted
I would wonder what would make her stay

As if my drinking was the only thing that drove her away
Was it ambition? or war of attrition?
Honey, you could always take it out?

Got me thinking, what it might be like to be alone for a while,
Or alone for just one night

I share my feelings
You'd hit the ceiling
I couldn't shake it if I tried
You were my lover
Only to discover, something inside of me had died
Was it ambition? or war of attrition?

Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity

Bailey,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble

Como lágrimas partidas, como lágrimas perdidas

And yet disturbingly, another voice, a wholly darker and more malevolent
presence, can be perceived lurking within the ancient body of the inscriptions,
an ominous tone which prophesizes doom and ruination for the Atlantean realm,
speaking of a disastrous cataclysm foretold in the stars when the sun would
burn black and the agents of some unfathomable evil would besiege Atlantis,
ultimately compelling the seas to rise and devour the continent, leaving no
trace of the glory which once was. These passages seem to have been
deliberately obscured, and this fact combined with the passage of countless
aeons and the embrace of the eternally shifting sands lamentably prevents me
from translating the inscriptions on the fragment any further.",Atlantis Ascendant

They came in the night, and butchered five of my party, the terrified survivors
fleeing with the first wan light of dawn. The fiends seemed inexplicably to
be an extension of the night, as if their misshapen bodies were actually
somehow composed of the darkness itself. Even as I gazed directly at them,
I found I could not truly focus on their stygian forms... their bodies
appearing to shimmer and shift like the ripples of a heat-haze upon an arid
plain. My ammunition, discharged in vain, is all but spent... and now, as night
unfurls its malign wings once more to enshroud this desolate and forsaken
place, I wait alone for the sunrise I fear I shall never see. At dusk I
discovered a hidden alcove in the time-raught surface of the great monolith
which stands as a mute sentinel before the entrance to the colossal temple;
a moss encrusted crevice concealed from the eyes of man for I know not how
long. As the darkness massed about me, a strange miasma seemed to grip my mind
in tenebrous tendrils, and I beheld that horrifying and immemorial edifice
which I now feel certain once cast its diabolical shadow upon the Gate of the
Sun. It is all true, everything I feared, everything which I dared imagine
only in the blackest embrace of the most narcotic malignity. There are Six
Keys To The Onyx Pyramid, which conceal a terrifying truth never intended to
be grasped by the woefully fragile mind of Man. I now pray that no unfortunate
soul ever again stumbles as close as I to those cryptic axioms which lie ever
in wait between the incorporeal veils of light and shadow. I would offer up a
prayer to the divinity which once I worshipped, but I know it would echo
emptily through the abyssal reaches of the unheeding cosmos. As I scrawl this
final entry in my journal, the sun sinks with a chilling finality below this
now alien horizon. I know the shadowy figures shall soon return to claim me.

It was a time of change. The descendants of the Atlantean mages had fallen
before the New Praesidium, and the wolves were baying at the Empire's door.
An oppressive new faith was encroaching from the east, and the sylvan liege
had locked tight the gates of his arboreal realm. And so it was that towards
the end of the Age of Mystery, the last of Albion's great Dragon Lords did
gather for what would be their final battle...

[12 October: 1893]
I must commit this to the pages of my journal, while it is still vivid in my
recollection... not that such a macabre vision could possibly soon be
blissfully forgotten. Just before dawn, I awoke from a fantastic and somewhat
horrifying dream in which I traversed a great black cyclopean cityscape,
its towering stygian walls inscribed with some form of outlandish glyphs which
seemed to writhe squamously and alter their shape even as I gazed at them.
A sibilant whispering which seemed at once familiar and yet intrusively alien
compelled me to walk to the edge of a particularly sinister looking edifice
and peer out over its precipitous perimeter. When I did so, I beheld this
world of ours, recognizing vaguely the apparent shapes of the five continents,
yet the entire vista seemed so distant that the whole appeared in its entirety
no larger than a sphere which I could fit snugly into the palm of my hand.
When I turned again to behold the looming obelisks, I found I could then
easily read the previously untranslatable ciphers in the black stone. They
were the words of a great thaumaturgist who had seemingly discovered a
repository of aeons-old lore detailing the sidereal web of the cosmos, with
arcane diagrams pinpointing certain astral portals and places of empyreal
potency, a sort of pangalactic ley-line chart, if you will. Indeed, these
Star-Maps Of The Ancient Cosmographers seemed to take a not insignificant toll
on the author's sanity, as evidenced by the tone of his inscriptions, which
seem to suggest that in discovering this Pandora's Box of dark elucidation,
his fate was to be inexorably dogged by some nameless and implacable gloom;",Draconis Albionensis

Upon extensive examination of the nefarious arcane codex known as The Epsilon
Exordium, I believe my search may at last be drawing to a close. 
Indeed, I feel that perhaps the great discovery which has eluded me for so long may
Finally be within my grasp. 
And yet I must be cautious, for twice more have I seen the figures in the night, watching me in silence from the confines of the darkness. 
I cannot discern their features, only that they are vaguely human in shape, save for their arms which seem abnormally long and oddly jointed. 
My native guides are becoming increasingly agitated and skittish, babbling incoherently about the guardians of the tombs... citing legends from their ancestral past which speak of mysterious travelers who reputedly came down from the stars in great silvern chariots drawn by steeds of flame.
At any rate, I have my trusted Martini-Henry .45 calibre breech-loader should these silent stalkers prove malign and ever deign to lay hold of me in the night. 
I have at last translated the carvings on the stone fragment I unearthed amidst the ruins of Angkor Wat. To my astonishment, I found that it predated the construction of the temple itself by countless thousands of years, and that it spoke of the same subject as did the hieroglyphs I beheld on the
Wall of the concealed chamber which I and Lord Blakiston discovered within the Great Pyramid in Egypt. 
Successive examinations of the edifices at Giza and Karnak revealed further parallels too precise to be mere coincidence. 
The pieces of this great cosmic puzzle are finally beginning to fall into place...

(2 October, 1893)
Yes, it is as I suspected. I have long felt that the Sumerians of Mesapotamia were among the first peoples to attain elucidation concerning the dread matter I pursue.
My excavations at Lagash, Eridu, and most notably the ziggurats at you're, have revealed truths which subsequent finds at Angkor, Egypt and Sacsahuaman only serve to consolidate. 
I now know that the Olmechs, the Aztecs and the Mayans were also undeniably key tendrils of this grand global web, and the unnerving truth I hitherto felt compelled to deny now seems inexorably
To point to some grand and terrifying universal axiom.
It seems however, that the closer I come to enlightenment, the greater the danger becomes. 
Last night, one of our expedition's chief guides disappeared without trace. 
His native compatriots could find no tracks, nor offer any evidence of his departure to suggest that his superstitions had finally compelled him to abandon the party... the man seems simply to have vanished inexplicably into the oppressive, sweltering dark. 
In light of the disappearance, I opted not to inform the group that during the darkling hours
Before sunrise last night I had peered from my tent to behold what I perceived to be three of the shadowy figures I have previously described moving furtively in the gloom, keeping ever just out of the illuminatory radias of our campfire.
By the time I had brought my rifle to bear, they had melted away into the fathomless shadows of the benighted jungle...

The inscriptions on the tablet I discovered seem to be a fragmentary piece of some mysterious, perhaps apocryphal, larger work; evidently a lexicon of some description, undoubtedly of antediluvian origin. 
The first section, as far as I can discern, tells of an era thousands of years past when countless great and advanced civilisations, apparently with the legendary Atlantis foremost amongst them, spanned the circumference of the globe.

Tribal creation myth and folklore from the Northern Hemisphere, dating from 650 B.T.C. (Before the Third Cataclysm), Antediluvian Calendar:

Hearken, children of the Ersatz gods, sons and daughters of the New Earth, for here is truth. Long ago, before the third of Earth's moons fell firey from the star-seared sky, there were those whom we have come to call the First Ones. These men-who-were-not-men were the creations of the Mera, beings from the far reaches of the limitless cosmos, whose essence still flickers latently within the minds of all their disparate progeny. Praise the Mera, fathers of the First Ones, bondsmen to the Kl'aa, sworn foes of the Z'xulth! 
Sired in the great spawning vats beyond the fathomless deeps of the Pre-Cambrian sea, the First Ones throve. Those who were engineered to live on land duly constructed the grand Antarctic Megalopolis, ultimately becoming entangled in bitter conflicts with the hoary Serpent Kings before retreating into the subterrene depths of the vast inner world, whereas those First Ones that had chosen the embrace of the abyssal seas were the architects of vast and glorious submarine cities whose splendid spires and minarets towered proudly beneath the unfathomed waves. Those grand bioluminescent cities are now long since fallen, razed and dispersed, given over to the cruel whims of the unforgiving oceans. 
From the lore of our ancestors, we know the true nature of the cosmos. We know of the hidden and silent places, the places which reside in between the veils of reality, the places which mankind was never meant to see.
All this we know... we who survive, we who are descended from those First Ones, and who give thanks to the gods-who-are-not-gods, for our creation, our genesis, for the breath of life that was forced into our progenitors during the early epochs of this cratered globe.

Chapter 11: The Siege Begins 

And so the mighty and resplendent armies of the Imperium assembled before the towering cyclopean walls of ancient Gul-Kothoth. It was some time before the billowing dust cloud raised by the massed arrival of the vast imperial host settled, ultimately dissipating as the shadows of dusk descended. With nightfall, the imperial army's countless torches, braziers and cookfires illumined the dark plain before the fortress like a coruscating sea, painting the stygian heavens the colour of flame. And the high summer's night passed swiftly. At length, the dawn approached tentatively, and with the first signs of the newborn sun etching its promise upon the skies, the martial preparations commenced in earnest. A brief and perfunctory exchange between the Imperial Herald and the fortification's Watch Commander held no surprises, and the Emperor's banner was duly driven into the seared earth before Gul-Kothoth with a chilling finality. Vast siege engines and powerful ballistae were hauled inexorably into position, alongside a battery of katapelte and petrobolos. The one hundred thousand strong Imperial Frontier Army, having planted their regimental blazons into the arid soil, waited with a disciplined patience born of never having met defeat in pitched battle or siege, the dreaded Imperial War-Leopards straining noisily against their iron-link leashes to the rear of the cohorts of conscripts and auxillieries. The pitiless Iron Phalanx and their Lord Militant Commander had assumed position at the head of the army's Alpha Wing, polished swords, spears and poll-axes reflecting the glow from the myriad torches and braziers which still burned about the Imperial Host. And behind them were drawn up the legendary Legion of the Ebon Tiger, Pride of the Emperor, the infantry and cavalry famed throughout the Great Northern Continent, personal regiment of the feared general Baalthus Vane. True to their martial reputation, the six thousand strong Legion were inscrutible in their jet black armour, their sable banner billowing in the chill breeze which skittered over the plain. And finally, astride his azure-shaffroned warhorse and surrounded by his elite guard, the silvern-armoured Emperor Koord himself studied the precipitious gates with a disdainful scrutiny. At the Emperor's right hand was the renowned Swordmaster of Kyrman'ku, an eastern bladesman of preternatural skill and the most revered and expensive mercenary in the Imperium. At his left, the infamous Ogre-Mage of the Black Lake brooded silently, swathed in a stygian cloak and fuliginous cowl and exuding an aura of implacable malevolence which unerved even the bravest of the Imperial troops. The Emperor had deemed the services of these two nefarious renegades pivotal to the execution of the Final Campaign, for they alone had knowledge of the mysterious arcane rite known as The Words Which Unfetter. 
And, behind their titanic time-worn palisades, the defenders of Gul-Kothoth beheld this awesome force ranged against them and shuddered, not with fear, but with an awful and night-cold anticipation.

THE EMPEROR KOORD: General Vane, we begin the final stage of this campaign with the rising of the sun. This war which has raged for decades shall finally be decided here, before the hoary walls of ageless Gul-Kothoth. The Imperium's last and most glorious victory is at hand. The procrastinating sybarites of the bureaucracy have been threatened and bribed into compliance over this venture. This more than anything else is why I have deigned to grace this final battle with my Imperial presence, even against the advice of the Grand Vizier and the sage counsel of the Seers.
BAALTHUS VANE: You shall enjoy watching the Ebon Tiger bloody its claws, sire. Our victory here is assured.
THE EMPEROR KOORD: You should not call in your falcons before the hunt is done, my loyal servitor. Overconfidence is but one of the many foes a general must face upon the field of war. Today, the precepts and maxims of the Imperium shall be tested, and we shall see whether the velvet glove of diplomacy or the iron gauntlet of conquest has proved the more effective tool.  
BAALTHUS VANE: The days of the feudal suzerainties are long gone, my liege. The Imperial Military Council is the only entity fit to govern the dominions. The fall of Vyrgothia shall today render the truth of the Imperial Mandate self evident.      
THE EMPEROR KOORD: And yet I am vexed, for as you well know, the sorcerous emmisary I despatched to the Court of the Over-King has warned that the Vyrgothians may have recovered one of the artefacts comprising the fabled Trinity of Might; the legendary Obsidian Crown itself! In the hands of a skilled thaumaturgist, it is said that the Crown may be used as a weapon of unparalleled destructive potency.
BAALTHUS VANE: The Shadow-Sword! The Obsidian Crown! The Ebon Sceptre! Feh! The power of the Trinity is but a myth! No antiquated trinket weilded by a religious fanatic will prevail against the Legion, sire. Our steel is proof against such diabolism! Behold! Gul-Tryarch has fallen, Gul-Azlaan has been given to the earth, Gul-Nomedes is naught but smouldering rubble, and soon we shall surge over the shattered remnants of Gul-Kothoth's renowned walls! The Vyrgothian Alliance shall crumble when these gates are breached, and the Over-King himself shall stand before thee in shackles! 
THE EMPEROR KOORD: Indeed. At any rate, I have been blessed with foresight enough to prepare a contingency should the foe fulfil that fearful potential which has been weighing heavy on my mind. But now, the sun rises! Let it begin! Let the final chapter of our legend be written! Give the word! Raze Gul-Kothoth to the ground!

The Imperial War-Skalds:
An age of fire, sword and shield,
The thunder of the battlefield,
The clarions call, bring down the wall!
May the Empire's glory never fade,
Righteous fury guide our blades,
We march to war!

The Wizards of Vyrgothia: 
Darkly bejewelled circlet of night, Crown of the Elder King,
Unfettered at last the Trinity of Might, the Sceptre, the Sword and the Ring!

 

Chapter 12: The Fall of Gul-Kothoth

And so it was that a terrible and inestimable carnage was unleashed upon the field of battle. Colossal stones, firebrands and howling iron-tipped missiles rained pitilessly down upon the hero-hewn walls of Gul-Kothoth. Vast and serpentine cracks appeared in the ancient cyclopean edifice, and hundreds of warriors, both attackers and defenders, perished in the fray, either crushed beneath the ceaselessly assailed testudo, hammered to crimson pulp by the merciless storm of unforgiving stone, or burned to blackened husks by the nightmare onslaught of flaming quicklime and saltpetre. Scaling ladders raised and repulsed in turn, storms of razor tipped shafts exchanged by the combatants, isolated skirmishes raging upon the ramparts, men blade to blade and clarions bellowing embattled defiance. For seemingly inumerable hours the sanguineous battle raged, with no quarter asked nor given between the bitter ancestral foes. And the gates held firm.
At length, the mightiest of the Empire's iron-hooded battering rams, dubbed The Bringer of Woe, was brought to bear upon the besieged fortress, and, with the shadows of dusk lengthening upon the field of war, the centuries old Primary Gate of Gul-Kothoth was finally sundered amidst an earsplitting cacophony of shattering oak and iron louder than any storm-born thunderclap. With the rending of the mighty gate, and vast fragments of the ancient walls yielding, buckling and crashing to the blood-sodden earth, the Imperium's forces breached the defenses of Gul-Kothoth and surged into the Vyrgothian Alliance's last and most renowned stronghold.
And it was at that fate-steeped instant that an army of five score and ten, bearing the Obsidian Crown, arrived upon the field of battle.

Chapter 13: The Wizards Do Battle

THE SORCERER:  By Klatrymadon and Zuranthus! They come! They come, weilding the Circlet of Night! The dire warning issued to me as I stood before Vyrgothia's Master Wizard has been proved no idle boast! The citadel's spells of containment breached... the Black Crown is upon us!  
THE EMPEROR KOORD:  It is as I have forseen! Be spry, my sorcerous lackey... join the Iron Phalanx in entertaining these latecomers while I prepare a reception worthy of their audacity!
THE SORCERER: By your command, o' luminous Imperial majesty!

At once, the far-feared and martially renowned Iron Phalanx wheeled to face the newcomers, and at the command of a decurion, a volley of armour-piercing shafts screamed skywards to rain down mercilessly upon the foe. And even as this transpired, the Emperor's Prime Sorcerer, emissary of the Imperial Court and master of those arts which speak to man in narcotic dreams from the darkest and most silent places, summoned forth that black potency which lay entwined in stygian tendrils within his mind...  an ireful power born of they who writhed upon the shores of Pangaea before man's progenitors ever erected their lofty spires to the restless skies. And yet Vyrgothia's Master Wizard, unrivalled Arch-Mage and adept of that lost Eastern order who journey beyond the boundaries of time and space upon those nebulous wings born of the sacred Azure Lotus, rose to meet this power which lapped at the periphery of his mind like a midnight tide, and stood firm against its insistent siren call.
And upon that arid field of war, the sentinels of light and shadow spoke to eachother in tongues dormant since the Third Moon fell burning from the heavens, and not sweet were the words they uttered. 
Until at last, with the armies poised to clash, and with dusk painting the sky a deep crimson exceeded in its vibrancy only by that bloody rubicund hue which stained the battlefield below it, the Emperor's mage fell, and the aeons-old might of the Obsidian Crown was finally brought to bear against they who had breached the walls of ancient Gul-Kothoth.

The Imperial War-Skalds:
Sundered, the gate of the ancient fortress,
Besieged! Now breached stand the walls.
And lo, there and army of five score and ten,
Behold! The Obsidian Crown.
Embattled, the wizards, their weapons arcane,
Untramelled, the circlet, the Prime-Sorcerer slain,
The Crown's peerless power, the Emperor's bane,
Dark magicks and havoc, now red carnage reigns!

Like the prow of a blood-hungry vessel of war rending the waves of a midnight sea, a luminescent blade of shrieking cerulean light lanced from the legendary black circlet locked tight within the gnarled hand of the Master Wizard, and clove mercilessly into the glorious ranks of the Imperium. And all who were touched by this ruinous arc of coruscating radiance knew no more... Men and beasts reduced to blackened husks, charred shells of smouldering ash, lifeless effigies which toppled to the seared earth to be dissipated by the whispering breath of the wind. Again and again the ravaging radiance smote the ranks of the Empire, leaving a noisome charnel-pit of nightmare in its crackling wake. The forces of the Imperium were plunged into a howling vortex of disarray, and, faced with the unthinkable prospect of defeat, the unprecedented first routing of the Emperor's glorious army began to become a grim reality. Yet for all the unparalleled carnage which had erupted about them, there was one regiment of Imperial troops for whom the taste of fear was bland compared to the sharp tang of rage which sat bitter upon their noble tongues...   

BAALTHUS VANE:  By all the gods of war! Stand fast, hounds of the Imperium! 'Tis true... steel is no use against this ignoble magical trickery! But if our souls are bound for the Pit this day, we'll damn well take a few of these bastards with us! Onward, my Legion! Alpha formation, banners high! Glory to the Emperor! Into the foe! Show them the Tiger's claws!
THE LEGION: Never quarter, never mercy, never retreat! Praise the Emperor!  
THE EMPEROR KOORD:  My sorcerous thrall has fallen, but he has bought us time enough to riposte! And General Vane's mettle may yet turn the tide of war back in our favour. Now, let the final act be played out! I call thee forth, Ogre-Mage of the Black Lake! I call thee forth, Swordmaster of Kyrman'ku! It is time! Now, I charge thee, for the glory of the Imperium... Speak the Words Which Unfetter!  

And so, it began... the two pivotal players in the Emperor's plan, the two key figures in the Imperium's contingency, stepped forth to fill their most vital of roles in that grand theatre of carnage which now ran unchecked on the field of battle.
The Ogre-Mage and the Swordmaster began to utter fearsome words in a tongue which was ancient ere the gleaming stars shifted upon the fathomless countenance of the distant heavens, words which in truth were not words, but rather a resonant key which would aspire to unlock a dire power which had reposed shackled since the fall of the legendary Shadow King himself, whose ebon circlet's power they even now sought to thwart. The incantation they gave voice to in the midst of that sanguineous turmoil which engulfed them was not so much heard by those within earshot as perceived, sensed as a vague disturbance in the fabric of reality, as fuliginous ripples on the surface of a hitherto still and placid pool, growing ever larger and more far reaching; an unnerving and unnamable sense of change which insinuated itself into the mind of the listener and suggested with a cold and disturbing quasi-certainty that something of preternaturally ineffable magnitude was transpiring, as surely as a festering and gangrenous corpse would split to spill its noisome gore. And as that maddeningly implacable incantation reached its resounding climax, a momentary silence enshrouded the battlefield, swathing the vista of chaos in an aura of noiselessness more pure and untainted than the tranquility of the boundless and stygian void. It was as if time itself had halted for one immemorial moment.
And it was in that oddly immeasurable instant that the dark and peerless power unfettered by those grim pseudo-words finally, ultimately, made itself known before the sundered gates of ancient Gul-Kothoth...

Some would call it an epiphany, others would deem it the final descent into madness... whatever the 
case, the last vestiges of those tenuous palisades which had previously, and blessedly, safeguarded
my reason and prevented my mind from accepting the full and staggering magnitude of the naked truth then crumbled, fading into nothingness like the dissolution of a night-mist. At length, one oppressively miasmic night, with such malefically portentous lore preying pitilessly upon my sanity, I began to descend through a myriad veils of sombre and swirling shades, finally surrendering my grip on wakefulness. And on that fitful, fateful eve, the last of the dreams came... 
A waking dream? I dare not speculate. The vision was mine, the soul too... but the time, the place, the very flesh, all this and more was unknown to me. I stood upon a nighted vista... unfeasibly alien, and yet at once wholly, unnervingly familiar. In my hand I grasped a glimmering crystal which although beautiful in its shimmering radiance, was as black as the impenetrable depths of the most stygian midnight sea. As I gazed into the obsidian heart of the gem, a needle of black light lanced forth from its multi-faceted surface and filled my eyes with a panoply of fantastic hues, revealing to me in between its pulses of massing darkness certain fleeting glimpses of places and things so fantastically terrifying that I could not faithfully begin to recount their hideous and yet grimly compelling nature. A terrible sound filled my ears... an insidious resonance which sent waves of excruciating pain coursing through my mind... a sound which inexorably coalesced into a recognizable but entirely inhuman voice, a voice which slowly, inevitably, formed approximations of words which I could discern...

Fragmentary entry I:
I have come into possession of a certain ancient book, a collection of arcane scrawlings reputed to have been derived from an even earlier transcription, allegedly lost during the great fire of 1666. The Chthonic Chronicles! I cannot disclose here the precise and rather unsavoury means by which I acquired this weather-worn tome, but I immediately recognized the veracity of the fevered inscriptions contained within. Apparently derived from an incomplete Latin translation of the original source material, the text sporadically lapses into an indecipherable tongue which the transcription cryptically notes as being Old High Atlantean. Glyphs, sigils, occult pictograms, six score and ten oblations to some malign entity of colossal evil...some diabolical avatar of the Z'xulth. Khthon! I must delve further into the foreboding depths of this great black book...

Fragmentary entry II:
Caught in the maleficent whorls and verticils of this dark tome... but what lies at the heart of it? A vespertine viper's nest of sublime wickedness! What I discovered within this shadow-haunted volume was a terrifying axiom so inestimably terrible in its magnitude that it would shatter all man's carefully orchestrated views of the cosmos and render utterly redundant previous theories on the origin of humankind. Lore dating from time immemorial; lore surviving in the records of long extinct civilizations, be it inscribed upon parchment now crumbled to dust, etched into the sand-whipped, glyph-scored stone of hoary temples, or committed to verbal traditions long since ingrained into some collective tribal memory. This is no globally common myth cycle, no collection of universally allegorical folk tales; it is all cold, pitiless truth!
And yet, such enlightenment has not been a prize easily won...I have communed with native shamans, consulted with misanthropic diabloists, I have confronted the martial agents, acolytes and cultists of clandestine sects who would see their knowledge safeguarded at all costs. Hildebrandt and the Quorum have treacherously attempted to have me commited to the baleful confines of Grimm's Hold Sanitarium, yet I have circumvented their insidious plot to put an end to my vaunted research. Damn their traitorous eyes! I must confer with Blackthorne upon his return from the Peruvian expedition... or mayhap Stone if ever the poor wretch regains his sanity...

Fragmentary entry III:
What titanic demi-gods once strode the boiling surface of the young earth, treading the shattered surface of mighty Pangaea beneath their ersatz feet? What fearsome entities were already inestimably ancient when mankind himself was naught but a collection of mindless random atoms, a viscous puddle of gelid protoplasm teeming with the raw materials of life, transient cells of primordial slime, all naught but malleable and tractable clay to be worked at by unimaginable sculptors, immortal star-spanning fiends! What inhuman eyes even now watch the inconsequential toilings of man from afar? The answers to these questions of denied primacy and direful cosmogony were too repulsively horrific to contemplate, and yet...  I knew the truth! 
And more terrifying still... The Z'xulth and their villainous agents of depravity even now walk among us!  
But what price these revelations? What dire agents of malignity safeguard such cryptic axioms against the prying intellect of man? I must confesss, oftimes in the brooding darkness of the night, I have sensed their malefic gaze upon me, lurking, inexorably dogging my every step, their existence perceived only as some unnamable sense of fearful unease, and the occaisional glimpse of black shimmering against black in the depths of the teeming shadows... I hear them whispering when the mantle of darkness silences the world, and the sibilant words they utter are not for the minds of men to know. O' how I wish I had left those vile and fathomless depths of cryptical lore wholly and mercifully unplumbed! O', how I long for the assuaging balm of ignorance to once again soothe my ravaged mind! But such pleadings are, of course, ultimately in vain. I must keep my wits about me. Even now the stars align, the celestial spheres moving into the prophesied positions of the great astral conjunction. Am I to be ground to dust between the grand gears of this pitiless cosmic engine of destruction? The die is cast, the endgame nears.

At large throughout the cosmos
It is a ravenous and pitiless storm which rages across the universe
Permeating the very fabric of creation, existing simultaneously
In all dimensions, wholly unconstrained by linear time

This force is the black, quasi-sentient mana which sustains
Such ageless revenants of the Z'xulth as the dread Dwellers
In Eternal Shadow and the unspeakable

When beings whose essences are intrinsically malefic
Choose to embrace this dark some energy source
The resultant sinister symbiosis can be sublimely diabolical
As evidenced by the black blight that was the infamous
Pseudo-human sorcerer Lord Angsaar

And of course, the malign Zurra, that abominable
Result of an experiment by the Ersatz Ones gone disastrously wrong
An ill advised attempt to clone the K'laa genetic template
Of mighty Zuranthus in the Mera spawning vats

Beneath the Pre-Cambrian sea, only for the matrix
To become contaminated by the errant cells of a captured
Fiend of Z'xulth, the result was a prime fiend whose capacity for evil
And wanton annihilation was exceeded only by a penchant
For self-aggrandizement and his rampant psychological instability

In many cases, the potential for ruination and domination that
Such entities may aspire to is constrained only
By their own physical and psychological limitations
As the toll which the dark mana takes upon the host's mind
And flesh is not insignificant

CENTURION DECIANUS VARUS: Alea iacta est! Emperor Publius Helvius Pertinax has fallen victim to the assassin's blade. As I stand gazing out across the massed ranks of our Pannonian legions, Septimus Severus duly strives to consolidate his newly acquired control of the Empire. Pescennius Niger is slain, his forces expelled from Cyzicus, Nicaea and Issus, and yet Clodius Albinus has sailed from Britannia and is raising an army in Gaul in his own bid to seize the throne. Severus intends to engage that northern host at Lugdunum once his campaigns here in the east are concluded. Behold Byzantium! We now prepare to lay siege to this ancient and splendoured city. Strangely, the order has been given that the Byzantine library is to be searched thoroughly following our victory. Rumour has it that Severus's aged soothsayer Angsaar is searching for a collection of arcane scrolls said to be of the utmost importance, scrolls which are reputed to be hidden somewhere here in Byzantium. Something about that wizened old shaman unnerves me... there is something strangely unnatural about him, something... sinister. Feh! What are those scrolls supposed to be called again? Ah yes, The Chthonic Chronicles...",To Storm the Cyclopean Gates of Byzantium

Fragmentary delusional recollections from within the confines of Grimm's Hold Sanitarium: 
When Blackthorne returns from his expedition to Tiahuanaco and the Peruvian jungle I shall duly tell him of the catalyst which compelled me to those cursed black vaults in ancient Ur, should Hildebrandt allow me another visit. Yes... Giza, Karnak, Thebes... I see them now once more! In the grip of a waking dream, I walk those restless sands again. Egypt... here my journey began, and here I took the first steps towards destiny... and damnation.
(The events recounted here take place before ""The Dreamer In The Catacombs Of Ur"")

From the expeditionary journal of Doctor Ignatius X. Stone: 

Giza, Egypt (March 17, 1890)
The heat here is damnably oppressive, and all day the omnipresent sand has been whipped up by an impudent wind, making progress all the more difficult. At dawn, I pinpointed the location of the Great Pyramid's secret chamber which my old friend Professor Caleb Blackthorne and his benefactor Lord Blakiston had discovered several months previously, but ingress to its concealed depths was denied me by a partial collapse of the age old edifice's stone ceiling. Excavation is evidently impossible, lest more of the mighty tomb come crashing down about us. At any rate, Blackthorne has studied the incredible inscriptions within that hidden alcove exhaustively, and in truth my own interests lie elsewhere in this desolate sand-flayed landscape. The traditionalists believe that, in keeping with Egyptian tenets, only mundane things such as new air shafts and ever more ornate sarcophagi are yet to be discovered deep within the tunnel networks of these cyclopean monuments. Feh! If only they knew the true extent of this great cosmic puzzle! They are as fools who view a tapestry in a darkened room by the light of only one candle, seeing only small sections illuminated one by one, and refusing to recognize or connect the darkened and unseen areas to the entirety.
Working from the geometric calculations which I prepared before our arrival here, I have studied the alignment of Cheops, Chefren and Mykerinos. It is as I suspected. Tomorrow, I leave the the imperious and hoary mausoleum of Khufu and seek answers within the Great Temple of Karnak...

Karnak, Egypt (March 18, 1890) 
What oblations to the grim chthonic deities of the ancient world were once offered solemnly beneath the stygian skies of this sweltering place, I wonder? What sublime power awaits the aspirant, the querent who dares seek answers in those shadowed places where men of lesser fortitude fear to gaze? Blackthorne often berates me for what he calls my preoccupation with the arcane, the occult, the sinistrous lore of the chthonic... he insists no good will come of such delving into nighted realms. Ha! The path to elucidation is seldom devoid of thorns, the road to knowledge rarely free of perils! I seek enlightenment, and by the erudite tongue of Herodotus, I may have found it! Ancient tradition of this land has long spoken of strange flashes of light emanating from the depths of pyramid passages and temple catacombs. Over a thousand years ago the Arabs wrote of the transient walls and hidden chambers of these monuments; of secret doors moved by an unseen force and of implacable sentries who guarded the secrets of the temples with dour tenacity. What I found this evening gives credence to all that and more. Is the lore which I discovered carved into the ancient stone of Karnak's temple the next fragment of the cryptic conundrum which I have dedicated my life to solving? The Coptic papyrus states that, upon the walls of the pyramids and the temples were inscribed the mysteries of science, astronomy, geometry and physics; inscriptions of unknown peoples and lost civilizations whose lore was carved into the stone to preserve it from the ravages of the great deluge. The surviving knowledge of long forgotten antediluvian races! 
Aye, prudent Surid, heeding the warnings of his priests, erected certain repositories of long forgotten knowledge to withstand first a great flood, and then an all-consuming fire which was prophesied would come from the sky. Masoudi, in the tenth century, described automata; titanic guardians of stone and metal which were placed to guard the treasures and the entombed lore, and which were tasked to destroy all those deemed unworthy, all those who dared enter the chambers unbidden. I see them! The hoary sentinels of Karnak unfettered! Rising from their sandy tombs to smite the intruder, the raider and the interloper with righteous fury! And what is this... was there once a glimmer of life within the sightless stone eyes of the Theban guardian? Does the silent watcher at Giza even now descend from its granite dias to once more stalk the shifting sands on carven claws? Hu! Horem-akhet! 

 

The alignment of Cheops, Chefren and Mykerinos revealed,
Chthonic lore concealed in Khufu's imperious mausoleum,
By the erudite tongue of Herodotus, I have found the answers,
Arcane secrets inscribed in the ancient Coptic papyrus,
The Pyramid's legacy compells me to these dark discoveries,
The Theban guardian rises from its sandy tomb to meet us,
The Silent Watcher stalks, behold the Sentinels of Karnak!

Thebes, Egypt (March 19, 1890)
Niut-Ammon! Lucidity has reasserted its blessed hold upon me. I understand now the true nature of that knowledge which was revealed to me deep within the shadowed confines of Karnak's timeless temple. Telluric energy, harnessed by the ancients... triggered by lunar rays and solar radiation, channeled to impart static charges to rock strata and lines of natural power running through the earth. Neuro-electric energy generated, developed, creating light, separating inertia from gravity! And what more? The fourth state of matter, forged countless millennia ago in the hearts of burning stars... fettered, channeled, for creation and destruction! The secret of the great monuments of the ancients! Yes, secrets... answers. A rogue celestial body passes inside the orbit of the moon, becoming a captive of the earth's gravitational field. The world tilts upon its axis, its revolution slows, the planet shifts farther from its parent star... one of many such cataclysms. Asteroid strikes, floods, firestorms, the sky swathed in a veil of darkness through which the sun's light cannot pass, great ice-ages enshrouding the globe. And what is this? The forces of evil, of chaos... servitors of the sinister gods of the universe... manifesting upon the tellurian sphere? What dire agents of malignity were unleashed upon mankind? Bringers of carnage and destruction, pestilence and decay! The Z'xulth! 
Secrets once known by the forgotten peoples... ancient Atlantis... time-lost Lemuria... Hyperborea, Ultima Thule, utopian Atland and its enduring legacy. Fragments, memories... descendants... the Incas, the Aztecs, the Maya, the Egyptians, the Greeks, the Britons, the Frisians, the ancient Sumerians. Yes, it is clear to me, like a diamond worked to perfection in the skilled hands of a master craftsman. The sigils and glyphs I beheld carved into the ancient stone of Karnak (which I somehow understood implicitly), the visions I experienced within the temple, it is all quite clearly compelling me to the next stage in my grand voyage of enlightenment. According to the inscriptions, the truth, the key, awaits me within the ziggurats of ancient Sumeria. I hear the call of the ancients, beckoning me to that aeon-veiled place across the unforgiving sands. We shall depart at once. I feel sure I shall find that which I seek between the two rivers, at the place of the seven cities. Yes, I shall surely meet my destiny within the mystery-haunted catacombs of ancient Ur...

(From the pyramids of Egypt, to the ziggurats of Sumeria, my grand journey of enlightenment must continue. Praise the Ancients!) 

The Keeper of the Ancient Lore of Ur:
Hearken to the warnings of the Ancients... tread softly those sacred and unforgiving sands. Do not break the seal of the seventh city!

The Chief Cultist of Ur:
The Gate must not be opened. You dare not awaken the Dreamer!

Cuneiform tablets bear a grim, darkly portentous warning,
Sumerian catacombs astir with vile Chthonic horrors,
The lore of Babylon inscribed in stone as old as Atlantis,
Glyphs and sigils now compell me to the ziggurats...

In a waking dream, I hear the call of the Ancients. I shall find that which I seek between the two rivers, at the place of the seven cities... in the Catacombs of Ur!

She can do what she wants with me,
I'm a wheeling casualty

Something going on,
Don't try to save me,

Every time you need me you're just messing with my head
Well if you love then you love me baby let me know
And if you don't why don't you leave me baby let me go
You then twist me inside out
Girl you know I feel like I've been waiting for a lifetime
Come around

Cause I'm going crazy
Let me know girl if you feel me breaking now
If you want me tonight
I'll be right by your side
And if you don't then I'll be leaving
Right now

How am I supposed to know to know what's going through your mind
Girl you know I wish that we could stop this and rewind
If you want me you'll be there every second and
And you thought that I would never ever be your man
Now the tables are turned upside down
But don't cha know I feel like I've been waiting for a lifetime
Until I come around

I was the one who tried to pick you up
But the other one was waiting
I could not afford to be stood up
Right as you call
Right as you call ""I have to get my stuff""
Don't defend the decision
Or pretend it didn't happen to us

Just before I could go
She would run run run run run run run
She was the one
She was the one who tried to break us
One who tried to take us apart
She was the one
Before the fun had even begun

And I hardly think about her
Hardly think about her
Hardly think about her
All the time time time
Hardly think about her
Hardly think about her
All the time time time time time time time

But forgiving is fun
Over the nights I knew that she was the one
I get my day book open just to angle for a coffee with someone
But she'll never fall (in love)
She'll never fall in love with one of us
She's the time to keep us thinking
All along that we've got things worked up

Just before all I saw
I could run run run run run run
She was the one
She was the one who tried to break us
One that tried to take us apart

And I hardly think about her
Hardly think about her
Hardly think about her
All the time time time
Hardly think about her
Hardly think about her
All the time time time time time time time

You and I both know that's real enough to let it go
But still
We've got things all thinking all the time
Enough to talk about
And you know why things go wrong

She was the one
She was the one who tried to break us
One who tried to take us apart
Yeah, she was the one

And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
I gotta shake it off
Just like the Calgon commercial
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake it off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give

Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means I gotta
Shake you off

It's gonna be too late
So don't bother paging me

See I grabbed all my diamonds and clothes
Just ask your momma she knows
You're gonna miss me baby
Hate to say ""I told you so""
Well at first I didn't know
But now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks
And lie compulsively
So I packed up my Louis Vuitton
Jumped in your ride and took off
You'll never ever find a girl
Who loves you more than me

I'ma hang up and call the machine right back
I gotta get this off of my mind

I'm never coming back home

Baloji,"Teach me how to fall in love
Want you to touch me baby

Ca y est ! Une interruption s'impose
Un coup de gaz dans ce rap à l'eau de rose
Mais pour lui un coup d'un soir, pour elle un coup du sort
Comment s'en sortir quand les liens se déteriorent ?
On s'est rapproché sur un collé-serré
Quart d'heure américain façon congolais
Tu joues avec le feu et ça me donne l'eau à la bouche
Mais quand j'ai voulu me tirer, tu as joué cette cartouche
Il y a des points d'interrogations dans tes « je t'aime »
Des fois, la vérité parle d'elle-même
Mentir ne sert à rien et puis ça me fout le blues
De faire de toi une mère, mais pas une épouse
Regards éberlués quand le testeur vire au bleu
Trouver une raison pour qu'on reste ensemble
Certains se créent des problèmes, d'autres s'en inventent
Quand tu m'as dit d'avoir une tombe dans le ventre
Je me suis senti coupable et misérable
Incapable de t'aimer après l'inconcevable

Give me a chance / give me a chance 
Don't want a distance
Teach me how to fall in love
Want you to touch me baby

Déjà, il y a les gestes qui ne trompent pas
Des regards qui ne trichent pas
Des mots maladroits
Si mes « je t'aime » attendent une réponse
Savoir si tu y renonces
Si tu es sûr de toi
Des « je te rappelle » qui veulent dire adieu
Pour être parents, il faut être deux
Les remords nous dévorent
Pour savoir qui a raison, qui a tort

Want you to touch me baby
Teach me how to fall in love
Want you to touch me baby

On se moquait des gens qui restaient ensemble par habitude
Même si tout les oppose, par peur de la solitude
Donc, par définition, tous les couples sont mixtes
C'est qu'à travers le compromis qu'ils existent
Tu m'as piégé avec tes putains de chantage
Comme un con j'en ai oublié mes protections d'usage
Hormis le sexe tout laisse à désirer
Quand la passion devient une obsession et l'amour de la charité
Donc j'ai refusé froidement
De donner mes sentiments contre un mariage blanc
Mais une histoire de cul, une histoire de chiffons
Une histoire de papiers rangés avec les torchons
On est des faiseurs d'ange qui se brûlent les ailes
A rêver comme dans les Sims d'une famille en pixel
300 euros pour se racheter une conduite
300 euros pour que l'on prenne la fuite",Coup de Gaz

cette lettre a fait apparition A renforcé mes sentiments pour ma mère d'adoption Moi le gosse qui volait dans son sac à
main Falsifiait sa signature dans ses bulletins À mentir pour un rien, patience volatile Elle m'a donné des valeurs
indélébiles Quand en tant que noir, on doit bosser 3 fois plus Que notre avenir est dans la Bible ou dans les syllabus
Qu'on ne sera jamais égaux, même à compétences égales Que si la liberté a un prix, c'est celui du minerval Vu d'ici,
l'Europe est un port de plaisance Où les porcs se dépensent le coeur à la place de la panse Mais c'est franchement
caricatural Comme les conseils des assistants sociaux Sur les familles monoparentales Celui qui reste, tient les 2 rôles
primordiaux Comme dos à dos

Is the one time 
When I miss you 
And I wish that you were with me 
And I sit and 
I think of you 
And I'm lost in 
Forgotten old memories of you

Wish you were here with me 
I wish you were here with me 
Wish you were here with me 
I wish you were here with me 

Night-time 
Comes seeping 
Through my window 
And I know I should be sleeping 
But I'm thinking 
Of the last time 
Can you hear me 
Do you know my hopes are sinking 

Cause the night-time 
Is the one time 
When I miss you 
And I wish that you were with me 
And I sit and 
I think of you 
And I'm lost in 
Forgotten old memories of you

And I'm always thinking of you 
And I'm always thinking of you 
And I'm always dreaming of you 
Always I'm weeping in dreams

It was a still hot day
I was sitting doing nothing
When I saw him cruising by
He looked kinda mean
On his devil machine
As he turned and he winked his eye

He's got tact
And he knows how to use it
I fell for him
When I first saw him cruising
I couldn't help it
It was none of my choosing
But I'm so glad
And I don't wanna lose him
He's got tact
And he knows how to use it
I fell for him
When I first saw him crusing
I couldnt seem
To get him outta my head
He stole my heart away

Later that night
I got into a fight
With a girl who said ""He's mine""
I pulled him aside
Said he'd better decide
He said ""Love me now its no crime""

Dancing barefoot in the sand 
Close your eyes and take me 
To the promised land 

Bolt the windows and close the door 
Now there's nothing worth living for 
New direction is hard to find 
So leave me behind 

Dim the lights and hang up the phone 
All I want is to be alone 
No connection with anyone 
I just can't go on

The last time I saw your face 
I heard you cry 
Terrified 
When they took you to another place 

But now I can see you smile 
There's a wall that divides us 
Never forgive 
The right to live 
And all the love that they deny us

And I'm gonna find you baby 
So you better start running 
Ready or not I'm coming 
And I'm gonna get to you 
No matter what they do 
Ready or not I'm coming 
Creeping up behind you baby 
Let me tell you something 
Ready or not I'm coming 
Bringing all my love to you 
But am I getting through? 

Am I getting through? 
I send all my love to you 
One chance to make it through 
Shadows fall 
Can't hear me call 
But my heart goes out to you

I'll never give up the fight 
Never be satisfied 
Till we stand

Touching freedom on the other side

No complications
In a perfect world

Ooh, la la la la la la ah

His day is over it's just another night
The same old faces always pass him by
His heart is willing but the world's so cold
Oh how he longs for someone real to hold

She takes the bus home to her usual place
All kinds of people but they leave no trace
She knows by now that dreams are not enough
All she wanted was someone real to love

And just as surely as the sun will rise
Each one knows that there'll be no surprise
Yet still each day they live in hope and try for more
There must be someone who's worth dying for

All we need is understanding love is easy
When boy meets girl maybe tomorrow we'll try again
No complications in a perfect world

Ooh, la la la la la la ah

All we need is understanding love is easy
When boy meets girl maybe tomorrow we'll try again

So I'll drop by would that be cool

What you want me to do
Makes me feel alright
The way that you drum me
The way that you bass me

And polish up your engine

Bananarama,"Had this feeling lately
I just can't get you off my mind
When I see you, you make me
Make me lose all sense of time

When you hold me, baby
You turn my world upside down, yeah
When you touch me, oh baby
My feet don't even touch the ground

I found love, yeah
I've got a lover who gives me more
The kind of love I've never found before
'Cause I need no other when you're around
'Cause the love I've found takes me higher

I was thinking maybe
Am I going much too fast
But something tells me, oh baby
I've got a love that's gonna last

When you're with me, it's easy
You make me feel so good inside
I can love you completely
This time I know I've got it right

I found love, yeah
I've got a lover who gives me more
The kind of love I've never found before
'Cause I need no other when you're around
'Cause the love I've found takes me higher

I, I, I

I found love, yeah

Bananarama,"Never trust your own emotions
They'll always let you down
And the one that's closest to you
May not always be around

I never questioned
The promises you made
Every time I gave my heart
I was betrayed

What a fool
That I should ever believe
In love, truth and honesty
All the time
You just keep on hurting me

Maybe everyone's a stranger
I watch them come and go
But I think everyone's in danger
If they let their feelings show

There's a lesson
And a price you have to pay
If you give your heart
Dont let it be betrayed

What a fool
That I should ever believe
In love, truth and honesty
All the time
You just keep on hurting me

What a fool
Every time I find I'm deceived
Where is the love, truth and honesty
If you see it
Won't you bring it on home to me

When love bites there's no place left to go
I can't fight this feeling in my soul
Is it obvious
It's killing me
You're destroying me

Never made a wish that never came true
Never took a chance til I met you

Gets under your skin and it won't go away
Can nothing save me when love bites

As the darkness comes around 
I tried to let you know 
You're going the wrong way

Would all be paved with gold 
But when the wind cuts through 
You'd even try to sell your soul 
Everywhere you go

Walking through danger 
Can't see the wrong or the right 
Whatcha doing, tell me whatcha doing

Must be a trick of the night 

Well its a laugh a minute 
And you can't decide 
Between the burning question 
And the fortune in his eyes 
You never let it show 
Or take it the wrong way 

Sometimes you wonder 
What you came here for 
Oh, they could tear you apart 
With those bare faced lies 
Can't disguise 
All the hurt you're feeling inside

Banco de Gaia,"There's a pulsating white light but it's beautiful

It's like a tunnel of colors
And it's like I'm floating up
Through a tunnel of colors

They move and they flow into each other
And sometimes they mix
And sometimes they don't

They're changing and it looks like
They're flowing through each other
And on top of each other and sometimes mixing
And making the colors and sometimes not

Will I be able to fly through the different colors?

The ounce of perfection
You worried away
After our reflections
Of yesterday, yesterday, today

There's no need to be afraid
At Christmas-time we let in light and we banish shade
And in our world of plenty we can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world at Christmas-time
But - say a prayer - pray for the other ones
At Christmas-time it's hard but when you're having fun
There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear
Where the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears
And the Christmas-bells that ring
There are the clanging chimes of door
Well
Tonight thank God it's them instead of you
And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas-time
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life
Oh
Where nothing ever grows
No rain or rivers flow
Do they know it's Christmas-time at all?
Here's to you

Here's to them underneath that burning sun
