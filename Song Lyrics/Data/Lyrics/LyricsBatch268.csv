Liege Lord,"A tailored suit of terror
Rains from the sky
Made of us all
Thousands will die

Burning, surrounding, nowhere to hide
But they're looking for those
Who can't see the light, yeah

A vast cry of outrage
Raises its head
A little too late
Thousands are dead

Burning, surrounding, nowhere to hide
But they're looking for those
Who can't see the light, yeah

[Chorus:]
(In the eye) of the storm

If we don't act now, then actors we'll be
Playing the part of life's insanity

[Repeat chorus]

Burning, surrounding, nowhere to hide
But they're looking for those
Who can't see the light, again, & again & again

You better not ever, 
Get caught dead lying in the
Eye of the storm",Eye of the Storm
Liege Lord,"I tried to escape, fallout
All around me, yeah

The blast of light, burning day and night
It would last through time, 
with an unseen spark of life

Man and his infamy, man will no longer be
Fallout is his breath of air
The stars above glance fateful stares

Looking back I'd wonder why
No one helped, they'd just stand by
They need to look the other way
To breed the fallout, the final day

The blast of light, a laugh at our fright
The fallout ending time, the fallout far and wide

Man and his infamy, man will no longer be
Speak of man in the past tense
Speak of man who made no sense

Who believes in leadership?
Armed to the teeth, he's well equipped
Well bestowed since man's birth
Hell below, hell on earth

Come and see the show, 
Said the stars as they gazed below
See the fallout strip away their future and all their
yesterdays

Man and his infamy, man will no longer be
Fallout is their breath of air
The stars above watch from their lair

The blast of light, burning day and night
It would last trough time 
with an unseen spark of life

Man and his infamy, man will no longer be
Fallout is his breath of air
The stars above glance fateful stares

Who on earth wants to hear a rhyme?
Of the end of birth, of the end of time
Hear these words, don't wonder why",Fallout
Liege Lord,"Into the madness, and back out of sight
Like ten thousand strong, we burn on through the night
An endless vision, carries us through life
The fear that breaks down all the rest
Dares not to doubt our might

A vein of violence, bleeds pulse into our veins
Always when the smoke is clear, 
Our union still remains
We're opposition, oppressors of the norm
The fear that seems to flourish
Shall always be ignored

[Chorus]
Fear, it tempts our lives
There's nothing to fear
It's just a lie
Fear, it's in yourself
There's nothing to fear
But fear itself

Hear the losers, their tears won't dry
The beggars and choosers, afraid to die
To last nine lives, but while we're here
We don't run or hide

[Chorus]

In this life, there comes a time
When the fear around you, takes you off your stride
With two cold faces of low and high
Follow us, we'll help you decide
You'll never know if you never try

[Chorus]",Fear Itself
Liege Lord,"Looks in the mirror, thinks he knows what he sees
Hides the truth from himself
Not from you or me, check it

Acts like a dog, always take the easy way
You can't live forever without responsibility

Always in the action
And he knows which ways to go
The best way to break him is to break down his road

[Chorus]
Feel the blade, he's living a lie
feel the blade, he's wondering why
Feel the blade, why can't he see
That he'll feel the blade from me

His dreams have been ended, cut him down to size
His dreams have been ended, maybe he'll realize

He thought he'd live forever, for all eternity
He can't lead anything, nothing comes for free

[Chorus: x2]

Feel the Blade",Feel the Blade
Liege Lord,"Danger, danger Queen's about to kill
There's a stranger, stranger - and life about to spill
Oh no! Move me out of harm
I need a spell and a charm, Fly like the wind
I'm a pawn, so be gone, speed on and on

Kill the King, tear him down
Kill the King, strike him down

Treason, treason the spectre looms again
treason, reason the realm is safe and then
Oh no! Move away from harm
I need a spell and a charm, Fly like the rainbow
I'm a pawn, so be gone, speed on and on

Kill the King, tear him down
Kill the King, go take his crown down

Kill the King
He'll rule no more, strike him dead
The people roar
Kill the King, take his head
Down, down, down, down
Oh kill, oh kill, oh kill, oh oh",Kill the King
Liege Lord,"When far futures calling and your needs at hand
I'll be your creation, with you I'm hand in hand
Since my automation I've learned to think for man
Now you're not able to shut down my master plan

Once you'd crowd around me, marvel young and old
Our machine brings us peace, now we are one and bold
Who'd think that perhaps 
Your trust would soon collapse?
Life and death as a whole under machines control

Tell me children, It's I who lead your lives
Tell me children, I am supreme device
Tell me children, I will outlive your cries
Tell me children, I'm whose voice never dies

Minds of known construction please unite as one
Or taste our own destruction 
In the hands of what we've done
While you point and blame 
At who first turned my switch
I plan feats of terror to unthread you stitch by stitch

Tell me children, It's I who lead your lives
Tell me children, I am supreme device
Tell me children, I will outlive your cries
Tell me children, I'm whose voice never dies

[Chorus]
Power and depth, infinity
Master Control, machinery
Complex and endless, infinity
Master Control, machinery
Pulse of pure metal, infinity
Master Control, machinery

Now retaliation, we are face to face
I submerge each nation, reveal my newest race
The thrill of revelation, my arms out of hand
And all your sins remembered to test machine and man

Tell me children, It's I who lead your lives
Tell me children, I am supreme device
Tell me children, I will outlive your cries
Tell me children, I'm whose voice never dies

[Chorus]

Upon the day of our people are weak and astray
This selfish destiny with man to lead the way
When far futures calling mankind can't play the fool
Don't leave our distant children 
A world unfair and cruel

Tell me children, It's I who lead your lives
Tell me children, I am supreme device
Tell me children, I will outlive your cries
Tell me children, I'm whose voice never dies

[Chorus]",Master Control
Liege Lord,"Immense and whole the power 
Of a dream that has come true
Her strength held back the hours
And spread shadow on the truth
Destiny's daughter, her fatal beauty speaks
Now I taste the experience of her lies and self deceit

[Chorus]
(Rapture) Beginning of the end
(Rapture) Be ready to defend

In the flesh commanding passion, 
Glaring lust into my eyes
I'm blinded by her spirit, not yet knowing her disguise
And I know that deep inside, 
When my trust becomes a fact
I'll pull out, she'll pull away And stab me in the back

[Chorus]

Commanding with action
Like a fever driven molten spike
I drill her till her skin can crawl
Then she sets me up for the fall

[Chorus]

Immense and whole power
Of a dream that has come true
Overwhelming, never ending
Brings the fever out in you
Away you'll wail, until you're pail
With a craze of passion flow
When it ends it all depends 
Get in or you'll never know

[Chorus]",Rapture
Liege Lord,"Do you suspect your brother, was something done to you?
We all trust one another, we know this isn't true
For the people's minds are cluttered
With the word we call dislike
When our backs are turned in friendship
Our brothers they will strike

Across the seas in another land
Fists are clenched in every hand
Step across the boundary line
My choice to live is no longer mine
Suspicion drill inside their heads
And the will to live is what we dread
Man's trust has surely died
On the sword's point suspicion glides

[Chorus]
Can you control the feeling that you hold
The others you neglect, feel your own suspect

Between two fires we collect our thoughts
Are we all just liars? And our truth is only bought
For it's suspicion that turns it's back on you
Suspicion in the masses down to the very few
You cannot trust your brother
For the fear he's after you

[Chorus]

Between two fires we collect our thoughts
Are we all just liars? And our truth is only bought
For it's suspicion that turns it's back on you
They close their eyes to their own demise
And pray that it's not true",Suspicion
Life,"(1) 
Took my love 
Into overdrive 
Custom pink 
Tonight you'll pay the price 

When she's hot 
Well damn she's hot 
Electric love 
Like Sandra Dee 

Should have seen her dance 

[Chorus:] 
Come on and dance 
Come on baby 
Come on and dance 

(2) 
Fast and slick 
Well she's cool and clean 
In a Pepsi sheen 
She's a leather tease 

When she's on top 
Well you can't be stopped 
Watch her scream 
Watch her suck you clean 

And you should've seen her dance

Life After Life,"Still is still moving to me
I swim like a fish in the sea
All the time
But if that's what it takes to be free
I don't mind
Still is still moving to me
Still is still moving to me

And it's hard to explain how I feel
It won't go in words
But I know that it's real
I can be moving or I can be still
But still is still moving to me
Still is still moving to me",Still Is Still Moving to Me [*]
Life in Your Way,"My voice fell at the word of yours in my heart
My shallow ideas fall far before your feet
To know all of these would be to know your hand
But my frailty uncovers what I really am not what I mean to be
Sear my heart to you and sear my eyes
All these scars keep me from seeing clearly
I am broken crying and falling for you
Take this confusion away
Show this new road show me the way past my own strength
As though I have no hope again as though you have never taken me in
Like a child with his hands to his father I come uncovered
I'm in need of you more than ever",Fall
Life in Your Way,"You are beautiful amazing
Our friendship is ever growing
A never ending journey
I hold you in the highest a place that no other will touch
These days we've been back and forth so it's all or nothing now
This is our story our testimony and strength to push forward
May we constantly see with eyes of pure thought
You have been a part of who I am
It will never be forgotten
Us together us forever
This bond will not be broken",Meant to Be
Life in Your Way,"This road is worn it's a long walk to home
Rest seems lost on my own
The world has no mercy for me
All I need is something to live for and stand by

A love that's true
I have passion for freedom
I want truth to set me free
This is where my feet slip

Where's my devotion to you?
What's truth. belief?
The point that stands
Beginning, reason

It's the breaking of a heart
I've been put down and let down
But I've been touched cared for and held onto
Cried many times ""make this right""

Words were whispered ""then change your fight""
All these things tie me down
""Hope deferred make the heart sick""
So keep me strong and sleeping on through the night",My Devotion
Life in Your Way,"Here we are unfaithful with our words
Choices made that separate life and love leaving empty eyes and
Hands that dare not touch the truth
Honestly dishonest this selfish pursuit buried deep in a discord of faith

While not concerned with their hearts (here we are unfaithful with our words)
Discoveries overlooked entirely
What's in my mind what's written on my heart
What's remembered no more

The old is obsolete and the new will make the old soon disappear
Though I feel wicked we can give good things
May my wealth be found and be worthy of my duty
I call for change to end this life I long only to hold true

To be a witness held by goodness held back by conviction
I truly am blowing in the wind
Without you holding me there would be nothing left to speak of
Even though I feel that I am less than the least can I sing in the shadows of your wings

Where else might I sing but in the shadows of your wings?
Where else might I hide but in the shadows of your wings?
Where else?",Not a Word
Life in Your Way,"There is a movement, a movement in the air
Can you feel it? 
Let them know this is the last time
We're taking over",The Change
Life in Your Way,"I will never sleep again the way that I have now
I will never close my eyes
It has taken me this long to get this far
It has taken me this long to get this far
It has taken me so long to get this far
Now I'm breaking through, making waves and smashing against the shoreline
Breaking through, making waves and smashing against the shoreline
Now I'm staying on track this time
Forward motion is good
Now I'm staying on track this time
Forward motion is good
Free from guilt, over it all 
This is my commitment
I’ll live and let redemption see me through 

What a world wants to hold me down 
I’m standing firm
What a world wants to hold me down 
I’m standing firm
I’m standing firm
It feels so good

Life of Agony,"A little older, little wiser
With every breath I learn just a little more
And with all I've seen
I've finally made up my mind

Enough of, of this world
Enough blood in these eyes
I'm so, so, so sick of this life

It's about time being I realized
Release this hate from inside
Enough blood in my eyes

Call it what, you can will
Call it suicide
Disregard how you feel
I'm just freeing my mind
Clench my teeth as I sleep
So, so, so sick of this life, yea
Cannot take, cannot fake
Can't shake this blood from these eyes

All I have and all I will be
Nevertheless I'll live for all eternity
'Cause you can erase my words
Can't erase my mind

You can't wipe out my thoughts
Can't shake this blood from my eyes
So, so, so, so don't even try
Just give me one good reason to live
I'll give you three to die

Cast away whatever
Wrapped up and tied in a knot

I'm out of my head again
I'm out of my head again

Honeycombs
And Cinnamon untied again
It's the greatest, greatest
Honeycomb a child should hold

Life of Agony,"If you don't walk with me, I will walk alone
Hard enough to believe in myself
When I know they don't believe in me
Unwilling to change for society

I'll be who I want to be

Get my aggression out
This is what we're here for, control the dance floor

This is why we're here
I said, this is why we're here
So when will it end, when will it end
When will they comprehend, comprehend

That we will overcome this system
I said this is why we're here
They keep on kicking me down, kicking me down
Tryin' to keep me underground, underground

But did I mention we were paving the way
For the new breed of bad seed

Screamin' these words, screamin' these words

'Til every voice is heard, voice is heard
They keep on screamin' these words, screamin' these words

Unwilling to change for society
We'll be who we want to be

Lifehouse,"Find me here, and speak to me
I want to feel you, I need to hear you
You are the light that's leading me to the place
Where I find peace again
You are the strength that keeps me walking
You are the hope that keeps me trusting
You are the life to my soul
You are my purpose
You're everything
And how can I stand here with you
And not be moved by you
Would you tell me how could it be any better than this?

You calm the storms and you give me rest
You hold me in your hands
You won't let me fall
You steal my heart and you take my breath away
Would you take me in, take me deeper now
And how can I stand here with you and not be moved by you
Would you tell me how could it be any better than this
And how can I stand here with you and not be moved by you
Would you tell me how could it be any better than this

Cause you're all I want, you're all I need
You're everything, everything
You're all I want
You're all I need
You're everything, everything
You're all I want
You're all I need

And how can I stand here with you and not be moved by you
Would you tell me how could it be any better than this
And how can I stand here with you and not be moved by you
Would you tell me how could it be any better-any better than this

Starving for truth
I'm Closer to where I Started
Chasing after you

I'm falling even more in love with you
Letting go of all I've held onto
I'm standing here until you make me move
I'm hanging by a moment here with you

Forgetting all I'm lacking
Completely incomplete
I'll take your invitation
You take all of me

Now I'm falling even more in love with you
Letting go of all I've held onto
I'm standing here until you make me move

I'm livin' for the only thing I know
I'm running here and I'm not quite sure
Where to go?
And down I know I'd like to be in tune
Just hanging by a moment here with you

There's nothing else to lose
There's nothing left to fly
There is nothing in the world that can change my mind
There is nothing else
There is nothing else

Lifehouse,"She's got a pretty smile it covers up the poison
That she hides she walks around in circles in my head
Waiting for the chance to break me chance to take me down
Well I see the burden you gave me
It's too much to carry it's too much to bury inside
I guess you're the only one
Nobody changes I guess you're the only one
That's still doing everything else ...
You're still the only one yeah you're still the only one
Wisdom shallow oh so peeling
Now I'm up to my ankles and I'm drowning
Away in a sea sarcastic faces familiar places
Everything that's quite the same it's all confusing ...
Amusing literally tainted a picture you've painted to me
I guess you're the only one
Nobody changes I guess you're the one
That's still doing when everything else goes down
You're still the only one
We never change faces
I guess you're the only one that's still doing
Everything else goes down
Just cause the sounds in your head
Doesn't mean it has to be in mine
Don't believe what you said still can't get it out of my mind
I've tried to find myself in approval
I've already been there already done that
It got me no where it brought me nothing
But a good place to hide in no one to confide in
Now I guess you're the only one
Nobody changes I guess you're the only one
That will never change faces
I guess you're the only one",Only One

And I'll be real honesty 
Won't be a pain

Your approval to find 
My worth I've been trapped 
Inside of my own 

Mind afraid to open 
My eyes to what I'd 
Find I don't want to 
Live like this anymore 

There goes my pain there 
Goes my chains did you 
See them fall there 
Goes this feeling that 

Has no meaning there 
Goes the world off 
Of my shoulders there 
Goes the world off of 

My back there it goes 
Does it scare you that 
I can be something 
Different than you 

Would it make you 
Feel more comfortable 
If I wasn't you can't 
Control me you can't 

Take away from me who 
I am have you ever felt 
That your only comfort 
Was your cage you're not 

Alone I have felt the 
Same as you have you ever 
Felt like your secrets 
Give you away you're not 

Alone I have been there, 
Too everyone is looking 
And everybody is laughing 
But I think everyone feels 

The same everybody wants 
To feel okay everybody 
Wants to everybody wants 
To feel 'cause you can't

Off of my shoulders there 
Goes the world off of

I tried to climb your steps
I tried to chase you down
I tried to see how low I could get down to the ground
I tried to earn my way
I tried to tame this mind
You better believe that I tried to beat this

So when will this end
It goes on and on
Over and over and over again
Keep spinning around i know that it won't stop
Till I step down from this for good

I never thought I'd end up here
I never thought Id be standing where I am
I guess a kind of thought it would be easier than this I guess
I was wrong now one more time

Lifehouse,"Catch your breath hit the wall scream out loud as you start to crawl back in
Your cage the only place where they will leave you alone 'cause the weak will
Seek the weaker until they've broken them could you get it back again
Would it be the same fulfillment to their lack of strength
At your expense left you with no defense they tore it down and i have
Felt the same as you, I've felt the same as you, I've felt the same
Locked inside the only place where you feel sheltered where you feel safe
You lost yourself in your search to find something else to hide behind
The fearful always preyed upon your confidence

Did they see the consequence when they pushed you around
The arrogant build kingdoms made of the different ones
Breaking them 'til they've become just another crown
Refuse to feel, Anything at all refuse to slip, Refuse to
Fall can't be weak, Can't stand still you watch your back,
'Cause no one will you don't know why they had to go
This far traded your worth for these scars for your only
Company don't believe the lies that they told to you
Not one word was true you're alright, You're alright,
You're alright",Simon
Lifehouse,"Can't change this feeling I'm way out of touch 
Can't change this meaning it means too much
Never been this lonely never felt so good
Can't be the only one misunderstood I remind myself of somebody else
Feeling like I'm chasing like I'm facing myself alone
I've got somebody else's thoughts in my head I want some of my own
I want some of my own I want some of my own

Can you see me up here would you bring me back down
Cause I've been living to see my fears as they fall to the ground
I remind myself of somebody else
Feeling like I'm chasing like I'm facing myself alone
I've got somebody else's thoughts in my head I want some of my own

Lifehouse,"I can't meet
Losing sleep over this
No I can't
And now I cannot stop pacing
Give me a few hours
I'll have this all sorted out
If my mind would just stop racing

Cause I cannot stand still
I can be this unsturdy
This cannot be happening

This is over my head
But underneath my feet
Cause by tomorrow morning I'll have this thing beat
And everything will be back to the way that it was
I wish that it was just that easy

Cause I'm waiting for tonight
Been waiting for tomorrow
I'm somewhere in between
What is real, just a dream [Repeat: x2]

Would you catch me if I fall out of what I fell in
don't be surprised if I collapse down at your feet again
I don't want to run away from this
I know that I just don't need this

Whitewashed everything
When all that remains are
Shadows of the stains
Tell me
Where did we go wrong
Can we just move on

Hello
From the world below
While I'm watching the sun burning
As the road is slowly turning
When I know
That in letting go
I'm learning how to live
Through a life I have to give

Hello
To the world below
While I'm watching the world spinning
This night seems so unending
Well I'll follow
To a place I know
That's only the beginning
Start over after ending",The Beginning

How many times will history repeat it
How long will it take

How long

I want to go
Will you show me the way

I'd rather be wrong than be deceived
To thinking that I believe
That I can stand to be here on my own

In hopes that this too will pass

Past the shadows hanging on the walls
It's been a long time since I felt the stain
Of yesterday getting in my way

I'm alive but tell me am I free
I got eyes but tell me can I see
The sky is falling and no one knows
It shouldn't be hard to believe
Shouldn't be this difficult to breathe
The sky is falling and no one knows

You leave me hanging on only to catch my breath
I got you and I got nothing left
Don't leave me all alone down here

It's gonna be just fine
You're holding on
Holding on today

Things don't stop and the others announced they're moving on
Salt & tears in the minds in the mouths of a bad decision
Too late for another mistake it's bringing me down
With all your faults it isn't your fault

I watched helpless as he turned around to leave
And still I have the pain I have to carry
A past so deep that even you could not bury if you tried

After all this time
I never thought we'd be here
Never thought we'd be here
When my love for you was blind
But I couldn't make you see it
Couldn't make you see it
That I loved you more than you'll ever know
A part of me died when I let you go

I would fall asleep
Only in hopes of dreaming
That everything would be like is was before
But nights like this it seems are slowly fleeting
They disappear as reality is crashing to the floor

After all this time
I never thought we'd be here

Make some sense out of this madness will it turn out right
Who's to say where the wind will blow

Time will tell us if we're out of answers when it stops
Climb back down to the beginning
Take it from the top
Who's to say where the wind will blow

What happens when all your dreams are lying on the ground
Do you pick up the pieces all around
And if the world should fall apart hold on to what you know
Take your chances turn around and go

All the leaves are turning and the sky fades to gray
Strange our life coincides with the seasons of today
Who's to say where the wind will blow

What happens when everything is lying on the ground
Do you pick up the pieces all around

And if the world should fall apart hold on to what you know
Take your chances turn around and go

Carry on you say
Bring the best of today
All I see is struggling on the way

Maybe when the sun crashes through the gray
I can find the strength to make it through the day
Through the day

What happens when all your dreams are lying on the ground
Do you pick up the pieces all around

And if the world should fall apart hold on to what you know

When I'm with you I'm high
Instead of hiding my face
My minds in your eyes
Can your love embrace me as I am?

In the silence you stare at the world
Your eyes are screaming to be heard

When time is not on my side
All we have is now

Feel your breath against my pains
I breath out
The past is gone
Empty smile
Make it hard
Who I was, falls apart
When you're here
Inside of me
Feel till your no depth perception becoming the new different door

I'm losing myself just to find a place in your mind
In your mind
Changing myself, just to stand alone in your eyes
In your eyes
Pull me in, take me out, make me over

Read the wave, ride your fears
In this ocean of tears, leave them here
Swimming off
Take me deep, till I find
Every corner of your mind

We've been here
Swimming off
Take, just a taste of the time
We are wasting alone
Waiting here

I'm losing myself just to find a place in your mind
In your mind
Changing myself, just to stand alone in your eyes
In your eyes
Pull me in, take me out, make me over

And shout me out loud, shout me out loud

I'm losing myself just to find a place in your mind

This darkness would turn to light

And you will catch me if I fall
And I will get lost into your eyes

I know everything will be alright
I know everything is alright

I know you didn't bring me out here to drown
So why am I ten feet under and upside down?
Barely surviving has become my purpose
Because I'm so used to living underneath the surface

If I could just see you
Everything would be all right

You gotta let me inside even though it hurts
Don't hide the broken parts that I need to see

As sure as the sun going down
I'll always be around
I'll always be around

I'm afraid of living here without you
My years were made to wrap my life around you
When I'm away, our souls are tied

As sure as the waves crash to the shore
I'll always be yours
I'll always be yours, oh

I'm in the dark, and there's a light that's shining
In Central Park, where all the ghosts are hiding
This city spark starts to fade

As sure as there are stars up above
You'll always be loved

And as sure as gravity pulling us down
I'll always be around
I'll always be around",Central Park

I see your eyes, hear your voice
Outside my window
Calling for me in a time of trouble
And you know I'd be there

warm warm feelings
sometimes there's nothing else alive
your living your breathing your bitching even more
your tunnel and all its darkness what is the act all for alive ",Alive
Lifetime,"I fight to keep afloat I go under none the less
I fight for a breath of air search but it's not there
In this sea of people I find I am not an equal
I'm not satisfied should my dreams be denied
Catch me at a good time see a man with a purpose
Otherwise you'll find me with the rest blending into the background
I want to kick myself but I'm busy resting
I wonder why I complain when I'm equally to blame
Hardcore is not a background beat for you to move your dancing feet
Its feeling living breathing its the life for those who love living its outrage
Energy compassion not hate not violence or fashion
So I ask you and I'm left to wonder
What you'll do when you've dragged it under
Find who's to blame the ones who destroy or the ones who let it happen



",Background
Lifetime,"I'd love to stick out my tongue and catch the rain in my mouth
But never take the time
I see you I want to tell you maybe a hello see if things worked out for you
I'd love to but never do let me get under your covers
Let me hide away from all my loose ends
They just pile on I try to find out where the road begins
It's like turning on the brights on a fog filled night
If I had to do I'd keep my friends I remember me
And frog walking through town
Drunk as hell no regrets but better days ahead fall asleep my flower bed

Lifetime,"Here she comes again my old friend emptiness faithfully by my side
No dividing us its funny how she comes around like clockwork
When I hit the ground
I try to concentrate and stretch a smile across my face
You are the one to set the sun
And then your coldness lingers on grab the clouds from out of sight
Turn our morning into night
You're the cold flowing through my veins that turns my laughter to a scream
And everytime we think it's done you're right behind us listening on

But of course I'll call you tonight.
Did you know you missed my birthday?
The loneliest it gets is when the wind begins to chill.

And when I stand at the top of your old street,
The church top brings a stillness to me.
And I can't think of anything I'd rather do
Than have my heart broken by you.

Could we be saved by inventions and hopes?
Cause I'm not all right.
The night seems to swallow me whole
And spits out second guessing.

I remember ever since that first day that I saw you on the street.
I've always wanted you in the worst way, but now I can't compete.
And I'm so... and you're so... we're both so all fucked up.
I don't know but what to do.

It just makes me want to scream.
Isn't it about time that we try and get it right.
'Cause I can't sleep on no more floors
And I can't stay up no more nights.

Urlando contro il cielo

Non saremo delle star
Ma siam noi, con questi giorni
Fatti di ore andate per
Un weekend e un futuro che non c'è
Non si può sempre perdere
Per cui giochiamoci
Certe luci non puoi spegnerle

Se e' un purgatorio e' nostro perlomeno.
Urlando contro il cielo

Fantasmi sulla A14.
Dai finestrini passa odor di mare, diesel,
Merda, morte e vita
Il patto e' stringerci di più
Prima di perderci
Forse ci sentono lassù
E' un po' come sputare via il veleno.
Urlando contro il cielo
Contro il cielo

Soddisfatti o no qua non rimborsano mai 
E calendari a chiederci se 
Stiamo prendendo abbastanza, abbastanza 
Se per ogni sbaglio avessi mille lire 
Che vecchiaia che passerei 
Strade troppo strette e diritte 
Per chi vuol cambiar rotta oppure sdraiarsi un po' 
Che andare va bene, pero' a volte serve un motivo un motivo 
Certi giorni ci chiediamo : ""E' tutto qui?"" 
E la risposta e' sempre si'! 
Non e' tempo per noi 
Che non ci svegliamo mai 
Abbiam sogni pero' troppo grandi e belli sai 
Belli o brutti abbiam facce 
Che pero' non cambian mai 
Non e' tempo per noi e forse non lo sara' mai 
Se un bel giorno passi di qua 
Lasciati amare e poi scordati presto di me 
Che quel tempo e' gia' buono per amare 
Qualchedun'altro, qualche altro 
Dicono che noi ci stiamo buttando via 
Ma siam bravi a raccoglierci 
Non e' tempo per noi 
Che non ci adeguiamo mai 
Fuori moda, fuori posto 
Insomma sempre fuori, dai 
Abbiam donne pazienti, rassegnate ai nostri guai 
Non e' tempo per noi 
E forse non lo sara' mai 
Non e' tempo per noi 
Che non vestiamo come voi 
Non ridiamo, non piangiamo, non amiamo come voi 
Forse ingenui o testardi 
Poco furbi, casomai 
Non e' tempo per noi 
E forse non lo sara' mai.

Che quando smetti di sperare inizi un po' a morire

Pesan sempre un po' di piu'
Di sabbia, terra e polvere
Che non si staccan piu'.
Un fiore ogni tre vite
Ed un fiore che, poi,
Sara' robusto ed alto,
Si, ma profumato mai.
Le bestie nel deserto
Hanno cuori lenti che,
Che segnano la danza
Per le nuvole.
Il sangue resta freddo
Purche' il sole resti li',
Ma due o tre piogge servono
Per occhi umidi.

Faccia un poco d'ombra tu.
A meno che
Il sole non mi accechi piu'.
A meno che non butti via le bussole,
Bruci le mie bussole.
Il cielo sul deserto
Chiama acqua pure lui:
Snobbato dagli angeli,
Volato da avvoltoi
E torbido di spiriti
Che spesso giocano,
In sella al vento fischiano
E poi ululano.

Faccia un poco d'ombra tu.

Ligabue,"Ho ancora la forza che serve a camminare
Picchiare ancora contro per non lasciarmi stare
Ho ancora quella forza che ti serve
Quando dici, ""Si comincia""

E ho ancora la forza di guardarmi attorno
Mischiando le parole con due pacchetti al giorno
Di farmi trovar l da chi mi vuole
Sempre nella mia camicia

Abito sempre qui da me
In questa stessa strada che non sai mai se c'?
E al mondo sono andato
Dal mondo son tornato sempre vivo

Ho ancora la forza di starvi a raccontare
Le mie storie di sempre, di come posso amare
Di tutti quegli sbagli che per un
Motivo o l'altro so rifare

E ho ancora la forza di chiedere anche scusa
O di incazzarmi ancora con la coscienza offesa
Di dirvi che comunque la mia parte
Ve la posso garantire

Abito sempre qui da me
In questa stessa strada che non sai mai se c'?
Nel mondo sono andato
Dal mondo son tornato sempre vivo

Ho ancora la forza di non tirarmi indietro
Di scegliermi la vita masticando ogni metro
Di far la conta degli amici andati e dire
""Ci vediam pi tardi""

E ho ancora la forza di scegliere parole
Per gioco, per il gusto di potermi sfogare
Perch, che piaccia o no, capitato
Che sia quello che so fare

Abito sempre qui da me
In questa stessa strada che non sai mai se c'?
Col mondo sono andato
E col mondo son tornato sempre vivo

E che se ne frega delle nuvole,
Mentre qui manchi tu.
Pomeriggio spompo di Domenica, come fanno gli altri a stare sù, non arriva neanche un po di musica, quando qui manchi tu.
E adesso che sei, dovunque sei, chissà se ti arriva il mio pensiero!
Chissà se ne ridi o se ti fa piacere.

Cosa see'entra quel tramonto inutile, non ha l'aria di finire più,
E ci tiene a dare il suo spettacolo mentre qui, manchi tu.
Cosi solo da provare panico e see'è qualcun'altra qui con me,
Devo avere proprio un'aria stupida,
Sai com'è...MANCHI TE.
E adesso che sei, dovunque sei, chissà se ti arriva il mio pensiero!
Chissà se ne ridi o se ti fa piacere.
E adesso che sei, dovunque sei, ridammelo indietro il mio pensiero,
Dev'esserci un modo per non lasciarmi andare.

Cosa see'entra questa notte giovane
Non mi cambia niente la tv
E che tristezza che mi fa quel comico..
Quando qui manchi tu
E adesso che sei, dovunque sei, chissà se ti arriva il mio pensiero
Chissà se ne ridi o se ti fa piacere.

E quando uno scrive deve avere un motivo 
Il mio è dirti che la tua avvelenata 
In questi giorni l'ho consumata 

Risulta evidente quanto siam diversi 
Quanto son diversi I tempi del percorso 
Ma sono giorni in cui suona più vicina 
Tutta quella tua incazzatura 

Sarà che anche qui 
Le quattro del mattino 
Sarà che anche qui l'angoscia 
E un po' di vino 
Sarà che non ci posso fare niente

E con quello che guadagni stai muto 
Avanti pure un altro 
Con quello che guadagni sorridi nella foto 

Caro il mio Francesco questa lettera ti arriva 
In un paese piccolo lì sugli Appennini 
Ho capito forse come mai ci vivi 
Che tanto ci si sente soli 

Ci si sente soli per quello che si è visto 
E poi per tutti quelli che han fatto così presto 
A montare su per fare un po' il tuo viaggio 
Giurando che per te davano un braccio 
Parlavano di stile, di impegno e di valori 
Ma non appena hai smesso di essere utile per loro 
Eran già lontani, 
La lingua avvicinata a un altro culo 

E allora avanti un altro 
Almeno chiedi scusa del disturbo 
Avanti pure un altro 
Che se sei lì sarà perchè solo un po' più furbo 

Caro il mio Francesco che conosci un po' I colleghi 
E forse non a caso vivi lì sugli Appennini 
Sai quaggiù ce n'è in qualche modo di tre tipi 
Bravi artisti furbacchioni e topi 

Il topo canta solo di quanto lui sia puro 
E poi da via la madre per stare sul giornale 
Ed è talmente puro che ti lancia merda 
Soltanto per un titolo più largo 

E io che il mio disprezzo me lo tengo dentro 
Che il letamaio è colmo già pubblicamente 
Ma quei presunti mi puri 
Mi possono baciare queste chiappe allegramente 

E allora avanti un altro 
Volevi la tua bici pedalare 
Avanti pure un altro 
Rispondere agli insulti è solo bassa promozione 

Caro il mio Francesco abbiamo tanti privilegi 
Ma tra questi certo non rientrano gli sfregi 
Di chi vuole parlare andando solo a braccio 
Di cose di cui non capisce un cazzo 

Non so com'era allora 
So un poco come adesso 
O sei il numero uno o sei il più grande cesso 
E il tempo che ti danno è fino al ritornello 
E tante volte neanche fino a quello 

Non c'è peggiore sordo di chi non vuol sentire 
Tu pensa a chi non sente e poi ne vuol parlare 
Ma caro il mio Francesco è già mattina 
Qui mi devo svegliare 

E allora avanti un altro 
Ti passo il mio telefono salutami la tipa 
Avanti pure un altro 
Convincila che sono il suo ragazzo per la vita 

Caro il mio Francesco è il momento dei saluti 
Ci avremmo riso sopra se ne avessimo parlato 
Lo so che non ha senso starsi a lamentare 
Di alcune conseguenze del mestiere 

E so che mi son fatto prendere la mano 
Perché uno sfogo fa sbagliare spesso la misura 
Ma come ti dicevo son le quattro del mattino 
L'angoscia e un po' di vino 

E allora vado avanti a cantare della vita 
Sempre e solamente per come io la vedo 
Che la morte se la suona e se la canta 
Chi non sa soffrire da solo 

E allora avanti un altro 
Qualcuno che abbia voglia di ascoltare 
Avanti pure un altro 
Qualcuno che abbia voglia di ballare 
E allora avanti un altro 
Qualcuno che abbia il tempo di ascoltare 
Avanti pure un altro 
Qualcuno che abbia il tempo di ballare",Caro Il Mio Francesco

Con una piccola valigia di cartone
Che hai cominciato a riempire

Due foglie di quella radura che non c'era già più
Rossetti finti ed un astuccio di gemme
E la valigia ha cominciato a pesare
Dovevi ancora partire

E gli occhi han preso il colore del cielo
A furia di guardarlo
E con quegli occhi ciò che vedevi
Nessuno può saperlo

E sole pioggia neve tempesta
Sulla valigia e nella tua testa
E gambe per andare
E bocca per baciare

Hai fatto tutta quella strada per arrivare fin qui
E ad ogni sosta c'era sempre qualcuno
E quasi sempre tu hai provato a parlare
Ma non sentiva nessuno

E ti sei data ti sei presa qualche cosa chissà
Ma le parole che ti sono avanzate
Sono finite tutte nella valigia
E li ci sono restate

E le tue gambe andavano sempre
Sono sempre più adagio
E le tue braccia reggevano a stento
Il peso della valigia

E sole pioggia neve tempesta
Sulla valigia e nella tua testa
E gambe per andare
E bocca per baciare

Sole pioggia neve tempesta
Sui tuoi capelli su quello che hai visto
E braccia per tenere e fianchi per ballare

Hai fatto tutta quella strada per arrivare fin qui
Ma adesso forse ti puoi riposare
Un bagno caldo e qualcosa di fresco
Da bere e da mangiare

Ti apro io la valigia mentre tu resti li
E piano piano ti faccio vedere

Un po' più dure a morire

Ligabue,"Son stati giorni che han lasciato il segno
E stare al mondo è già di più un impegno
E adesso giri con in tasca un pugno
Nell’altra tasca il tuo rimario

L’impatto con il mondo è sempre forte
Per chi vorrebbe solo farne parte
E avere almeno due o tre cose certe
E avere un dio che si diverte

Ma scegli tu fra botte e rime
E scegli tu fra inizio e fine
E scegli tu
Ma scegli tu per primo

E quando canterai la tua canzone
La canterai con tutto il tuo volume
Lasciando qualcun altro a commentare
Che tu devi andare

Son stati giorni di tempesta e vento
Ed era pronto solo chi era pronto
Ma adesso sai a cosa vai incontro
Chi non è morto è già più forte

L’impatto con il mondo è sempre duro
Per chi lo vede come un posto scuro
Vorrei poterti essere utile davvero
Poterti dire che sei al sicuro

Ma scegli tu fra botte e rime
E scegli tu fra inizio e fine
E scegli tu
Ma scegli tu per primo

E quando canterai la tua canzone
E te ne fregherai di quanto piove
La urlerai in faccia a chi non vuole
E non sa sentire

E quando canterai la tua canzone
La rabbia l’innocenza e l’illusione
Ti toccherà cantare l’emozione
Che non sa nessuno

E quando canterai la tua canzone
Da quel momento in poi non puoi tornare
Da quel momento in poi dovrai andare
Con le tue parole

E quando canterai la tua canzone
La canterai con tutto il tuo volume

Senza posti in cui andare

Abbiamo parcheggiato fuori mano
Si sente una canzone da lontano
Nel mezzo del cammini di nostra vita
Mi ritrovai a non aver capito
Ma poi ci fu una distrazione
O forse fu un’insolazione
A dirmi non c’è niente da capire

Averne presa una
Per tutti quegli incroci
Nessuna indicazione
Di tutte quelle strade
Trovarsi a farne una

Un giorno c’ hanno attaccati al seno
Un giorno c’ hanno rovesciato il vino

This is going out to all the homies on a Sunday afternoon

Sittin in the park on a Sunday afternoon
Me and the crew just jammin the oldy tune
Sippin on a cold bottle of brewsky
Gave O? a swig he passed it back to me
Right about then up came some of the homies
Mike, Elia P, J Smooth, Phil and Larry
Bustin out the ice chest Phil popped the cooler
Elia P drunk brew nothing better to do
Mike his cup yo is filled with bird
J Smooth had a cold glass to you know it word
Girls at the place just preparing the food
The sky was clear and the weather was cool
Kids at the playground playing on the merry go round
All the cars cruisin bumpin their funky sound
Cause it?s Sunday last day for a funday
Back to business as usual come Monday
At the park everything went real smooth...
On a Sunday afternoon

(Chorus)
We were chillin at the park
Just waiting for the sun to go down
It was me Shylo and the homies
A Lighter Shade of Brown(on a Sunday afternoon)

I said chill(chill)
All the vatos in the park stay ill(ill)
Playing horseshoes to win the bill(bill)
Carnisata nappin on the grill(grill)
So now we eat
The cops cruise by looking for the boos
But what Ruben had was plainly simply apple juice
Coming up short just like a fool
Went back to his car with nothing he could do
All the cars in the parking lot low profiling
And everywhere you look you see somebody styling
Cars would listen rolling deep with booming sounds
Its a good time to cruise around
In the parking lot where the brownie was stackin
And all the vatos are looking for some action yeah

(Chorus)

Well the sun was set and it began to get dark
And we were gettin ready to leave the park
We had a good time(ahh yeah)
Yeah we had a good day
Pack the stuff off and we was on our way
Yo mackin the brownies as we all cut em off at the pass
But the all actin soft as we pulled up
They was actin all shy to us
But essays yo want to know who's the flyest
We bowed out and Jimmy Hassler passed out
Una sta feo so hey yo pimps jacked out
Coming up short they gave us no run
So yo homies consider this a dry one
Time to cruise the boulevard
Time to have I'm guaranteed to find a brownie while the night is young
We were rolling yeah looking real smooth
Cause cruising Whittier is how we ended our afternoon

Smooth chillin just kickin it
With the top down, down to the ground
I know they be watching me smooth chilliin
Just kickin it with the top down, down to the ground
I pump it up for you...smooth

I was once out strolling one very hot summer's day
When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest
in a big field of tall grass
I lay there in the sun and felt it caressing my face

And I fell asleep and dreamed
I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie
And that I was the star of the movie
This really blew my mind, the fact that me,
an overfed, long-haired leaping gnome
should be the star of a Hollywood movie

But there I was, I was taken to a place, the hall of the mountain kings
I stood high upon a mountain top, naked to the world
In front of every kind of girl, there was
black ones, round ones, big ones, crazy ones...

Out of the middle came a lady
She whispered in my ear something crazy
She said:

Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl
Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl

[Spoken]
I thought to myself what could that mean
Am I going crazy or is this just a dream
Now, wait a minute
I know I'm lying in a field of grass somewhere
so it's all in my head
and then.. I heard her say one more time:

[Sung]
Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl
Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl

[Spoken]
I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back
As she disappeared, but soon she returned
In her hand was a bottle of wine, in the other, a glass
She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass
And raised it to her lips
And just before she drank it, she said:

Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl

Lighter Shade of Brown,"You might ask is why we call ourselves the hip hop locos
Baking like Boston beans fartin out our vocals
No laxative for the shit that we get
So pass it on to Mike you Mikey he likes it
Others disapprove of the move that we swing
Not a brown underground thing not a pop thing
Yo you gotta come hard hey yo we in their face
I switch pop to hip hop to pop both ways
Versatile some should learn the definition
If money is the key then sucka why you dissin
The rap scene is hectic when it ends from when it starts
But most rap groups today are found on the pop charts
don't get us wrong we prefer the funk better
But a job is a job for the real go getter
Standing in the spotlight here come the bros
Throwing down with the brown on the hip hop locos

Chorus 2x
Hippity hop what?
The hippity hop locos
Hippity hop what?

Once again its on never the same old song
cause me and my boy you know that we got it going on
Listen to while I flow
Got the skills to let em know
So let me be the one that was the one
Who told you so check it
Most didn't think we could flow rhymes
Excite write produce the whole 9
I don't want to respect cause I get mine
You got static raise up cause its fight time
I'm the beginning to end you gets no win
I put my fist to your chin you working
Pound for pound I hold my own when I come around
So ain't nothin but a come up when I'm throwin down
Like this like that spit game when I rap
Got back to bum rush and filled your cap
So everybody gather round and peep the vocal
Its the D also known as the hip hop locos

Chorus 3.5X

Versatile some should learn the definition 3x
I switch pop to hip hop to pop both ways
Versatile some should learn the definition 3x
I switch pop to hip hop to pop both ways

Now the brothers help me out on the side with my rap skills
Did what I had to do now its time to show you the deal
Never rap on the mic intoxicated
I might of hit the drink but the crew you know I can't fade it
19 years old and I never in the twelfth
For me being a loco I had to go myself
>From Santa Ana the city that gave me my pride
I kicked it and I chilled with the homies on the Westside
Born and raised a baby Latin with my little Latin friends
Thinking of ways so that we could make ends
Always stuck to hip hop cause hip hop won't flop
So let us swing our thing and let it rain like a rain drop
Snap back go pop cause the shop has been rocked
With a style that they call a hipper shade of hip hop
Goes out to those both friends and foes
As we close
Ugh..The hip hop locos

Lighter Shade of Brown,"Verse: 1 ( ODM )
Well you ask me what the definition of a homie is
A friend till the end, but some start when you're kids
Little traviesos that are always into something
Doing something bad acting like they did nothing
Well here's a little story about a homie named frankie
Had another little homie that was down for hanky panky
Sort of like Spanky and Alfalfa, Little Rascals
Doing what they doing getting away without a hassle
Like going to the schoolyard for your late passes to class

Cutting in lunch lines leaving other students last
And strolling to the movies to see a rated ""are""
When mom's dropped them off it's where E.T. would be the star

Stealing was an issue that just could not be ignored
Taking tapes and 45's from the local record store
Being good kids to them was nothing but bologna
Cause this is what you do when it's you and your homies

Chorus

Verse: 2 ( DTTX )

My situation with my homies wasn't all fun
sometimes bad sometimes sad, but had to have one
I wouldn't change it for a thing cause it's priceless
Your homies are your down, yup!  Can I get a righteous
As kids, we saw and we did what most kids never did
Took my first swig chilling at my homies crib
Searching for ways, so that we could make presidents
Life was hard beign a product of my residence
But me beign the youngest, I had to stay strong
Mom's was my teacher cause Pop's was already gone
Hung out in the streets doing my own thing
Living in the barrio, but I never gangbanged
Coming up was a must, growing up with who I grew up
I found out just who I can trust
Me, Myself, and I not fronting like a phony
I'm true to the game and I'm down with my homies

Chorus

Verse: 3 ( ODM,DTTX )

You want to be my homie well hey I'll tell you something
Hanging with my crew doesn't really mean nothing
Blabbing when I get all toured doing my songs
You gonna want to kick it, well listen up here holmes
It goes way back before you ever knew me
I hung with my friends and not male groupies
Just goes to show everybody where I'm coming from
Hey yo! D' break em off something

( DTTX )
So many people want to hang now that I'm in the rap game
They say that they're down when they don't even know my name
Well I could say that I have many friends
But a homie is true, through and through until the end
And ain't a damn thing changed
We're still hanging in the hood and doing the same thangs
Cause I ain't one to be a phony
I'm still true to the game and I'm down with my homies

Rollin down the street
Make fat lounge in my seat

Livin it like any day
That's the way it's got to be

And you know it just don't stop

It's just another sunny day and we looking to parlay
And you know it just don't stop

(Verse 1)
It's goin down
Rollin round town through the streets
Bustin a left turn at the park where the homies meet
In the sunshine
Another sunny day where the girls wear mini-skirts 
And low rider six trays
Money makers... 
And locced out OG's in the Rigo smoking out bumpin oldies 
In the deck with mo bounce to the ounce
And don't pass me no stress cause you what I m about
Makin money and spendin the grip
You see my shit payed for 
So homeboy don't trip
I got it locked down
In the California state 
From city to city, worldwide 
I make em shake
Steppin out the ride in my Pelle gear
Girls yellin out the window
Oh yeah Shylo come here
You know you can't knock the hustle   
It's the way that we play
It's just another sunny day in Califon-I-A
 
[Chorus]
 
(Verse 2)
You know it's just another day in the city
Ridin around, checkin out what's goin down
And the summer shinin
And every way in southern California
Where the weather is hot
And everybody on the block
Got the weekends here 
You know we bumpin it, celebratin 
Money makin and ain't nobody playa hatin 
As I roll with the homies and we cruise up the blocks
The 17's spinnin letting down the top
From the east to the west want to see just how ride
want to see how we kick it getting down all night 
Crack bottles of Cris and Hennessey for them keys
Rollin up in the Lex
And the Locos own D s
Hittin the switches
And everybody getting down
Givin the heat knowin there's a party goin round
Got me lovin it 
Everyday like constantly
It's just another sunny day in see-A-L for me
 
[Chorus]
 
(Verse 3)
We in the golden state 
Feelin great when you see me side
There's not a cloud in the sky when you see me ride
And we be all up in the mix
In the six 
And everybody want to party when we rollin with the click
Slow down and hit the dip chrome 
Shinin on the kit
Candy on the flame it's the ultimate 
And we goin roll down a one way
Think it was a Sunday
Nothin like another sunny day all over Cali
 
(Verse 4)
Feelin the breeze
Bumpin my CD s
Lookin at the temp it's a 100 degrees
When we ride we hittin corners in the navigators 
When we slide we looking out for them player-haters
Bright lights and big city feelin fitty
Havin fun in the sun wit loved ones 
It's alright... OC's to IE's where I was sidin 
SC's to Southern Cali's where I live by

Let that ol' midnight special
Ease my troubled mind

Is a mighty lonesome place

Shovellin' mud directly in your face

Well, goodbye, baby, may God bless you
And may He bless ol' Killer a little bit too

Lightnin' Hopkins,"Once in the country there was a little boy; every morning that he
would go to the table with his little two sisters and brothers, you know,
he would go there, he couldn't talk but his mother didn't know what
was wrong with him so... she would go to the table in the morning, she
would fix for breakfast, she'd fix toast and coffee, enough, coffee for
the tin, toast for the eggs for the church, then she would ask and say,
what you want this morning? Oh mama, toast and milk, you know
things like that you know. But the little old boy he couldn't talk good,
so she asked him say what you want son? Said sa-sa-a I want-t
t-t-t- She said Hush. Say I tell you what to do. You just hush, I just
go bring you what I bring the rest of 'em, cause one of these days I'm
gonna learn you how to talk.
She goin' back and she fixes, the next morning same thing. So what
would you children want this morning? Butter 'n toast mama. Get
around to the little old boy, say What you want? He say, bu-bu-bu-
bu-bu-bu... she say Lord, have mercy, that's what mama said and
she walked away, say wonder what's wrong with my child?
He heard her. But you know the little boy couldn't do no better. So
after he'd find out that mama couldn't understand him, and he couldn't
understand the way his mama was doin' him, he packed up his little
flower sack, and he decide that he would leave. 
So when he left, on his way, he run up on a old rollin' mill, what they
call Mister Charlie's. So he walked up to mister Charlie, mister Charlie
was workin' round in his rose bushes 'n things... so he taps him: mi-mi-mi... say Mister! But he didn't know his name that time. The man
straightened up and said my name is mister Charlie. He say
mi-mi-ch-ch-ch-ch- He said but boy I ain't got to fool with you, you
can't work. He said, me-me can work!
So the man went on workin' and he'd tap him again. He said me-me-me
wanna home. He said look, boy, I've got a old bunk house out in
the back, said and if you promise me that you will stay in this bunk
house, and watch my mill, and keep the fire from burning my mill
down, say I live two blocks up the road, say and if you see the
mill's on fire, say you run up and tell me the mill's on fire, you got a
home and meal as long as I've got it. Ta-ta-ta-ta-thank you mister
Charlie. So the little old boy went to bunkin' that night.
Sho' enough, late one Sunday morning, mister Charlie's mill caught on
fire. Which he'd forgot about what he had told the little boy. The little
boy run up to him, he was cleaning out his front yard, makin' it
beautiful with them rose bushes, you know with them red rose bushes
you know how to keep 'em red those rose bushes, and the little boy
run up there, tapped him on his back, and he raised up and said
Hey son, why here's you again.
Ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye and he was pointing back toward the mill, tryin'
to tell him his rollin' mill was on fire. So mister Charlie said, I ain't got
time to fool with you. So the little boy stuttered too bad for him to
understand. So mister Charlie stooped over him again, he pat him on
the back, said ye-ye-ye-ye-your ro-ro- he said Wait a minute. He
said, if you can't talk you must sing, and he hollered:
(sings)
Whooooooooa mister Charlie
Do you know your rolling mill is burnin' down?

Can you see the tears roll down the street.
I've been looking for my baby
And I've been wondering where can she be

I my baby early one morning
She was walking on down the street
I my baby early one morning
She was walking on down the street
You know it hurt me, hurt me so bad
It made my poor heart skip a beat

I got a real, real fine feeling
That my baby she don't love me no more

That my baby she don't love me no more

Oh, I've got a girl with a record machine
When it comes to rockin' she's a queen
Love to dance on a Saturday night
All alone, I can hold her tight
But she lives on a twentieth floor up town
The elevator's broken down

So I climbed one, two flight, three flight, four
Five, six, seven flight, about eight flight more
On the twelfth I started to drag
By the fifteenth floor I'm ready to sag
Get to the top, But I'm too tired to rock

She called me up on the telephone
She said c'mon over, Cause I'm all alone
I said baby, you're mighty sweet
But I'm in the bed with a-achin' feet
This went on for a couple of days

Don't talk about it, don't let it get you down
It's only one part, of the story
Just let it go, don't let it bring you down now.

The last word on your breath
I'll be the one to keep you, keep you at your best
The last thing on your mind
'Cause I don't need your mess
I'll be the one to keep you one disaster less

Straighten up your tie, take the microphone
Forget about it, don't let it get you down
Now is not the time, and you're not alone
Shut up about it, no one can bring you down now

The last word on your breath
I'll be the one to keep you, keep you at your best
The last thing on your mind
'Cause I don't need your mess
I'll be the one to keep you one disaster less

We got that green stuff, Big Tite
Lil Flip the Leprechaun, Slim Thug the Boss Hogg
Fin to put it all in y'all face

[Slim Thug]
I got too much money, too much cash
I bought a new Lac and put it on chrome, without touching my stash
Like Lil Flip I can do that, Excursion candy blue that
22 that, pounds of dro I done blew that
You should of knew that, the Slim Thug gon shine
My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line, you can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys
Talking noise, cause I ain't old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank
I'm top rank, Slim Thug gon talk the talk
Walk the walk, we can bet ball for ball
We some paid young G's, with too much cash
Too much flow and do', talking too much trash ha

[Hook - 2x]
Too much money, too much cash
All y'all haters, can kiss our ass
We got too much money, too much cash
All y'all haters, can kiss our ass

[Lil Flip]
Too much money is what I got, like Scarface I rap a lot
S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging 4's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, cause nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be, I know your gal know me
Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And y'all haters, y'all can kiss our ass

[Hook - 2x]

[Tite]
I got too much M-O-N-E-why
Anything I S-E-E, I be-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car
We got too much green, and that's real by far

",Freestyle
Lil C,"The streets lights are glowing, everyday's another struggle
The moon is slowly and silent staring make it so my hustle is antite
The city streets is hectic gotta get it
Here the mall, ain't a promise to me
So I don't live and feel working til' I touch it, stack it until I need it
I spend it on what I want, reup and that's when I need
It's over you never see me, it's being salt as it's lesser
The niggas straight out the gutta, murder without a question
Bodies in my surroundings, clickclack from downing
All they know is he missing when niggas ain't never found him
Assaulting is the least, I don't live it on rejects
I'm a muthafuckin' killer foreal with the same threat
I'm as gangsta as it gets and my advice for you is lay your life
Ya never know when niggas might hit you in the city lights
Get it right, ya never know when niggas might hit you in the city lights
Get it right (get it right)

Born and raised on the north blocks, home of the hard knocks
Wanna get rich, find a spot to pump that hard out
Might get robbed and shot if niggas don't think you worthy
In my hood, I saw a lot of gangstas die early
Mama heart broke, and brother feel like he gotta fix it
So he loading up from straps, bout to hit it where they kick it
Got a first class ticket to the pen
Seventeen years old but up in that they all men
It's just another day, one come out, another go in
It's hard out here, you can't even trust yo friends
They'll have a nigga set up, whatever by the curb
It's every man for self, oh you ain't heard
I'm a muthafuckin' hog, survive through it all
Stand up tall, we don't fall, naw
I been shot at but ain't been shot
Been in plenty fight but ain't been drop
Always came out on top like a hardknock

Straight up
Yeah, these tattoo tears cover my face
My momma got mad at first but shit she know she may
I'm a g you gotta pray for me, it is what it is
Why these niggas out here playing, mayne this really my fear?
What'cha know about them late nights, no lights and no food?
No diapers for the baby's, the house smell like booboo
Think of what'chu would do what I tell ya what I does
Walk straight up off the porch, now the camus begun
My big brother on lock, so I starve his gut
He goin' lead to where he at, I been in the going stuff for crack and that
Big homie knew I had it on my mind
He ain't like it but it right that run it through my bloodline
He knew what he decline and what goin' be hard for me to find
So he choose to put me down, and I got up on my grind
The dawg and you hoes say I'm glorifying crack
My momma lights off, the whole house pitch black, bitch!

Roll Cadillac we don't fuck with no Lexus
Bitch by my side in my ride lookin' lovely
Pour up out the paint we ain't sippin' on no bubbly
Screwed tape loud while I'm swangin' by the crowd
And the dro'' got me how it feel like I'm in a cloud

Grindin' hard, paper stackin' tryna follow the plan
Pullin', gloss and steams chasin' million dollar dreams
Livin' the thug life I get it by any means
When times get hard I got no one to hold me down
So I ride with the top down and cruise around town
The boppers in line, cause I been known to be a slab rider
Comin' down clean, marchin' like a freedom fighter
When you ride 4's patna' stay strapped
The gone catch ya at the light and put one in ya cap
See I keep it in my lap, I ain't slippin' for none
I ain't got sprayed by any but homie I ain't done
I'm bout to raise a truck and drop a couple of screens
I'm thinkin' ? with bout 4-15's
See the leather is perforated, them boys gone sho' hate it
My slab is undisputed I'm the number one rated
With my Top Drop

While they waitin' on me to fall, I'm a still stand tall
Ball hard in the mall
I been shinin' for a while, haters ya in denial
Since back in 9 -8 I been wreckin' freestyles
With spit lines that'll put a smile on ya child
And do a song that'll make the hood go wild
The flow versatile, When they hear it they like wow
That boy got talent yeah I like your style.
But uh
No pressure, don't let the bullshit stress ya
A ? with somebody test ya
God bless ya
Ya Grind lesser, ya shine lesser
Ya win when you don't let this material shit impress ya
Insides like a dresser, wood grain on the dash
My motto, fuck pain put my name on the cash
I used to wish and dream I could swang on the glass
Now cars, clothes, and hoes is a thang of the past

Welcome to the South
Try to criticize us for how we live
They gon do the same things that we just did
Betta watch your mouth
Try to criticize us for how we spit
Then say you respect the money that we get
Welcome to the south
Watch em criticize everything we did
And expect that us to never even trip
We know them grills and candy paint
So be careful what you say
Cuz we might just throw it right back in your face
Betta watch your mouth

[Verse 1]
[Chamillionaire]

Uh I cross the globe
I hit a hater
Same whispers from state to state
If you didn't say then this ain't for you
Don't worry bout it cuz you can't relate
Before you buy me then you criticize me
While you beside me
Lets get it straight
Cuz you remind me of the kid beside me
Same rapper that you say you hate
Wanna criticize then fine
Say the south got simple rhymes
Everytime I travel I'm in the backyard that act just like mine
Same rhyme just different times
I don't think that it changed a lil
Used to show our grills and they be like ew
Nowadays they all say thats ill
I remember when the major label
Wouldn't even come pay a visit
Used to say they had love for us but
They just blowin them suspect kisses
Now you watchin me see you plottin me
Can't act like we ain't suspicious
Shoot the slugs you shoot at us but when you bust your thang it misses, uh
I ain't leavin much trippin
Cuz im a man where I'm residing
Im decidin where I'm residing
Should never tolerate domestic violence
I know you'd rather me just relax and sit back in silence
But I'm the owner not just the client
Shit the south is where I stay at

Then turn around and be a swagger jacker

But we wasn't trippin cuz it had to happen
Styrophone cup and a snapla, you actin like you been a fan of rappers
You was hatin or participatin when you saw sub anuba slidin through
You and everybody else that did it, they applauded them and they applauded you
You actin like somebody made ya say it
Took your hand and then applied the glue
Turn around and give the mic to you
And now you end up lookin like a fool
Can't holla ya, some followers
and thats the reason I'm in the lead
The rest of yall are some benchwarmers and gettin mad cuz I'm in the lead
I'm switchin speeds, don't get fatigued
Yall behind in line, yall chasin me
Yall finna see my energy, so get off my back and let a playa breathe
I won't lie and act like I'm the one supportin everything
Like southern rappers ain't never lame
Like some of these boys don't eff up the game
Most of us do our thang
And the rest of em leave my ears in pain
But thats him and he sure ain't me
So don't look at us like we all the same

I was workin the wood, circle smokin candy mashin on the gas
I can't be you, I can't do you
I just do me, if you ain't
Been where I been then you can't
Be who I be if you ain't
Seen what I see and you can't see what I see
I put the bricks in the rolla with slabs on that wasn't free
Been a legend in the south since the year '93
Pocket full of stones, menace to society
The heart in the car chrome and folds, not B's
Now everybody pimpin and they all got keys
Nigga please, you work for UPS
They say they smokin dro but all I keep smellin is stress

Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me

March 11, 1981
My momma gave birth to a hell raising heavenly son
And my daddy was a fool addicted to brown
So he wasn't ever around, but my momma held me down

When me and big sister had nothing to eat
My momma gave up her last trying to make ends meet
She was a school teacher, working to provide for her fam'
Struggling in AA, to submit to gods plan

Them long twelve's steps of hardway are all on your own
No family, few friends, my momma was all alone
She did it for her children, struggling to make a living
And some how we still had food on thanksgiving

When I can barely talk momma taught me to pray
And right then I knew that we'd have a better life some day
She still give up her last just to see me smile
That's the definition of love for you child, I love my momma

[Chorus]

My momma was my role model, I had no father figure
Just a bunch of pipe dreams of being richer
But as times got tougher my life just got rougher
It hurts so bad to see me watch my momma suffer

Its so hard to cope when you so dead broke
So momma used to make me memorize the song quotes
In the middle of a session momma gave god praise
I knew what it meant to struggle at such an early age

Remember them days she barely earned minimum wage
But made sure I had new cloths to start the seventh grade
She met my step father, and walked down the aisle
I praised he sent somebody that would make my momma smile

He raised me as his own, he taught me to be a man
Adopted me and Anne, and gave momma a hand
I just love to see that beautiful smile on momma face
My momma could never be replaced, I love my momma

[Chorus]

20 years of struggling, done came to a close
No more old, torn up, and hand me down cloths
She deserve the best, and never nothing less
No stress, give my momma that Gucci dress

The times were hard but we done made it out the rain
The storm was severe but we overcame the hurricane
Them rainy days seem to last so long
When them times got hard my momma told me be strong

My number 1 supporter ever since day one
And still till this day momma would die for her son
No more slumz, all them rainy days are done
No a days we taking trips to Disney world just for fun

I put you in a Benz take you out that nova
Its been a long rough road, but that bumpy rides over
You raise me from a baby, my number 1 lady
And until the day I'm in my grave, ima stay mommas baby

Refuse to talk about just, cars and bling-bling

Big hundred carrot badge, I'm the captain of the streets
Roll deep like police, blue boys got it lock
Ya see me on patrol in ya hood on yo block
Holla

[Chorus: x2]

When I hit the club all the girls show me love (show me love)
Cause worldwide they be fuckin' with Thug
Because the boss got class, the boss stay G'ed
I'm everywhere you ain't never there, where you be?
I got a crib in Miami, house side in Cali
Spot in A-T-L, but I be out there Bally
Cause I live in the H, and got hoes round the globe
Stacking up you want, I'm getting doe by the low
That's how I stay froze and fresh with the clothes
My closet got mo kicks than they got in the sto's
I pop tags, shirt match my badge
Eyelids low, looking at the Prada glass",Show Me Love
Lil C,"[Chorus]
Hard times, look over your peoples cause everybody dying
Osama Bin Loden is dropping bombs man, in a situation like this
How can I reach calm man, calm man, my nigga
This is hard times, like its so much gun smoke and see the stars
Shine
We living on dreams but is they coming true, what I'm gonna do
Make a million and pull a stunt or two, a stunt or two

Step into the world of a mob nigga, live in so much pain
The rain steady pumping me up, locked down on hard times
But I'm knowing that I gotta make it, running on my deadline
Giving out flat lines, cause if you think that I'm feeling
Fucking up by mine man, I gotta maintain
Its like everything that I had, it won't ever be the same
I feel I'm sicking home the cemetery
'Cause that's where all of my people rest
I can't take the stress, I'm fin to send it through somebody chest
That's why I walk around pissed off, strapped with a vest
I done been through a lot, ready to release the glock
Vicinities South, a brother on my Dickie, I be ready to ride
And I'm sick of this shit, I ain't fin to be hiding out, lately
Street life's got a nigga lost, will I wind up in a coffin
I don't know, I'm about to blow, I don't wanna take no mo'
But when I bust in a rush, you better hit the flow
Reality is a motherf**ker, that's what they was telling a nigga
That's just the truth, I lost my nigga Screw 
And Relay too and Andrew, now what about Danny Boo
That's fucked up, growing up in a childhood all alone with nobody
No mama no daddy, Z-Ro I see why these niggas can't relate to us
'Cause we them thugs of another kind
Making these niggas feel us two rhymes
'Cause if they lived the life that we live
They'd probably be broke down, crying and dying

[Chorus]

Living in the ghetto, everyday is a motherfucking test
And I just can't rest, gotta keep a vest around my chest
Seem like everybody wanna start a little plex
Nigga but not me though, I'm trying to focus 
On bigger and brighter thangs
Steady trying to come out the storm
From hurricanes, to heaven and lighter rain
Running away from the police

Nigga fuck peace, its all about war
Nothing but a A-K and a H-K and a Tommy Gun
Sitting in the back of the car, I just can't cope
Everybody is a suspect, even if you don't bust I'ma bust back
We down to ride and, all you little 
Bitches and niggas get off my nut sack
Been eighteen lonely years, since I buried my T Dogs
When I be shooting the breeze
But I'm still conversating like she ain't gone
You can take a look at this light of mine
Never did glimmer, never did shine
'Cause I resort to a life of crime
And I know I'm wrong, but I gotta get mine
Fools don't understand me, a nigga be nervous 24/7
Puffing on sticky, eyes redder than period candy
Look at my pockets, I might as well stop it
Because them hoes on flat, look in the freezer
And a sive, ain't nothing but a stomach, these are hard times

[Chorus]

Ro pass me the AK, one of these niggas
Fin to pay for everything that I'm feeling, ain't no more healing
To the head with lead, is the only thing I'ma be drilling
My nigga this hard times, and the way that it look
I don't think that it's gonna get better, the only thing that's here
Is to suck it up, inside I know that's why we not giving a fuck
Ready to bust, on anything this life feeling, like we on our last breath
I'm quiet as kept, my nigga don't start 
Or else somebody gon see they death
Or hate us like that, but this side of Trae it be like that all times
The only thing that I know more than pain, is pain and me never dying

Poverty stricken and headed to prison
Running because of the life, you looking for codeine
Or amphetamines, I got em at the cheapest price
Living by the rules of the street life, fin to get niggas
Better beat the street light home, after dark I par-park
Everybody be tripping, attempting to get rich
Dig a bigger ditch bitch bleed, I'm a motherfucking man
Trying to do all that I can, I always held my ground
And I never ran, got shot for taking a stand 
I need a plexing, because I'm stressing, losing my mind
Smoking Wesson, my head I'm pressing, hard times

Now I gots mo' mayo than the rest of the pushers
Rat a tat tat tat came my Tec from the bushes
I blast with no heart 'cause I'm heartless in nine-trey

Another sad case of a mistaken identity

I sat and watched them shoot my homey
Seen his face crack

A dropped bomb full of 187 soldiers
Doin' dirt 'cause we dirty when the trigga pull
Seventeen in his body left the boy full
Of hollow tips so I know he won't be comin' back

Lil Cuete,"(Chorus)
I overcame rainy days in my life, 
Didn?t need you girl anyway,ill be fine, 
Just as long the sun keep shining my way,
Ima be alright, ima be okay

Verse 1
You tell me you love me and you can?t get enough 
But then you call me and you tell me that were breaking up
Look what you do to me
Seems like you?re out to ruin me
And every time you lie, you make a fool of me
Change your ways girl, you?ll probably lose me
It?s not a game girl, cause you'll be losing 
A good thing and you don?t have to explain 
But you have to take responsibility for the pain, you gave me
I thought you?ll always be my lady
You told me to hold on, and like a fool I keep on waiting
It?s alright though, I'll find someone new
And if that?s the way you want it, then the choice is on you
But just remember that I didn?t need you around
I kept you cause I love you not for you to put me down, I bet you see now
How a man can grow strong and if loving you was wrong 
Then I got to move on.

(Chorus)
I overcame rainy days in my life, 
Didn?t need you girl anyway,ill be fine, 
Just as long the sun keep shining my way,
Ima be alright, ima be okay

Verse 2
I guess it wasn?t really meant to be 
But I?m glad it happened now cause it would happen eventually
It?s sad to see it didn?t end how I wanted
It?s sad to see I wasn?t the one you wanted
I guess I got to start over and try
Start with someone new, like a girl that won?t lie and break my heart like you did
It?s a shame, nobody ever made me feel the way that you did
I?m caught up in the middle of a feeling that I don't want to get rid off
But you take yourself away from me
And I can?t understand cause you?re still unhappy
Even though I tried my best to make you happy
You say I don?t deserve you, you don?t deserve me
You?re the type of girl that would do something just to hurt me
And yeah I guess it?s true I don?t know much about you
But I do know one thing that I?ll do better without you

(Chorus)
I overcame rainy days in my life, 
Didn?t need you girl anyway,ill be fine, 
Just as long the sun keep shining my way,
Ima be alright, ima be okay

Verse 3
You see I learned my lesson and the outcome was true
Even though you love someone, doesn?t mean they love you
So before you give yourself to someone else 
Make sure they love you and nobody else
And this I tell you so you don?t get hurt
A lot of men do know what a women is worth 
He would give up all his covers and sleep out in the rain
He would help her through her problems and take away your pain
I know
Cause that?s the type of man I am, 
I?m the type of man that would take a lady by your hand
And show her, that I wanna get to know her
Tell her that she?s beautiful and that I wanna hold her
Eventually, it all be that way and I?ll walk up to her and ask her her name
My name is Cuete 
It?s nice to meet you
I was wondering if one day I could kick it with you

(Chorus)
I overcame rainy days in my life, 
Didn?t need you girl anyway,ill be fine, 
Just as long the sun keep shining my way,
Ima be alright, ima be okay",Rainy Days
Lil Cuete,"Hey girl don't you know
Money buys almost anything
But it can't buy real love.

I see you everyday but you never look at me
You're always looking good but you look unhappy
Tell me why you choose to live like this
If you were mine I'd never make you feel like this
You need a man not someone that's gonna hurt you
You need to let him go he doesn't deserve you
And when I say I'll make you happy it's true
Or you could stay with your man
And get your heart broken too
But here's my number call me up if you want
And when you feel lonely you could roll through my spot
See I ain't trippin' homies lost in my game
Nobody know's it til we say 'cause I'm ahead of the game
'Cause I'm a king what I need is a queen I could have a million dollars but it won't mean a thing
Now I ain't rich but I'll tell you one thing
I could give you more happiness then money can bring

Now I don't drive a fancy car,
No diamond in my pinkie ring
Barely make enough to get me by
Nothing left for material things
But hey girl don't you know money buys almost anything
But it can't buy real love

I want to be you're only one
And you could be mine too
'Cause baby I'm going crazy
When I think about you
I get excited when I see you come through
Nobody else made me feel the way that you do
I need a woman not a girl
Not just someone to fuck
I don't mean no disrespect
But that's wassup
I see you smile when I talk like that
It seems like it's been a while since you smiled like that
But maybe we can kick it
You spend a little time
Sit down one-on-one
And let you know what's on my mind
I know a good thing when I see it
And I see it in you
So tell me what I gotta do to make you feel the same too
Because I'm a king what I need is a queen
I could have a million dollars
But it won't mean a thing
Now I ain't rich
But I can tell you one thing
I can give you more happiness
Then money can bring
And that's real

Now I don't drive a fancy car,
No diamond in my pinkie ring
Barely make enough to get me by
Nothing left for material things
But hey girl don't you know money buys almost anything
But it can't buy real love

That's all I've got to give my heart and soul to you
Only way I wanna live sharing each moment with you
Take it fast take it slow girl you know it's real this time (so real)
Don't let true love pass you by baby

Now I don't drive a fancy car,
No diamond in my pinkie ring
Barely make enough to get me by
Nothing left for material things
But hey girl don't you know money buys almost anything
But it can't buy real love

So real",Real Love
Lil Cuete,"Hello
Hi daddy!
What are you doing?

Mm hm
I love you
I love you daddy
Aight I'm a go back to work right now OK?
Ok
I gotta go make that money for us
I love you
Be careful and behave alright.

We do what we gotta do to make it through these hard times
I'm drugling and hustling I'm always on the grind inside
Why can't I get away somebody take me away (to a better place)
Everything will be OK
Why can't I get away somebody take me away (to a better place)
Everything will be OK

I remember when I'm gonna sing this
Fix this barely got money to put food in the kitchen
After working hard trying make ends meets
Best believe to any life next week
Lyrics
But no one gonna hold me down
And this I swear to myself
Nobody gonna get the best of me
Cause I need nobody's help
And that for sure
I hold my own thing and do my own thing
I ain't gonna stop til I'll top and
Drop and resting in peace
I know I gotta stay strong
So I don't breck and my kids say
Daddy gotta make that bank
And if I die before I wake
I pry the lord my sole to take
Cause never will I give 'em
Never will I fell them because

We do what we gotta do to make it through these hard times
I'm drugling and hustling I'm always on the grind inside
Why can't I get away somebody take me away (to a better place)
Everything will be OK
Why can't I get away somebody take me away (to a better place)
Everything will be OK

No matter what I do I never seems to be enough
They try to hold me down
But I get back up
My mind stay tough
When the time get rough
So I gotta take a puff on this purple stuff
I can't sleep I still up in the late night
I'm thinking about my move for the day light
There no left so I get my pay right
One false move they send straight to the cage right
I still live the same up in the street gangs
I spend awhile everyday trying to maintain
I still try to get up on my feet
Still trying to fly away
Still trying to spread my wings
But no matter what I'm never gonna give up
I gotta stay up both water in my head up
Even thou time are rough and you fed up
We gotta do what it take to get up

We do what we gotta do to make it through these hard times
I'm drugling and hustling I'm always on the grind inside
Why can't I get away somebody take me away (to a better place)
Everything will be OK
Why can't I get away somebody take me away (to a better place)
Everything will be OK

Waking up in the morning everyday
With the same thought
Is the pain and the rain ever gonna stop
Will I make it through the day without getting shot
Or will the way of the world get me caught
Up in the mix down were I can't move
Do what I do if someone walks in my shoes
I give it up to cause work nine to five
Keep on doing what you doing to survive your life
But what would you do if your sons was at home
Crying on the floor cause
He left alway alone wishing he could fly away
Every single night cause his dad is in prison and
His mom on the pipe
Will that be enough to get you back on your feet
Or knowing that he ain't got food to eat
We do what we gotta do to make it throug these hard time
I always on the grind I gotta get mine

We do what we gotta do to make it through these hard times
I'm drugling and hustling I'm always on the grind inside
Why can't I get away somebody take me away (to a better place)
Everything will be OK
Why can't I get away somebody take me away (to a better place)
Everything will be OK",Take Me Away

Those margaritas not goin' on my card
I ain't 'bout to split a damn thing for convenience sake
I'm at the restaurant workin' that waitress
You ain't heard of lil Dave, or L the Jew biz major
Fuck you know 'bout the world he was raised in?
I've been saving money since the motherfucker 13

Free sale with just homie, two stamps away

All of my bitches be scared of me, I put that rod in 'em
All of them bitches actin' thotties, I disregard them
All them bitches actin' holy, ain't got no God in 'em
I can teach a lil nigga somethin', preach
I can take his ass church fresh as hell, no Easter
I can make his ass burp like a baby without no hiccup
I can

Quan what's this have to do with saving money though?
You know what, a full verse would have been to expensive anyways
I think

I ain't parkin' that unless the meter green homie
Hair cut several months in-between homie
Hit the motherfuckin' lights when I leave homie
Single ply TP ass bleed
Air B&B the mother fucker, least I'm never there
I'm not in Cali, why the fuck my company in Delaware?
Happy hour takin' out the chicken, I don't even care
That applies to both dating and wings
Peep matinees phone bill got the motherfuckin' fam on it
401k rollin' over bands on it
Coppin' sweaters in the summer, went and sail on 'em

Frequent flying like a motherfuckin' finch tho

Just so I can whet the appetite of dick
What you talkin' about?
My AC never doing nothing, blow fans
Walgreens card shoppin' all the off brands
Boy go hard when collecting, got Venmo
Save every motherfuckin' roach, tryna smoke
Check the clothes in my drawers, I ain't playin' around
It's LD, lil boy, Mr. Hand-me-down
Dirty drawers gettin' worn, can you blame me now?
You think I got $4.50 up in quarters on me well I fucking don't!

If you at a restaurant and got an iced coffee
And the waiter been refillin' that without a word of caution
And you get your fuckin' bill and you can see 'em double chargin'
For the coffee and you told 'em there's a problem
Sing a long like
Ohh don't double charge for me for that
Don't double charge me, we like
Ohh don't double charge for me for that
Don't do it to yourself
'Cause I might just ask what the ice cube's worth
What the ice cube's worth
That's the only differentiate in making this a non free perk
And I might make work more difficult for you than it need be
So think about it, take a minute let it breathe b
But think about it bro, you saw me get the burger with the bacon on the side
After looking at the price of the side, of just bacon and comparing it
To what the difference in a cheeseburger verse the bacon cheeseburger was in making my decision
I would hate to be the waiter, tryin' to tell me something different
Imma get on Yelp in a minute and review this piece of shit place like only a Kike know how
Unless you take the extra coffee off I might get loud
Unless you, oh, it was just an accident?
You didn't even mean that?
I'm so embarrassed",$ave Dat Money
Lil Dicky,"Yeah
Ay, can y'all turn my headphones down? Significantly?
Cool, that's good
It was super loud

First of all, this shit about me
I ain't made this shit for y'all, that's the damn thing
I've been waiting pretty long to get on some shit and rip it for Dicky
So just consider this my damn theme song, baby
I've been working hella hard, though
There's people telling me I'm 'bout to be a star, bro
But when I play 'em some of this, they like nobody want the pissed Lil Dicky
You the funny kid, that's where your car go
That metaphor about my lane, if your retardo
I'm bubbling like I'm in a soda, word to Fargo
I'm tryna get the fucking fame and it's a tricky little game you gotta play
Sometimes you gotta tell your heart ""No""
Here's the problem I've been having
I wanna make my favorite type of music
And the shit I like to bump is not the type I'm brewing
I be on that ""Fuck the world, you motherfuckers losing"" type of shit
Like all you haters, look at what the fuck I'm doing
All my favorite rappers not amusing
And I love my funny stuff, I hope it's not confusing
I'm just saying, when you doing something time consuming
Every now and then you wanna spaz
Why I didn't go with jazz, muhfucka
Get up in yo ass, muhfucka
Y'all are trash, you ain't even know the half
I could rattle off a lot of opposition to rap game
But honestly I'm not in the position for that plane
To carry any weight, I just gotta carry on and wait
'Til a motherfucker carry all the weight
Hypothetically, though, I prolly tell you that I'm better than you'll ever be bro
I prolly tell you it's objective, I'm more impressive
You pressing play, and form a perspective
I'm guessing more or less it won't be competitive
Y'all adorable, seditive kind of rappers, so deplorably editive
Nothing's worse than when a moron's repetitive
I don't get it, how is everyone the same dude?
The rookie walking on the court like ""Man, I can't lose""
They playing Dicky, everybody in the room be like ""That's some shit""
Playing yo bum ass, they be like ""That's some shit""
Y'all are bubbles with the rapping
Lil Dicky get it popping, you could say he bubble rapping
The irony in all of this is I've been funny rapping
Yet the youngin's snapping to the point where all of y'all are funny rapping
Congratulations, y'all can write a hook
At my graduation, they was saying I could write a book
If a Rotten Tomatoes site existed for us rappers
I would be a 97, y'all would hover 'round a 64
Little Dicky spit that Pixar
Hope you seeing why I really like to spit hard
Only problem is I'm rapping to rappers
To the people that be listening, that world doesn't matter
Wanna know what the advantage of the rapper who black is?
The N-word is his antagonist
Before you get all huff and puff about it, think about it, be analyst
The fact they always use it's no accident
For example, I could be like ""Go figure
I don't think I'm one to fuck with all you ho...""
Y'all can fill in the blank
But that don't make it so you don't gotta rap at a rapper
That applies to every detractor
But even if I had a word like it, the nerd never disturbed
It's absurd but I'm looking 'round and ain't nobody verse me
I don't think a motherfucker's ever tried to hurt me
Every one I see has been supportive on this journey
Like where my haters at? I'm thirsty
I just really wanna talk my shit, be like ""Y'all ain't shit""
But y'all ain't shit, like, y'all don't exist
I could talk about the people that are dicks but I feel like that's whack
That'll get old quick, Robin Williams in ""Jack""
Who the fuck is my antagonist?
Is it you? Is it you?
If it's you, let me tell you something
You ain't even got a clue 'bout the shit that's coming
You don't wanna be the dude in five years like
""The fuck, I dissed that
Shit was pretty clear, how the fuck I missed that?""
You know that I ain't fucking light, bruh
I just fucked around and did this overnight, bruh
I just fucked around and quit a fucking job where I was making triple digits then the comma got involved, dawg
This wasn't rapping or trapping
This was rapping or a big ol' fucking house with a family
Who the fuck is listening that's been making Dicky so angry?
Is it you? Is it you?
I'm just waiting on some nonbelievers
The writing isn't on the wall, it's coming out your speakers
Anybody disagree, I'm being so facetious, homie I mean it
Forget the website, I'm the only motherfucking rap genius
Where you doubters at, I'm tryna hear it
Maybe it's the motherfuckers never paying mind to lyrics
I would dumb it down for y'all to try make it more appealing
But the ones who hang on every word think I'm kinda peerless
But even with no attention, you can kinda tell this motherfucker killing this section
You can kinda tell this motherfucker still an erection
But getting harder by the minute, just admit it, it's sexy
The funny fact about this shit, 
I gotta rap about the fact I wanna rap about this shit to even rap about this shit
Nobody been sleeping on Dicky
It's only been a year and bitches been sleeping on Dicky
Nobody took over the game with they first tape
This motherfucker hasn't struggled since the first grade
Add it up, there's no excuse to go berserk, Dave
Can't debate this shit, you got to skip, you not on first take
So what the fuck am I mad for?
What's some other shit that I could actually spaz for?
Maybe it's the fact that I've been stuck in this lab for
A hundred fucking days straight cooking up raps or
The fact this shit been taking over every thing in life
I gotta make it so I made the call to leave it all behind
That's my girl, that's my world, that's beyond being busy
Now the only one that gets to David Burd is Lil Dicky

See, I told you this about me
Go on and look up in the mirror, see with LD
Who you hate, boy?
Only care about me, said I'm straight, boy
Maybe I'm the one that gotta hit when I wanna murder shit

Lil Dicky,"And now a message from Hannibal Buress
Blaa, uh, sorry, sorry
And now a message from Hannibal Buress

Aye, mane, I'm fucking with this shit. It's good to listen to a professional rapper for once, but Lil Dicky is a horrible rap name. That's some weird shit; you got grown men having to call you Lil Dicky in the streets like ""Aye, what's up Lil Dicky. Bars man, you be spittin' bars"". That's real inconsiderate for you to make that your rap name and it's probably - Is that the worst rap name? I saw a dude named Hogman, The Intruder, no, I just made that up, but it's it's not the worst rap name I've heard at all, man

Here's some tips if you rappers wanna be more professional:
First of all, stop rappin' over your own vocals at your concert. Clear your goddamn instrumental and rap over it, I don't wanna hear you rappin' over your raps, muthafuckas. Also, stop have thirty five people on stage - who are these people?! Are you travelin' with these people or did you hire them locally? Did you pay for their travel? Get all of those muthafuckas off of the stage. It's confusing. I don't like it. You can't do that at other jobs. You can't be an accountant like ""Hey I'm about to do your taxes, here's my thirty friends just standin' around doing nothing while I do your taxes""; fuck outta here

Also, stop talkin' 'bout the same shit. I don't think you have a fresh take on havin' money. I'm tired of hearing about it, I don't, I don't think it's interesting. These muthafuckas need to mix it up. I think I've heard every perspective on havin' money or I used to have money and I oh I got money, I didn't have money, I got more money than you'll ever get, I never thought I would get this much money, I had money now I'm getting more money. Stop getting soo many chains. You don't need that many chains - you only need one chain. Or if you're 2 Chainz, you can have two chains, but not more than that",Hannibal Interlude
Lil Dicky,"Drunk, faded
Browned out, looking all shady
Two months since I fucked a lady
Young man dick going crazy
Standard Saturday
I'm about to get a cab and masturbate
Then I see a hot girl I bet I could date
""Lemme get your cat girl, no Hathaway""
Thats what I thought not what I said to her
Instead I walk up to her like
""I know you heard of the kid
You heard what I did
You heard of my shit
The murderous spit""
She's like ""Naw
You're being weird
What are you talking about?""
I'm like ""Aw.""
Pulling out my phone like a boss
YouTube bout to get her off
But as I type the y-o-u
Some porno pop up
I'm like
""Hold up, how di-, that's not even me like, I don't jerk off mobily.""
Then her friends coming up and want to know if everything is okay
I'm like
""Naw this a rape, can't tell? Give me a break please, get the heck away.""
I turned to her
""Let me buy you a drink.""
She like ""Fine.""
Told the man two Patron
She like ""Lime.""
Said he tried twice the card got declined
I'm like
""Are, is this, could it be a machine issue?""
He was like ""Naw.""
I was like
""Obviously there's something wrong
I got dough like, I'm not broke, I got donuts with the same card like about an hour ago.""
He like ""Dude, I don't know.""
Now I'm looking at the girl she just wanna go
And I ain't talking bout with me, bro. I mean alone
I got one more chance to prove myself so I'm like-
""Look, I'm athletic, girl. I've gotten several rec-league MVP's
At my crib I've got some pizza. Plus a little bit of weed
In my room I've got a TV. Plus I recently did sheets
Girl, I even have a fridge that has the water on the door like with the crushed ice""

She like ""Yeah, what do I say, can you just help me?""
""Ok, whats the context?""
Then she like ""Well, he talks to Jane before coming to me.""
""Who's Jane again?"" I said
She like ""Wow, you should know that.""
""Ok, I guess I forgot.""
She like ""Dude, that's my other boss.""
""Ok, true, so shouldn't your first boss go to the other boss before you? Right?""
""But Jane isn't hands on!"" she yelled
""Ok, well I just don't understand the dynamic then, I don't work with these people.""
She started crying
""Wait stop, what the fuck is this?""
""Naw, you don't ever take my side!""
About an hour later til' I'm on her good side
We in bed, hands on her good thighs
I try to kiss, she like ""Good night.""
But I'm like-
""Look, I just turned off The Departed for a movie about a bee
I've been cutting back on farting, tweeting, arguing, and weed
Yesterday I wore a cardigan at dinner with your sweet, and supportive
And during the fourth quarter, of the Eagles!
Now reward it!""

Fast forward some more, June 16, 2074
Old LD looking old as fuck
Still with the same ho, holding up
My life sucks, legs hurt
Friends dead, realtors
My dick looking like it's tinfoil
Her tits looking like they hard boiled eggs
On top of that, she insane
Like I don't even think she knows who I am
Our kids moved away, we've been doing the same shit for days
Maybe months, who knows
Probably going to die soon
Pretty scared I ain't even going to lie to you
Think about it all day, on my last legs
But I'm going out with a bang
I got pills they invented back in '57
I took five, that's a bit excessive
I look high, take a look at my thighs and good god that's a little erection
It'll work though
Now I've gotta find the ho
I'm pretty much blind at this point, I don't know if I mentioned that yet
But I am
Made my way into the bedroom and there she is
I'm like
""Look, I don't know if you're aware that you've been throwing out my shoes
What I do know is I'm sick of doing nothing here with you
All my blood is in my dick, I''m probably dying pretty soon
Are you even comprehending what I'm saying, please acknowledge that you hear me.""

You know I don't give a damn whatcha playing right now
This is me coming at you as a man right now

Lil Dicky,"Lemme freak! (I don't give a damn what you playin right now
This is me comin at you as a man right now, lemme freak)

I'm talkin to ya (lemme freak goddamn it lemme freak, just lemme freak)
Girl I smell that pussy across the room
There's no disrespect, they could make that shit perfume
Oh good god, I'm nasty
Don't look around girl, I'm lookin at you
What's good? I'm dave
What's your name? where you from? who you with?
What's your policy on birth control? when were you last tested? girl I gotta know
If you gon let me hit it raw, you gotta go
That would be crazy irresponsible

You know I only get with a bitch I mentally respect
We ain't even gotta fuck unless you and me connect
Minimally I'd like to ejaculate somehow though
Girl, I don't think I'm being unreasonable unless you that naive
That you thought this was a friend thing
I hope you not a freak so don't moan and spool your body soak and wet
My bad, I know I sweat (profusely)
Also, I won't fuck from the side girl, I'd lose like half my dick
Are you good about the pill?
Cuz even if it's foreplay, I should know that shits for real girl I got hella pre-cum
Also, I'm wondering bout the way that you cum
Like is it external stimulation or penetration-based? fuck it
You know I enjoy that way
But you know damn well, I just want my bed
They gon say I fell, I got blown away
I'm a hopeless romantic, girl I'm being dramatic but it's just the truth

Wait hold up, I should slow down
Don't even know you enough to go down
But if you want it we should go now
And we gon find out if it's great or it's strange

Oh girl, I could get you 4 to 8 minutes
Won't force the issue
Bitch it's too crowded
So girl if you bad then just give me that signal
But make it a loud one, I'm awful at this, hoe on the low, you [fire?] cut the shit
Girl what you tryin to do?
I got candles, nonpareils, and three condoms in my room
The nonpareils might be old as shit
Like they've been in there for a while
But fact of the matter is I don't want this to be no blip
I'd prefer to fall in love or swear I'm on some crazy shit (crazy shit)
Like honestly, I need someone to save the kid (save the kid)

It could be you but first you gotta let me freak
Just lemme freak, just lemme freak again
Girl, what's wrong with you?
I need to freak
I need to freak
I need to freak
Like please let me freak
Like please let me freak
Please let me freak right now
Please lemme freak, lemme freak right now

Girl we could get married
Like we could be fuckin
A daughter named bailey
That barely [?]
We gon eat so many goddamn meals
What's your name?
Girl, you better keep them dirty paws off my chicken lo mein

We'll talk the boundaries out together is all I'm sayin
And for the record girl I'll eat that pussy later
Like when I know you a little bit better
But for now it's just too intimate
Like it's too much
You don't even have to give me head either
Like I'm totally onboard with a hand job
Especially if there's like lube or some shit around
In a weird way, I actually prefer it to head
There's no guilt
No guilt at all
In fact, it feels just as good to me too if not better
I think it's a dick sensitivity issue
At the same time, there's no way you should complain about such a thing",Lemme Freak for Real Tho (Outro)

Lil Dicky,"Yeah, man, this is the softest thing I ever did
But it's about something pretty important to me

And that's you
And that's true
I really wish I didn't care about you anymore
But I do
What do I do when the rap-life
Make a motherfucker choose up in that fight?
Make a young couple do something sad like
Being broke up even though we had life

Fuck it, I don't even know what I could of done
Looking back thinking ""That's what I should of done""
Wanted you back
But when the fact is I always put you second to rap
I'm not mad that you wouldn't come
And even though I had to move, I ain't move on
Really wish you was a boo I could prove wrong
But she knows what I'mma do with the new songs
And she know them pretty soon when your dude on
Running the rap game, with that lane
Always got to be up on that train, or that plane
Ain't nobody wanna feel that pain, or that strain
Wishing I ain't gotta get that fame
Or I'd claim you, know I'd give you my last name
But that blame on me
Chasing something, feeling dumb 'cause you all I need
Hope you wait until I'm done and I'm all free
But you know I'm never knowing when that's gonna be
And I'm sorry

It's the hardest road to follow (I'm thinking of you)
I really wish that I could call you (What can I do?)
You can find another me tomorrow
And that's the hardest pill to swallow, babe

If I woke up and I called it quits ('cause I'm thinking of you)
If today I gave up all of this (I don't know what to do)
Maybe I could get you back tomorrow
And that's the hardest pill to swallow, baby

And that's you
And that's true
I really wish I didn't care about you anymore
But I do
What do I do when the rap-life
Make a motherfucker choose up in that fight?
Make a young couple do something sad like
Being broke up even though we had life

When I'm being dumb and stupid
Who the fuck is gonna hit me with the motherfucking jerk face?
Who's gonna let me know to hit my mother on her birthday?
Who's gonna let me know when I be shopping if a shirt's gay?
And when I'm on the road I be missing that
Always looking at my phone, you would give me crap
Ever since I've been alone I've been thinking back
Listening to you auto-tune in my mic phone making us laugh
You know the past was a blast but it never could last
Pretty sad when your love got a separate path
Used to read when there's nothing to do
But it's funny
Doing nothing's never nothing when it's something with you
You know I wanna still talk, even text and call
Whenever something going on I be pressing ""Moll""
Up in the phone til I press the X
Stressed the next one'll best the ex
And you'll forget, but it's best
You the best to me girl, always bake me something
And when they ripped off, you replaced my buttons
But don't be pissed off if I hate your husband
'Cause even when I can't say ""Love you""
I love you

It's the hardest road to follow (I'm thinking of you)
I really wish that I could call you (What can I do?)
You can find another me tomorrow,
And that's the hardest pill to swallow, babe

If I woke up and I called it quits ('cause I'm thinking of you)
If today I gave up all of this (I don't know what to do)
Maybe I could get you back tomorrow
And that's the hardest pill to swallow, baby

And that's you

Lil Dicky,"Oh well, I'm ignorant
But not to the fact that I'm ignorant, of course
I know that, I'm indifferent
I don't care to know what I don't
I don't care 'til I'm coming home
And my dad tell me some shit about when he my age, he was doing shit
Protesting about something that I forget currently
But that's not the point, the point is
To my pot, the boy is in the crowd devoid of giving a fuck
I would call his bluff but I've been thinking 'bout it
And shit, he ain't wrong, though
I don't vote but I think I did at prom, though
I don't know about a world if it's not home
I don't even know the first thing about what Obama do
I'm better off telling y'all what Lebron been doing
I don't even know what my mom been doing
I hit her up every Sunday
And we talk, but the call's going one way
In the dark, if it's not what I'm doing
Never been aware from the start, but I knew it
I don't even care how my tech work
If the shit work, put it there, turn it on, we can do it
Funny thing is I could look it all up today
And placate the debate within my brain waves
But the shows I watch all start at 8 so

Oh well
It's the season finale, so
Oh well
I kind of have to watch live, people are gonna tweet about it
Oh well
But I'm aware of all this stuff, I'll figure it out
Oh well

I do care when my phone's dying
Like, when that shit's red and I can't text
And I can't check what my fans said
I get mad stressed
Laying in the bed but I can't rest
Till my gram checked, wish I cared less
Leave it at the crib, I'm a damn mess
I should stop for a day, wanna try that shit
Drifting away, I wanna ride that ship
Dinner on the table but I'm unable to be tasteful
Underneath, I'mma like that pic
Watching the show on a phone, filming Coachella on phones
Hoping I capture the moment so I could post it
Don't live in the moment, hoping I'm still in control
But I'm praying I'm not alone
All the fans say I'm great at talking to 'em
They don't even understand I am not the man
I just can't go a day with being alone
When I'm with friends, though, why the fuck am I still on my phone?
Wishing I could look this shit up on Chrome
Wishing I could take a second to stop and reflect it
But someone just texted me

Oh well
It's actually like an important text
Oh well
I'm trying to solve, like, logistical issues
Oh well
It's time sensitive is what I'm trying to say
Oh well

I was gonna do a line, but I sneezed
I was gonna smoke, but I need weed
I just wanna roll up and then leave
But everyone keeps on talking to me
Like ""How's Mike Will? You know Rae Sremm?
I like ""No Type"" but I really hate them""
Like I asked for your opinion when I barely even know what day it is
I'm passed [?} loans and my rent
But I just bought new J's and shit
Going way fast on a one way road with the window down tryna wave at them
My mom says I should go back to classes
But I'm in the strip club and I'm tapping asses
And bitch look like Jacqueline Onassis
But she lies a lot and can't kick the habit
I've tried to stop giving passes to those who front it cause that's living backwards
And they give two cents when I ain't even ask them
Treat them like exams and I need to pass them
I twitching dutches, I don't do the backwards
But this gas station don't carry those
And I'm tryna smoke, man, how traffic
Here's a 20 and some change, man, you can have it like
No

Oh well
Oh well

Dave: ""What do you mean what do I mean by that?""

Dave: ""No, I-I enjoy it, I think it's funny. I'm just saying, like, I can't imagine, like, Puff Daddy or something talking to his mom and she's telling him, like, 'You better get a good night's sleep, you can't catch a cold.' ""
Jean: ""I-I, you know what, actually, you're gonna laugh at me. I disagree with you, I think anybody's mother would do that.""
Dave: ""Ok.""
Jean: ""And when Puff Daddy was 25 years old and the night before he was performing, I'm sure somebody was telling him the same thing. That's what mothers do. Black, white, Indian, it doesn't matter who we are.""

""Ok.""
""Ok.""
""So how are you gonna get strippers in Boston and New York and Philadelphia""
""The question is whether the clubs will allow it.""
""Uh, I probably only would get strippers for Philadelphia.""
""Well, you're breaking up again.""
""I said, I probably would only get strippers for Philadelphia.""
""But, but, a practical question in organization is, do they allow it?""
""Yeah...""
""Someone could research that for you. That's another detail.""
""Yeah, why don't you take care of that detail for me? 
""Figure out what venues allow strippers."" 
""Is that something you guys could handle or no?""
""No. 'Cause I don't know what venues...""
""You would have to ask William Mars or whoever's booking this stuff to find out for you.""
""We can't find that out.""
""Well, if like I give you, if I give you the venue name and number, you guys could call.""
""You could do that.""
""I, yeah, I'll call.""

""If your son could have strippers at his show, that's ridiculous""

Uh, I guess I assumed it would extend to the families but okay
While we on the topic
I been actually thinking about some shit
About the Army and Navy
What if tomorrow is the day
That the fucking aliens came
And invaded our nation?
Like, would we even be able to fuck with their shit?
Like do we have the type of weaponry to fuck with their ships?
So not at all, like would they just walk up in this motherfucker
Laughin' at us, and blastin' at us
And makin' everybody disintegrate and assimilate
Without a hint of intimidation?
Or could we do some shit to be making they heart race?
Granted I don't know the alien heart, but
You get what the fuck I'm sayin?
Like what the fuck would it be like?
Would they be like Earth go hard?
Or is it just another conquest?
Or would they be like damn earth go hard
They was harder than Simian
You ever talk to your brother about this uh type of stuff?

Who run the whole operation?
That be brain
(Brain, can you just get back to the issue here)
Uh, can you just remind the brain?
(You're such an idiot, we're talking about God and if he exists)
Don't call brain names
The brain couldn't recall
But if I'm not mistaken this bitch to my left
Guaranteed there's a god
(I believe in a god, yes)
So god never wrong
God never wrong, right?
Yeah, that's like the whole point
(Brain just get there, please)
Hold up
So god made the earth
And god was like hold up, this shit is boring
It need more shit
God was like Imma put dinosaurs on that bitch
Dinosaurs on that bitch
Then he like why I put dinosaurs on that shit?
What is your brain even saying?
Can he get to the point?

Hold up brain you just did it
God ain't wrong what the fuck was he thinking
About what?
Bitch, the dinosaurs
He made the Earth for them
But then he like nah?
Dinosaurs are just blah?
What's your point?
I'mma cook up some blondes?
Like he was way off
I don't look like a dinosaur
Ho them things 35 feet
I'm like 5 foot 11
But on Tinder I'm 6 foot
Seen that Brachiosaurus
That thing fuckin' neck go to heaven
And that's just an expression bitch
There ain't no heaven
Ha, funny
I'm just messin' but if he ain't wrong
I guess this the exception
Can I talk now?
Go ahead
Look
Everything in life has purpose
You, chickens, a midget at a circus
What?
I don't interpret
She like that's not for me to determine
So dinosaurs purpose was to just die?
That's not for me to determine
But ok
I'm just a person
Okay, but think of the root of the argument girl
View how we started this girl, like you don't believe in the aliens
You confine God to earth girl, I find that shit silly salient
I just don't presume to know the plan
Bitch me neither but that's not what I've been sayin
But what are you sayin?
Why can't God fuck with aliens?
Why can't Earth just be like a fucking small side project for this guy?
Ok, look we just don't see eye to eye
Yeah but logically like you don't believe in your side
Yeah but you're like bringing up fucking dinosaurs
Like we could have shared the earth with them nobody knows
Yeah, there is hard soil evidence girl
Like what's next you don't fuck with Pangaea?
She like lets change the subject
Ok
(This bitch don't know about Pangaea, uhm)
Brain leave it alone
I'm starving, are you hungry by chance?
Oh my god I'm so hungry
Yes, do you wanna get a pizza?
Fuck yeah. fuck yeah, I'm on it
Also I'm sorry about that whole interrogation thing
Come on dude I'm a grown up
I'm capable of having intelligent conversations
Okay, I just fuck it
Okay back to this pizza I lean pepperoni
Ugh
Sausage?
How can you eat that shit?
No, no, no, this not Dominoes
This legit, is high quality meat and shit
No, no, I'm vegetarian
Oh right, well we can get half pepperoni
And half of whatever you like
Uh, ew, I can't have that shit
In the same box
Seriously? You're that against meat?
No, I'm that against us being gluttonous
Thinking that animals live on this earth to get eaten
Okay, is it how we treat them?
Uh, that sure doesn't help
Ok
She like I'm not opposed to us hunting
But now we not trackin' them down
We just breed them to eat
That's disgusting
You should honestly read on the subject
Alright hold up
Just because we're not running around with a bow and arrow
Doesn't mean we're not hunting these chickens
We just decided the place to do our hunting intelligently enough
To manipulate these animals and get them to do exactly what we want
That's my point we just incubate animals
Instead of just letting them live how they come
But, that's just your God at work bitch
Why we go hard on earth
What you think would happen right now
If you left my place
And there were like three wolves waiting for you
Wolves?
Bitch, they would tear your ass up
Viciously
Like they would eat your titties
And your pussy
That's what they do
And your face and shit
Humans are smarter bitch
That's what we do
She like apples to oranges
Bitch that phrase don't make no sense
Why can't fruit be compared?
She like I'm gonna leave
There's just all of these conflicting principles
Right, enjoy your pepperoni pizza
I will, that's my god given right
She like where is my bag?
Oh that leather one next to the trash?
That's the one right? Made out of cow, I think?
Uhh why are there no Ubers in this area?
So you don't eat the meat, you just be wearing the shit
I'm not listening dude
That's barbaric as shit
Do you come from the vikings?
Why are you even still talking?
Do you take peoples land?
Do you fuck with the war?
How are there no Ubers anywhere?
Just download Lyft, they are bigger in presence out here
I don't wanna add shit to my phone
Okay the choices are clear, ho
Ubers are not around here at all
Taxis will come but they real slow

And the brain gotta poop
T minus 5 till the brain gotta shit

I just downloaded Lyft, but it's being so glitchy
Uhh, look do you just want to sleep here?
Uhh no thanks
It's past 2 am
I'm not sharing a bed with you
You can sleep in my bed, I'll just sleep on the floor
Fine, you're sure?
Yeah, it's cool
I won't throw you out to the wolves
Oh my god, you are so annoying
I couldn't help myself
But can you at least throw me a pillow?

I'm just pillow talking with a bitch
I'm just pillow talking with a bitch
I just finished spazzin' on a bitch
Now I'm pillow talking with a bitch

Brain gotta poop still
Please don't neglect the brain
Please don't neglect the brain

Hold on, is that my Lyft?
Nah, I got a pizza
Full pepperoni too
So, you're not gonna wanna be a part of it

Lil Dicky,"Hello, how can I help you?
Hi, my name’s Dave Burd, I have an appointment today
It’s probably under 'Lil Dicky,' actually
I’m a, I’m a rapper, so
Okay, and who are you here to see?
Uh, Snoop Dogg? Says here Snoop D-o-g-g
Oh, yeah. He’s right down the hall
First door to your right
Give him a knock and he should be right with you
Thanks. It’s uh, this door right here, right?
Mm-hmm, thank you

Grab a seat
Thanks I’m Dave very nice to meet
Dave, what it do? You can call me Dogg
Let me just check your sheet
No problem, sir, let me just say
I’m a big fan of the shit that y’all make
I can’t lie, I been thinking about this all day
All good, there’s a reason that we called, Dave
let me start with your background
Where you come from?
Sure, I was undergrad down there in Richmond
Before that
Oh, you talking bout my hometown?, yeah

I was born out of Philly grew up in a little silly old town called Cheltenham
It was in the suburbs, upper-middle wealth around
So real shit you ain’t never had to struggle for much
I wouldn’t say it like that, we just had a different kind of trap
Elaborate
Well I ain’t never had a tool, but I had to be the man at school
Like I was doing shit I had to do so when I finished undergrad
I’m cool and I can get whatever job I wanted
But the job you wanted wasn’t all that bumping
Yeah, and I saw it quick all the flaws that be coming when you grow up like that
Know you been racing them rats, you ain’t been making them raps
Boo hoo what a hardship
How you paid to get the rap shit started?
Man, my Bar Mitzvah money
But don’t diss me buddy, I wasn’t one of them younguns up on the block who had nothing to lose
I must’ve wanted this a lot, I had something to choose
Look at that, I can say there’s something to prove up in your ass
Yeah, I guess
That’s enough of the past, what makes you want to do rap?
Oh my god, it’s the best
Bitches let me draw up on their breasts
Literally I can reinvent myself
I get a forum to project myself
It’s never boring, every morning I wake up and try to best myself
I never got to be suppressed or stealthy to express myself
It’s kinda healthy
Cool, now let me put you through a couple hypothetical's
Sure
In a club and a couple niggas threaten you
Uh, I wouldn’t do shit
And I don’t even get what that got to do with this?
Shut the fuck up, rap's like life
If you wanna do this, then you won’t get far acting like a little bitch
Nah, that’s my niche!
Don’t get offended by this, but that’s the market y’all missed
That’s the target I’ll hit
And that’s the heart of my pitch
I wanna do this whole thing different
What the fuck you mean you wanna do the whole thing different?
Uh, you know, I-I think, like, you know
Traditionally people have been doing the job the same kind of way for a long time
But traditionally speaking, this shit works, right?
Nah, like, I get that, but I-I just think that, you know
You don’t know if it could be working even better
And I think you should look at me as an opportunity to find that out
I don’t mean any disrespect by that
I’m just saying I have a different background
Like a different perspective way of looking at things than your typical applicant

So what are your biggest strengths?
Well my flow is crazy, I can switch that amazing
For example, I can be like ain’t nobody fucking with Lil Dicky
When he get up on that shit and spit it sick and ridiculous
Ripping this shit like it’s never been did and the rhythm is never predictable
Cause I can switch it, deliver this shit to whatever cadence you bitches prefer
Alright, alright, I get it
Top of that, lyrically I’m pretty damn clever (go)
Got a long bottom bitch, called a hoe Neville (whoa)
And I blow it from the jump, Derrick Rose knee (oh)
You can say I’m pretty smart how I know better
And y’all been winning like Pistorius, it’s no feat
Bro, I can go on and on
I’m taking over and they mad like father-in-laws
Okay enough of the punchline, that ain’t showing me you different from the other guys
Well I don’t know if they can run it like that
But ain’t nobody else doing funny type rap
What’s that?
Well I can tell a story about my morning
Watching Boy meets World and jerking off to Topanga Lawrence
Like the 14 year old Topanga
Oh this shit like a joke to you?, I don’t get it
Nah it ain’t like that I just happen to be a nutty abundantly funny type of individual
Like, as a guy
So when I get up on the mic I ain’t finna just lie
Real recognize real, right?
Yeah, I guess. So what you trying to do?
Five years from now, tell me bout the due
Well, I don’t care about the money
Like, it’s the respect that I’m wanting
Honestly, I just want to be one of the greats
Where they gotta bring your boy up every debate
I don’t wanna leave the game the same
In a nutshell, what’s your legacy?
Well, I wanna be the dude that came in and made the stand up rap
With the random rap and the man like that for the people that was anti-rap
Yet, the fans of rap started recognizing anti-rap is ironically one of the real brands of rap left
That shit sound pretty damn complex
I guess, I wanna be the best
I just wanna do it my way
And turn the whole game sideways
And show people you ain’t gotta be resigned to the highway
You can make a path while these motherfuckers drive straight
I ain’t mad at that
Well thanks, man, that’s my plan of my attack
Just let me in and I’mma rap the plaques
And I ain’t about to win them back to back
I’m bout to win them like it’s back to back to back to back to back
Til I stop rapping
You ain’t even sold a damn album yet, true
That’s a lot of talk from a wily vet
Let alone a young rook nigga
You misread me
Nah this ain’t a book nigga
Well that’s one of my flaws, I’m too competitive dawg
No, you just fucking repetitive dawg
I get it, you trying to be better than all, but you ain’t shit until cheddars involved
I get that I gotta prove myself
No shit you ain’t done shit
But think about that though
Only doing this a couple of years
One tape and I’m like this?
This shit is aight for your first shit
But you don’t know if it’s your worst shit
You don’t think finding out would be worth it?
It might be, it might not
But I’mma put your ass to work, kid
Wait, like, like I have the job? Like really?
Well one more thing, let me see if you could put a hook together
What would you do for the hook for this song?
You want me to make a hook up right now?
Do I look like the type of nigga that like repeating himself?
Alright, uh, okay, man do the hook

I’m bout to be professional
Homie, I’m professional
Uh, maybe like a low voice type thing?
Nigga, that shit is garbage man
Well, you know, I feel like there might have been some upside to it
But I’m not good at thinking of things on the spot like that
Don’t y’all normally like outsource for that kind of thing sometimes?
Sometimes, but you know, that was some next level Dogg shit right there
Yeah, you know, I’m just way better when I get to think things through
Have my like that dual screen action that type of thing
Whatever man, you trying to smoke a blunt?
Right now?
Yeah, sure

Dope, Juanita, bring some weed in here, please, thank you
(You got it, Snoop, I’ll be right there)
Thanks, Juanita, super nice woman
Nigga, why does everything you say sound so soft?
Uh, I really don’t wanna be spoken to like that, so
Whatever, Thanks
(Hey, I got y’all y’all weed)
Damn, that’s some great looking weed, It’s just so early
(Can I get you guys anything else while I’m here? coffee? tea? head? bottled water?)
D-Did you just say head?
(Yeah. You ain’t never got no head before?)
I mean, Just feels like A lot, right now (ok)

But what kind of tea do you guys have?
(We got mint, raspberry, earl grey, English breakfast)
Actually, I’ll take head
(I knew your little dirty ass wanted some head.)",Professional Rapper
Lil Dicky,"I guess y'all on board
Young Man couldn't leave that shore
Had the life they made for him 'til he seeked out more
Boat rock, couldn't see that storm
Held it up, dawg
He know he close
It's too late to jump ship (Hey)

Aw, damn! Aw, damn!
You that motherfucker shit
I know
This here became a trip, Cabo
Up in the womb, but you can feel it when I kick it, I know
And you too must be rockin' with Lil Dicky, Bono
It's like I hit the lotto
I had to hit the wall though
I couldn't see it for a minute
Shit was hidden, Waldo
They treat it like I'm goin' crazy
I'm just prayin', I don't
It's just I know
It's just I know

I saw the world like, ""Hold up""
Damn near fakin' on the side
Let me take you on a ride
Let me tell you bout the one who couldn't take the 9 to 5
Use to take the 95 down to Richmond
Bumpin' Jigga up in the ride
Use to think along and drive
'Bout my drive
Used to wonder why
Used to wonder when the world'l see like I'm seein' mine
Use to whine
Use to wanna shine
Used to wanna dine
Used to talk to bitches in my mind when they were walkin' by
""Girl, what's happenin'? Girl what's happenin'?""
I ain't really 'bout to get involved that's what's happenin'
Errything I knew was unevolved like a Baptist
Layin' on my matress
Prayin' I could have this, and
Now when I get Tinder matches
They think they've been Catfished
Now I been controlling how we livin' like a facist
Now I got this weight up off my shoulders like a strapless
Remember this shit was hapless
Remember the day it happened
Aw, you the shit Dave, you be killin' everything you did
Got the whole world talkin' all about what you did
Got your old girl talkin' all about what you is
Got your old world lookin' like it's his you ain't here
I been fuckin' for the fuck of it
And one of the bitches I been fuckin' with
Been wondering how I can work this much and stomach it
She wonders what I want from it
I said, ""We don't gotta get into it""
She like ""Nah, just do it""
She a psychology student
She always followin' up
Find the guy to be amusing as fuck
Usually I'll answer her truthfully
But truthfully, I'm unusually used to being unusually good at internalizing when music is not provided
But I humor hoe
Ask her if she ever saw the Truman Show
She like yeah
I like well, when I saw that shit I was convinced I was livin' like Jim
A similar situation where I was the basis of everyone's entertainment
Like really up in the basement talkin to y'all
In the mirror because I thought Lil David was some American hero
I know it's selfish and all
But I just felt it's my call
I was a ten year old then
By 2010 I was wrong
I'm like

""Aw, damn! Aw, damn!
You the motherfucker though""
I know
That shit became a trip, Cabo
Up in the womb, but you can feel it when I kick it, I know
And you too must be rockin' with Lil Dicky, Bono

I had to hit the wall though

Twenty three bars up in my apartment
I am debarred
Gotta do this shit
I gotta recharge
But I gotta be smart
Movin' up that ladder company

Spittin' like a retard
Work was like a prison
I'm just seein' bars
My boss was all up in my camp
And I'm just seein' Lars

And if he can mold that out of ""Clay""

But off and on
There's always somethin' in the way
I should be off and gone
Girl I'm sorry if this draggin'
I just need you to imagine
Bein' stuck up on the land without a captain
When everyday is average
And everyday you feelin' like a captive
And feel like somethin' seriously lackin'
And then you fear what could happen if you just leave it on the table like napkins
But, yo, you really fearin' hitting them rappin's and leaving everything behind
Cause you don't know what that horizon brings
But girl you gotta know what kind of fish you is

Sink or swim
I flipped a playlist
Quit my day gig
Now, I'm on a boat, Lonely Island

This is everything I've thought
This for everything I've fought
This for who I am to me becomes to y'all

I just be tellin' them ""yeah"" (Go)
I just be tellin' them ""yeah""
Tell 'em I'm gone (Yeah)
I just pretend I ain't scared (Go)
Don't even know I was there (Go)
Don't even know if I care
Cause girl this is Truman approachin' the wall
Until I'm me I am nothin' at all
Until I'm free I will not see beyond
I had to be who I was all along
Ay

I think I mighta broke it down
Hoppin' on the fuckin' steps like ain't no around
Open up that door, you bet, ship ain't goin' down
Guess the only thing left is to take a bow

Aw, damn! Aw, damn!
You that motherfucker shit

And if I am taking public transportation
On the quiet train I might have a conversation
Fuck it i’m the man

Lil Dicky,"My own boss
Work

Last year I was taking them notes
Conference room every day is the woes
Last year at work
I was irked, I was irked
Tryna figure out them ad buys
This year at work
I been drinking with some black guys
Hey I done came up (sho' nuff)
Like, last year at work
I'm like oh, that's my boss, she a bitch
She know this
She looking at me every day
Like ""Dave, where you going?""
I'm looking back like, ""Hoe""
(I hate your demeanor)
""To print some shit"" but you don't even know
Now look what happened, now who rapping?

Now at work I ask to look at bitches' titties then this happens
Titties looking back at me like ""Dicky, boy, what's cracking?""
I look back at titties like ""I need a sec, I'm rapping""
Titties looking back at me like, ""take your time, you snapping""
I'm like, ""woo, I'm getting paid for that?""

I'm getting paid for that?
Nah, I'm getting paid for that?
I'm getting paid for that?
Nah, I'm getting paid for that?
(All of these hoes been on me
I'll never go back homie)

Homie last week I was up in Miami (great weather)
Got paid to chill in the club
Literally, chilling, like not even rapping
I think I did a good job
Sat there on Twitter, my new correspondence
Is going through all of these wonderful compliments
Used to be scrutinizing all these documents
Now when I sign off on something, it's body parts
Titty, booty, macking a cutie
Got a bag in the back of the room of the venue cause she copped that meet and greet
I got them going down in their prime like Aaliyah be
Used to post up, on time, no brakes
Not a purp poster on the vine, no grapes
Used to have to swallow all the pride
Had to piss out the slacks of the sack in the sweats every day
Used to buy brands, now the brands pay Dave

Like, I just got a box of Pumas, cause they think I'm cool
Watch me mention StarKist Tuna, watch my fridge get full
I used to sit and wait for Friday
But now my whole week like a Friday

I'm getting paid for that?
Nah, I'm getting paid for that?
I'm getting paid for that?
Nah, I'm getting paid for that?
(All of these hoes been on me
I'll never go back homie)

Last year I'm stuck up doing shit up in a cubicle
They tell me what to do, I'm thinking ""fuck that shit""
But y'all, I couldn't tell them what the fuck I'm thinking
Now they're paying just to listen to this shit, I got up on my lid
Got three or four bitches who 'bout to get the fourth down
That's a first, I remember when what lunch I picked was all I get
My bitch make that coffee, now only boss me around when we fuck
Was missing college but now they bringing me back, it's still fun
God damn Dicky, you too old to be fucking all these kids
Yeah, I know, but if you can rap, it's a lot less creepy though

I'm smoking weed in public, but it never seem to matter
Dump a bottle of water on your clothes and you ecstatic
I don't ever have to set alarms, I wake up supernatural
I can grab a bitch's hand and she will scream ""you so attractive""
How did this happen?

I'm getting paid for that?
Nah, I'm getting paid for that?
I'm getting paid for that?
Nah, I'm getting paid for that?
(All of these hoes been on me
I'll never go back homie)

I used to be up in Excel every day with a bitch (very proficient)
Now I just suck on my dick, suck on my own dick, man
I suck on my own dick, every rapper do it
Just a thing, an inside thing I learned
It's absurd, it's like, I'm in the industry now, so, I'm seeing shit
Every rapper suck they own dick, it's not just me

I grew up with niggas who snake they man
I grew up with niggas who got in that jam
I grew up with niggas doing life in the can
One time, fighting for land
But I grew up in the ghetto
Times I ain't eat nun, go to school just to eat lunch
No kid watching re-runs, wake up doing re-runs
My momma, my opponent (let's get it)
These millions I'm on it
And I gotta eat nigga
On the corners everyday with the lights out
Walk in broad day with the pipes out
Waking up middle night with the lights out
So why these niggas faking?
I pray to God that I make it
I tell my momma I can't take it (the ghetto)

Nothing to eat, nowhere to sleep, nowhere to go
People to meet, I'm from these streets

C-C-Came up in the ghetto
People tell me keep my head up my whole life
If I didn't have nothing, I'm fed up
B-B-Bitches out here, just shut up
Rest in peace my lil shawty
I promise I wish I could write you a letter
And I miss you momma
I trap like it's life because no one is promised tomorrow
Pray to my father
Lord forgive me for sins I committed
But this is the way that we living
Why can't no one see my vision?
Remember the basement, remember my aunty would beat me because of the dishes
Couldn't wait to get grown
Say to myself when I make it I'm gone from you bitches

Even though a nigga tryna make it out I still got love for the (ghetto, ghetto, ghetto)
I can't change, I was raised in the (ghetto, ghetto, ghetto)
Made me who I am and I love the (ghetto, ghetto, ghetto)

Please don't take it from me
Said I wouldn't change
I'm still the same, and they love it
You can hate me or love me
But I bet you remember, I bet you remember
Remember my name

They never remember
I did time for a gun, that I never remember
Did time with my son been delivered
I cried tears, I couldn't show 'em my position
No sleep in the hallways
Me being me, sipping lean with a .30 like always
Couldn't afford Trues, now I sleep on Versace and Balmain
Danny had the streets on lock so
Still slept with the rats and the cockroaches
Lost niggas, I lost bitches, I lost time
But I'm back on the block though
Gang with me also, but it's bigger than money
End counts all I know
They say I won't make it
Now they favor, I got 20 to play with
Grew up on Chicago South Side, where you get killed if you outside
And I made it out, and I'm outside
Name hold weight like a motherfucker
And I love my niggas like blood brothers
Same niggas, same gang can't change on 'em
One time, no movie
But I bet that clip gon' hang though

Don't forget about me
This bigger than money, this bigger than fame

But I bet you remember, I bet you remember
Remember my name

Real street nigga, made it from the bottom
Coming up as a kid niggas gave him nothing
12 years old knew I was a problem
All I wanted was money and the fame
Cars, cribs, and bitches wouldn't name
I can't change for nothing in this world
Lord blessed me two boys and a girl
Two dead 'cause I lost to this world
Crossed over like Flo Rida
Only my squad they both sliding
Money and power they both riding
Caught him and him and they both sliding
Trap house, block party, niggas doing the same shit
And got nothing
And niggas try me and that Mac bust
And they remember my name

Don't forget about me
This bigger than money, this bigger than fame
Remember everything that I did to get where I'm at

And if you cross me then I cross you
Ran off on the plug twice and I know they searchin'
If I got to say that shit twice then you know I'm urgent
His and hers Rollies get to shinin' lookin' like the ocean
Get on top of me baby and get to surfin'
Like surfboard
Sippin' on this lean got me paranoid
Gotta get this green so help me Lord
So why you with that hater shit?
Can't fuck with a basic bitch
I'mma tell 'em them lies

Everyday I spill my glass and I count up a check
Then I gotta go and get it
I lay my niggas to rest and you know whose next
10 toes, ain't no sittin'
How is you tryna finesse?
Can't finesse a finesser, the hustlers know it best
Gave the right niggas money, they say I'm a mess, no stress
I'mma count me a check
I'mma count me a check

I'mma count me a check, check, check
See you can't finesse a finesser
See I don't be with another X
No you can't finesse a finesser
Count me a check
I'm just countin' me a check

Money is the motto, these bitches don't wanna swallow it
Bitches want the fame, all they want me to do is follow them
She just gon' bring me drank 'cause she a pharmacist
Play my new single at the station 'cause I ain't callin' in
Niggas in the city wanna kill me, I ain't part of them
My niggas got 50 shot clips, they like barbers then
She can ride my 'Rari then 'cause she look like a Barbie bitch
If I catch her stealin' we all get our head like bobby pins
I'mma get this money 'till I d-i-e
Bring bottles to my session, to my VIP
I like my bitch's vest, let me see ID
Gettin' all this money like Lord why me
Gang in this bitch
100 dollar bills changed in this bitch
Got the Rollies and the chains in this bitch
We gon' shoot us somethin' strange in this bitch
'Cause I count me up a check

Everyday I spill my glass and I count up a check
Then I gotta go and get it

Better tell your baby mama, grab the kids
Run to the bathroom and flush the dope

Well, uh, it's self-explanatory, on what you should do
And if you was in the same situation, it'd be hard for you too
Well don't panic, keep it together, and make your way
We prepare for the DA police, and the feds everyday
And it's a must we keep supplyin, with that fried ice cream
And if anything go wrong while I'm gone, then baby do your thing
When you get to flushin, don't trust, nobody else
Pay attention, it's a must you play them cards that you dealt

It all happened so fast, like a flash
Feds bustin in like ???
I had to think fast, out the back room I'm rushin
To the bathroom, and start flushin
Quit passin no discussion
I ain't catchin no case, washed away, go down to the hall
No evidence ??? knows, it's evident that we control
Lettin 'em know that we on top, and we got, to step on our toes
While I'm, stackin my cheddar (...?...)

Lil Jon,"Once again up in that south from my motherfucking mouth
And creeping up on y'all niggas like a motherfucking mouse
Stepping on these tracks like fags and drag queens
And shitting on you busters like I ate some bake beans

Buster me and me's clicks, always making those hits
We never straight jam with no busters our no tricks
Getting in trouble from the sounds of my trunk
And keeping it crunk, keeping it crunk

[Chorus]
(What, What)
Now drop them bozs' on 'em [Repeats]

Nigga bozs' bout to turn out the show
Crankin' up yo' dance flo' screaming GA hoe
Flipping rhymes and gripping pines with haters looking round
It's time lay it down putting it all up on the line
Ain't no love for haters, smoking doug's potatoes
All these niggas what they made us from them' boz and craters
While lame done dipped out, we gained the flip flop
Underground where we dwell, the hell with hip hop
Southside just reckless, from GA to Texas
And next it's gone be me flexing in a suburban or lexus
But it seem like the bigger I be, mo' figures I see
The mo' hating niggas try me
Big baby trick crazy thinking he bout' to fade me
Better sit and wait in consequences fo' you feel you can play me
From a place called T-town be down in the south
Where them' players throw dem' boz and gold teeth in they mouth
And dump dump if ya' jump jump
The club crunk off the funk that we bump bump and pump pump
Through yo' speaker when it reach ya' now you tweaking like Beaker
All the people out there hype as hell, I guess it Lil' Peter
From T-town to Atlanta all the way to Savannah to Alabama
I be damn a club ain't crunk in this manner
I can't stand a weak buster
For all the freaks, hustla's, to the clothes
Y'all gotta get it crunk and drop dem boz, drop dem boz

[Chorus]

I can't afford bigger, how ya' figga'
That you gone stop me from stacking six figures
Now you hating on me, because my game so tight
And could you be mad because I fucked ya' wife
Well it's true, that's the price nigga check that hoe
I'm from the ATL player, wear that reckland ro'
So stop talking all that shit, and trying to buck
I'm popping off at the mouth, we get cha' fucked up, now what's up

Now ladies are you tired of trick bitches in yo' mix
Acting like they want, to lick on yo' shit
Criticizing, everything that you do
And telling ya' who, and who not to screw
Nasty hoes, that ain't clean and shit
They go around sucking on every dope boys dick
Now is these hoes really yo' friend or yo' foes
You tell me, while ya' drop dem' bozs'

[Chorus]

Now if the club packed y'all from wall to wall
And everybody trying to ball, coz sizing all
Ain't nothing but love in the air, we geeing and macking
Some haters off in there, but at least they ain't macking
You got cha' cup filled up, ya' niggas is crunk
Put cha' hands in the air represent where ya' from
I'm from the GA baby, where freaks is shady
Man it can be so crazy, so we burn trees daily
When the beat a drop, everybody just lock ya' boz and shake dem' hoes
And proceed to rock, from the front to the back
With the blunts and gats, on the hunt for some cat or a fat ass sack
Tear da' roof off the club, show you niggas some love
And fill a swishe up with bud for my g's and thugs
Now dem' haters keep watching, dem' freaks a jockin'
The beats is rockin', so partner want you keep on dropping
For my thugs

[Chorus]

Now right now I want all my hard niggas to follow me, follow me

I bring the pain, cock back and swing the thang
Yo' girl mad cause she told me don't even bring the thang
And then I told her, I said it's cool, get at me
And then my voice got raaaassspy
'Cause I was smokin' on some Cali and my eyes was dazed

'Cause niggaz will run up in yo ass like you a nasty bitch

And make a change, look into my eyes all you see is pain
Look up in the sky all I see is rain, ain't no sunshine
Call me a monkey, but look I got Kay Nine bloodlines
With P-9's and semi-autos, ain't guaranteed tomorrow
Maintain my burrow
I represent the slums, ate the crumbs
Now I'm reachin' for a new height
Nothin' but love and we glued tight
Played and renew sight

From canary yellow, ruby red to baby blue
One stone or maybe two
Fuck it cause we all can't be babies fool
Some of its jazzy
Some of it can't be real
Nigga say its sitting platinum
Knowing its stainless steel shit

On the necks of rappers
Drug dealers, Marks, ball players and stallions
? shit they buy them hoes by the dozen
O.G. nigga get a new piece
Pass the old down to his cousin
Spell out your name, your corner, your clique

You get some grade A rocks and in 20years they still shining
No need to worry, women will find em
But if they gaze at yo carrots for to long it will blind em
Cubic Zirconia helped the whole hood fine
Now that everybody can bling we having good times
I'm writing clever rhymes feeling like forever grinding
A diamond in the rough
Buff me up and hear me shine
I used to hit these streets and slang
Hustling in these peoples game
Now its just for piece n' thang
I ain't tryin' to preach you man
I ain't tryin' to heat your flame
I just wanna teach your brain
I'm so full of flavor I'm give some to the weak and blang

Touch me I'm in reaching range
Lets hit the beach and hang
For pimping ill be the blame

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
Ain't no tellin' what a bitch will do
For the doe, She'll probably get on four and fuck the crew
Down south, Up north be the same ass bitches
Man locked up but mama watchin' the children
Talkin' bout my neck my back
Bitch you better learn how to chop rocks if you wanna get with Crack
Ughh, I been in love once, at least I though that
till I fucked around and hit a broad back
Got burnt, Now you figure the rest
Dick hurt like I'm pissin' baguettes, now I'm livin' depressed
Should have known better than to trust a hoe
Especially she wanna know how much doe you hold
Cause there ain't too many real bitches
If you got one hold on, don't wanna be nobody's meal ticket
And you know it don't mean shit to me
Cause you know, Bitches ain't shit to me
What

And made you aware that life is more than a hair dew
Boy I tell ya, Best to deal with them real niggas
And stay far away from fuck niggas
Don't be a sucker, Hell at least not from nothin'
All this suckin' and fuckin' a bitch better have somethin'
I need something that is compatible
Not nothin' young and dumb and full of cum, But one that's edible
I bet a, Nigga like T Double
Get it wetter, Suck and fuck 'em better than the average nigga
I need a girl that's into tryin' things
So I can put it in her mouth, Fa real ain't into mind games
I know she's a mama girl and I'm a street nigga
Once we get together, I'll bet you she'll sleep better

[Dirty Mouth]
As I pull up to the club
Jumping out of the Jag
24's still spinning with a dealership tag
Brand New
Bright leather guts and pearl blue
These hoes they choosing like a lucky horseshoe
But that's alright cause I don't pay these hoes no mind
As I stroll to the front of the VIP line
Straight in I go, headed straight to the bar
I got a superstar status, so I guess I'm a star
Haters checking me out
Now tell me what's that about?
I'ma chill to the point haters checking me out
Sipping on the Crystal
Bitches want to get wild
Popping X and smoking dro' on the verge of my style
These bitches calling, asking where the after party
The Embassy Suites downtown, room 112, my darling
Bring your friends so we can let this party begin
And bring a box of Magnum rubbers so we can fuck till the end

[Jazze Pha]
Hey bitch, sign your name on the dotted line (well)
Cause you belong to me (you belong to me, yeah)
Hey bitch (hey bitch) sign your name on the dotted line (well)
Cause now you're mine

[LA]
Just pulled up at the club
I'm flyer than a motherfucker
Damn, why they staring? ho, shit I'm the motherfucker
Not the front door
We better go through the back
See, that was back then, now look where we at
Straight to VIP, my niggaz, man we deep
You gonna go through 2 or 3
Before you get to me
The bitch, and she a G and said ""what's up for later?""
I said ""I'm 20 East, I'm headed to Decatur""
And motherfuck the hater
It's about this making paper
And while she choosing hard, guaranteed I'ma take her
So shake the saltshaker, the dro' is the vapor
I ain't got love for niggaz cause all they try to do is cake her
I ain't sippin on no chaser, that's what we tell the waiter
You goddamn right, I'm a motherfucker player
So tell me how you want it
You riding? Get up on it
I ain't fucking with the ho if she don't know how to donut, for real

Cause now you're mine

[Lil Jon]
Hey, hey bitch
Hey bitch get up it's time to go to work
Time to go to work bitch, it's your boy Lil Jon
Never will I love a bitch
Why would I trust a bitch?
Always gonna dog a bitch
They only good for sucking dick
Or riding on a nigga cock
Trying to get a nigga stock
I'm never gonna break bread
Not even for a little head
I'm a player, not a cake-a-ho
Always gotta break ho, down to the fucking floor
You step up, I'll let you know
It's MOB, BME
P to the I to the M P
No, I'm Southside
Sorry, bitch, you better pay me

[Big Sam]
Old school white Lac pimpin like I'm Don Juan
When I pull up on the track, I toot-a-loo my horn
Make these hoes come running like Mike for travs
Ain't got my money ho, you bound to get slap
Cause I don't love a bitch and won't save a bitch
If it ain't about money, then it don't make sense
I'll mack a bitch and I'll pimp a bitch
As long as she making me filthy rich

[Don P]
Just up off the pill, drinking on my beer
Sitting on a mill, but I'm pimpin still
Riding round the track, like Goldie in the Mack
Still I'm Don Coreleone pimping hoes from my realm
Mesmerized by the words coming out my mouth
So I'm flushing money quickly out these bitches' bank accounts
After that I bounce

It's been a long journey getting' to
This motherfuckin' point of this crunk juice shit. (what?!)
But we done got to the last motherfuckin' song niggas
(last shit niggas!) and I got five of the hottest motherfuckin'
Emcees in the world, givin' you that gangsta shit!
It's the motherfuckin' grand finale!

We growin' doja in the basement in that underwater garden (okay)
When hereon in the bank shed, dry it 'til it harden
Make it hash up in the oven (man), put yayo in the hot plate
Drain and dry in the freeser, it's obvious we got weight
I said hard work, that's soft work even with wet work
Built-in clientele so we ain't gotta network (let's go)
We always got work, so we ain't gotta get work
And if you ain't gettin' your work from us you bound to get jerked
We yayo experts, we been whippin' the yola since the crackas decided to
Take the coke from coca-cola
Hold the rollers, the king of the trill
The underground as well, you can step in the ring when you feel
Nigga just sound the bell
Can't sound the heaters in this game, but the grind I'm lovin'
Nigga we passed all that pushin', man it's time for shovin'
I got the mask, I got the strap, soon as I find the gloves
We gonna start exposin' off like farhrenheit 9/11

I'm a speak clearly 'cause I don't think they hearin' me
A nigga only fear's gettin' charged with conspiracy
I'ma get it right to ya, sticky green white to ya
Wear whatever you want, bullets goin' right through ya
If you stressin' to get buried
My niggas'll send you back to the essence in a hurry
Sippin' crunk juice, blowin' dutchies in the chevy
Try to figure me out dawg, I'm light but I'm heavy
Yellow lemonheads in the bessie of the presi'
And yeah, anybody can rock but d-block rock steady (d-block!)
Fed's don't need no warrants 'cause y'all all informants
So I get higher than new york insurance
Try to keep shit clean like florence
Moved on up on the east side 'cause I never lost endurance
And it's all real niggas, if I ever get a license to carry
Shit, that's a license to kill niggas

I refuse to lose, I rather give these weak dudes the blues
And separate them from they jewels, teach 'em don'ts and do's
I raise tools, make crews make decisions confused
All spectators can say is, ""this lil' nigga's a fool""
A short fuse with some loose screws, some unscrewed
Better prove, you niggas pussy as the moulan rouge
So who guardin' who, you know who to you know what
To you know where, goin' 'gainst 'em's too unfair
'cause everywhere you do a show he got kinfolk there
Now you know I ain't no ?, I got ten folk there
They ain't powerful as the one at the end of your prayer
Got you runnin' for your life without a minute to spare
Catch you dead to the granite, melt the grease in your hair
When I go, them boys is gonna be indecent affair
Guarantee you nah a real nigga breathin' accounted
At your funeral, just your parents and the preacher was there
Hollow, television name-dropper reachin' for help
So I ain't gotta say a word, pimp you beatin' ya'self
You gon' get what you deserve for disrespectin' the game
Any nigga with the nerve to say another man name
When that other man ain't even present
And deny it when somebody ask him about it
That nigga's a lame, you like to lie on the mic
Hide behind fame, I was a g when I came
That's the way I remain

Who besides the egyptian-walker, fuckers have a conniption
My existence persistent to bring foes misfortune
I dassle 'em, like the alderman, billy dee in mahogany, minus the perm
From the tiniest sperm that the mightiest the almighty can muster
Project prophet, chronic blockage gives alzheimer's to youngsters
Amongst them is me, can't remembers my beefs
With who? for what? they screw-face me up, my boo laced me up
Bolinsiaga, flimsy condo with bimbos in south of kalan gro in pimp mode
The inf' glow on his clothes and you know it's over
Hammer hit pin, pin hit shell, from the shell the slug gonna chew ya
Try not to lose me, I try not to lose'ya
Mama say mama sa mu makasa, fly to cuba
To chill with some politi-kill niggas who ill
'cause y'all niggas are losers, don't get comfortable nigga
Say hello to mr. bad guy, get that cash par, I'm the last don
You'll ever know so, here you go y'all can take these thoughts
Anyway I'm chargin' emcees a late fee cost
So when y'all done with my style, please break me off
But never make nas mad just in case cross

What you heard about a nigga so true motherfucka'
See I'm ugly and prettay, I'm polished and grittay
Shoot better than that nigga that tried to kill 50
See, niggas get shittay when I come to their cittay
When I hit the spot that bitch they like, she cummin' with me
Cause I got an ego big as to, but I'm not an eagle
Bitch, I roll with rigo 'cause gangstas don't dance we boogie
I told you motherfuckas kobe didn't take that pussy
Get money, get paid, you can beat that shit
Even if the da is a piece'a shit
Colorado got movatos, don't eat that shit
Another white bitch lyin' on thee black dick
I keep it flippin' like flapjacks, pimpin' like black 'lacs
Give niggas flashbacks, they sweaty as ass cracks
When I hit the tar mat, it feel like a carjack
Niggas get out and vanish like star treks
So fuckin' incredible, I'm so fuckin' credible
No matter what happen, I'll never turn federal
And that's my report comin' straight from cali

If I ask for some chips, then she stackin' it

And I don't mean no janitor, the way she mopping the flow
Tattoo on her backs saying 'ready to go'
Man this girl must get pimped away I'm ready too hoe
I'm going to take you out to ghetto girl around the globe
Freaking in the kitchen girl, go somewhere around the stove
In the chumps we chilling in some hotel robes
I put her towels on her body and massage her toes
There ain't nothing like some sex on a Friday night
But then again nothing like some sex in any night
After that gotta go got appointments girl

Now listen up close, I won't say it again

At the bar behind all the most expensive shit
And his car always got the most expensive kit
So his gun always got the most extended clip
Hey! Luda Luda, I'm built to last
Nicknamed double barrel and I'm built to blast
Since your girl ain't a freak, well you gotta convince me
Cause I'm all up in the fifth getting straight Lewinsky
And smoking some of that ""Kill Bill""
Ten Mil motherfucker I'm still trill
Can't party with the women that like it dick
Refuse to cut my hair like Michael Vick
Dirty bird even judges say the birds are dirty
We the reason that the clubs start closing early
Walk up and watch the crowd start moving quick
And I ain't gotta pay the DJ to play my shit

Yeah, hey, hey, hey
With the bull pimp cup man I'm sloppy drunk
I don't broke into club it's the king of crunk
Let the anal way find, and and the woofers blow
Throw some ass in my lap and I'm good to go
I spread a shined out bottle, crack a beer
While the ladies are all rubbing my neck and beard
No need to even ask it, who's the boss?
When the dreadlocks slam and the roof come off
The crunk juice got me up all night shit
And in last year making that bite shit
Not an essay calling me Loc De Niro
Stunned with my hell day, Oaklezero
Fresh by the front and I'm ready to play
Got the dog but I knew my had to lie (ok)

Hangover, wait a minute girl you leaving your clothes
And tickets gonna sell for a major show
If yousa a hater at the booth and the booth is closed
And move out the way I'm a Luda fan

Why you got me so messed up?
I don't know, but you gotta stop trippin',
Be a good girl now, turn around, and get these whippings,
You know you like it like that,
You don't have to fight back,
Here's a pillow-fight that,
And I'll be settin' separate plays,
So on all these separate days,
Your legs can go they separate ways

Don coochie hole bitch, better known as pimp coochie hole
Pimpin' Ken the Don in this shit ho
You know what I'm talking about, yeah
Milwaukee, Wisconsin you funky ass bitch

As I pull up to the club
Jumping out of the Jag
24's still spinning with a dealership tag
Brand New
Bright leather guts and pearl blue
These hoes they choosing like a lucky horseshoe
But that's alright cause I don't pay these hoes no mind
As I stroll to the front of the VIP line
Straight in I go, headed straight to the bar
I got a superstar status,
So I guess I'm a star
Haters checking me out
Now tell me what's that about?
I'ma chill to the point haters checking me out
Sipping on the Crystal
Bitches wanna get wild
Popping X and smoking dro' on the verge of my style
These bitches calling, asking where the after party
The Embassy Suites downtown, room 112, my darlin
Bring your friends so we can let this party begin
And bring a box of Magnum rubbers so we can fuck till the end

Hey bitch, sign your name on the dotted line 
Cause you belong to me 
You belong to me, yeah
Hey bitch sign your name on the dotted line 
Cause now you're mine

Just pulled up at the club
I'm fly than a muthafucka
Damn, why they staring ho, shit I'm the muthafucka
Not the front door
We better go through the back
See, that was back then, now look where we at
Straight to VIP, my niggaz, man we deep
You gonna go by 2 or 3
Before you get to me
The bitch, and she a G and said ""what's up for later?""
I said ""I'm 20 East, I'm headed to Decatur""
And muthafuck the hater
It's about this making paper
And while she choosing hard, guaranteed I'ma take her
So shake the saltshaker, the dro' is the vapor
I ain't got love for niggaz if all they try to do is cake her
I ain't sippin on no chaser, that's what we tell the waiter
You goddamn right, I'm a muthafuckin player
So tell me how you want it
You riding? Get up on it
I ain't fucking with the ho if she don't know how to donut, for real

Hey bitch sign your name on the dotted line 
Cause you belong to me 
Hey bitch sign your name on the dotted line 
Cause now you're mine

Hey, hey bitch
Hey bitch get up it's time to go to work
Time to go to work bitch, it's your boy Lil Jon
Never will I love a bitch
Why would I trust a bitch?
Always gonna dog a bitch
They only good for sucking dick
Or riding on a nigga cock
Trying to get a nigga stock
I'm never gonna break bread
Not even for a little head
I'm a player, not a cake-a-ho
Always gotta break a ho, down to the fucking floor
You step up, I'll let you know
It's MOB, BME
P to the I to the M P
No, I'm Southside
Sorry, bitch, you better pay me

Old school white Lac pimpin like Don Juan
When I pull up on the track, I toot-a-loo my horn
Make these hoes come running like mice for traps
Ain't got my money ho, you bound to get slap
Cause I don't love a bitch and won't save a bitch
If it ain't about money, then it don't make sense
I'll mack a bitch and I'll pimp a bitch
As long as she making me filthy rich

Took a bunch of pills, drinking on my beers
Sitting on a mill, but I'm pimpin still
Riding round the track, like Goldie in the Mack
Still I'm Don Coreleone pimping hoes from my realm
Mesmerized by the words that's coming out my mouth
So I'm flushing money quickly out these bitches' bank accounts
After that I bounce
To another ho, in a totally different city
For a whole other show
They say, ""why you don't call?"" I say, ""bitch, where my dividends?""
""You always out of town"" I say, ""bitch, where my dividends?""
""You probably in the club"" I say, ""bitch, where my dividends?""
You bout to make me break your neck, I have to ask your ass again
I'm Don a.k.a ""stay pimpin hard""
That mean hoes gonna march winter, summer, spring and fall
Cause I have to ball, there's no other way
Even if the bitch pregnant, there's no Happy Mother's Day

Hey bitch sign your name on the dotted line (sign right here)
Cause you belong to me (you my bitch now)
Hey bitch (hey bitch) sign your name on the dotted line (right here)
Cause now you're mine (you mine, ho)

Get your ass up

If you get out line, I'm a slap your eye
I'm a slap your eye
I'm a slap your eye
Better have my money why
Ou better have my money, bitch)
Cause you signed your name on the dotted line
So get off your ass and get on the grind
Get up, get out there and make my motherfucking money, right now
Forgot what I am, bitch? What am I?
I'm a pimp in every inch of the word
Inch of the verb
Every inch of the curb
I'm a hit, like the lottery baby
Better believe it 
Please believe it
Hey, yeah
If it's pimping you wanting, pimping you needing 
Everyday from me 
From a real motherfucking pimp
But bitch that's all I can see
Any day of the week, when you fucking with me

If you fucking with me, you better get your ass out there
And make that muthafuckin money
Rain, sleet or snow
Rob, steal and kill for a muthafuckapimp like me, ho

Lil Mama,"[Chorus:]
In the mirror I'm lookin' at the shadow
If I bash her I'll probably would just shatter
Broken pieces that represent my heart
Broken pieces keep fallin' from my heart
In the mirror I'm lookin' at the shadow
If I bash her I'll probably would just shatter
Broken pieces that represent my mind
Broken pieces keep fallin' from my heart
Cause I know what I'm feeling
And I know what is real
Broken pieces that represent my heart
Broken pieces keep fallin' from my heart

[Verse 1:]
Everyday when I wake up
I wanna see yo face and I
Realize that you'll never apologize
For yo lies and all the ways you hurt me
And I know in my mind that you ain't worthy
But when I look in the mirror
I see this girl who keeps cryin' she's cryin'
She still in love with you
But I tell not to cause she's wildin' she's wildin'
I don't know what she's thinkin' about
Get it together or I'm gettin' you out
Of the mirror
I'm gettin' you outta my system
My vision premonition
And I listen to my answers
And free my soul from prison

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
My patience a plastic bag
And he kept fillin' it
Carryin' baggage of others
Is where I emptied it
Played the fool before
I'm not about to let you enter
My mind for my heart draws the bigger picture
His presence embrace me
His lovin' so greatly
I miss the way we
Use to sit up all night
And talk about nothin'
On the phone
Please how could you be so weak
When you know you deserve so much better
And rather than settle for less
Just let the best play catch up
When the time is right they'll find you
If you choose to
Do not do
The best I could do
Is warn and inform you
The mirror

Where I study my academic stare run
And the books so worn and torn I can't think
How they tried to cripple me
Understood the lost side of me
Thank god I had a good teacher on the side of me
Showed me the right things to do
Overcame these obstacles
Haters stand up for the things that we've been through ooh

Here we got these buildings called projects but they ain't three stories
They fill about ten on the block April flow go up by twenty
Stories I tell be true story kids cut school and watch Maury
Like if they ain't intellect in what's affecting my life I can't respect them
But that's just they way of the ghetto
People who come from where I'm from get it
But we still gotta make a difference
Stand up tall so the world can get it
Teach kids pride instead of ""Outside""
Show another side and they show goin' rise
Stop letting responsibility fall
I can tell you ain't been around my way at all

Why don't you come around(way)
So you can see what my(way)
Eyes been seeing why(way)

And quick to attack if they sense what they don't like like

Cause if I walk with him
He gon' still my speed so I can't talk to him
But if he keep up and fight through the waves
Fight through the pressure and the gust of your days
Test water with toes and dive in brave

Threw his life jacket on and still can't catch this

This I know its true you're my love bird
And without you I'm through
So I wrote this song  just to let you know what you mean to me
Me & you
You & me
Fulfilling each others fantasies
This will never die
I'll promise I'll stand beside you
Forever I love you baby
Forever mine

Oh you still don't believe me
Mija I told you I'll be there for you don't worry
I don't gotta have to... You know
I don't have to show it to you  every single time
You know what I mean
But just know that I do love you baby
You know what I mean
At night I always look up to the stars you know  what I'm sayin
There beautiful... But you know what there not as beautiful as
You

Till death do us part thrill me with all of your charge
You're my latin queen never leave you lonely
You mean so much to me
When we make love we make all the birds
Forget the bad things only the good times we share
Can make us happy
why mija tu sabes whenever you need me I'm here I'm not
Like those other vatos who left you alone
I won't disappear
Tu eres mi mami, mi angel, mi amor
why tus besos bienen with sabor
Baby don't think I'm only trying to waste your time
Your nombre is on mente till the end of time
Forever mine

So tell me what's on your mind now mija
Now... you know I love you right?
And like I said I'm sorry for not telling you before
But I know you knew
Know what I mean
I know there's gonna be like a lot of ... 
A lot of trouble in our relationship
But I promise you one thing
No matter what I'll never let you down
I love you
to the end of time",Forever Mine

[Verse 1]
Hey here's a little story 'bout a nigga like me
I fuck bad broads live large and drive V's
Some say I'm cocky and rude I might be
But nigga fuck you, you ain't got to like me
I'm at the bar taking sips of long island ice tea
Wrist looking' blue or icy I'm pricey
Bitch niggas mean mugging' and starin' all shiesty
Don't make me pepper spray your face have you lookin' all spicy
Cause I know you niggas hatin' and want to fight me
Thinking I'm all Hollywood like Spike Lee
Thinking I'ma steal you and fuck up your white T
When I catch you in your jaw I'ma fuck up your white teeth
But nigga I be ready to scuffle like dice peat
And ya'll walkin' outta this tussle ain't likely
I hope you boys ready to rumble I'm quite deep
And I ain't friendly but I'ma tell you politely

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Say I'm the type of cat  when I pull up in the place
you hatas like a blow job put it in they face
I buy the goochie shoes matching belt lookin' great
Dubs sounding cool you can tell I'm pushin' weights
Courtier full of flakes snow storms in the peaks
Hoe taming nigga keep my bitch on a leash
You the typa cat that'll chase a chick for weeks
Then try to box a nigga when you hear he hit your freak
But playa don't you know you outta line that shit is weak
And fightin' over broads will get you killed up in these streets
You running round here plexin' always thinking shit is sweet
Then have the nerve to wonder why them bullets hit ya cheek
Then want to step to me talkin' but (Oh you foul!)
All up in my face talking bout (You hit my gal)!
I'm looking at him stupid like man this shit is wild
You better give me space asshole I ain't ya pal

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I keep my game on face when I'm riding on chops
Straight gorilla pimp don't even wave to the bops
Lookin' like a snail crawlin' slow through the lot
Fist full of grain other hand on the glock
Cause when you want fee jackers want what you got
That's why I stay ready with the inferred dot
The first one to jump is the first getting shot
Put the beam on his head then I take off his block
You love to rob O like take off you rocks
Take off your shoes playa take off your socks
But I'm the type of cat before I take off my watch
Aim at your chest and try to take off you heart
You know how I do playa shake off tha marks
Hit him with the big guns that take off a part
Chest lookin' like he been ate by a shark
Bitch you better mind stay in line play it smart

and stay fly from her toes to her hair

Yo, I'm internationally known on the microphone
I got it all, but I really need a wife at home
I don't really like the zone, never spend the night alone
I got a few, you would like to bone
But, chicks don't romance me, don't tickle my fancy
Only Tiffany, Nancy; that's not what my plans be
I need a girl that could stand me, raise me a family
Go to trips at the Lancy, trip to the Grammy's 'cause
Most of these girls be confusing me
I don't know if they really love me or they using me
Maybe is the money, or maybe you ain't used to me
'Cause you was depressed and now you abusing me
That's why I need a girl that be true to me
Know bout the game, and know how to do to me
Without a girl on my side, shit I ruin me

I want some real shit, I need somebody I can chill with
I need somebody I can build with
I need somebody I can hold tight

I had a girl that would've died for me
Didn't appreciate her so I made her cry for me
Every night she had tears in her eyes for me
Caught a case, shorty took the whole ride for me
First we were friends then became lovers
You was more than my girl, we was like brothers
All night we would play fight under covers
Now you gone, can't love you like I really want to
But every time I think about your pretty smile
And how we used to drive the whole city wild
Damn I wish you would've had my child
A pretty little girl wit Diddy's style
This shit is wild
All damn days that I reminisce
About the way I use to kiss them pretty lips

I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm a motha f***in' Cash Money millionaire

Junior
It's cash money over everything
It's in my blood I feel it running in every vein
I'm from the mud I am a missile like the stud
What's really good, I'm about to ruckus like fud
And I stay on my flow and Cash Money like a rug
Tied to the f***in' Birdman like a log
And dear Mr. Ronald Williams
To you I shall forever give thanks like a billion
Cash Money million, hier to the throne
Going at the head is like hair and a comb
Sittin' by the window, I just stare at the stone
Knowin' I might get through it like hair and a comb
Know money over b****es, my n****s trust my sisters
And I will take or trash it with the lord as my witness
And you all have witnessed, but I am not finished
So keep your mouth closed and let your eyes listen

[Chorus]

Last year they had the Grammys and left me in Miami
Sleeping on a n**** like I'm rapping in my jammies
I'm rapping when you sleep, I was rapping when you were in jammies
Mel Gibson flew lethal weapon book em' Danny
I'm a monster I tell you monster Wayne
I have just swallowed the key to the house of pain
Now I'm stuck here to deal with the house's pain
F*** with me, I will peel like the house's pain
Let's go, n****s don't see me cause I'm better than both
The only time I will depend is when I'm seventy years old
That's when I can't hold my s*** within so I s*** on myself
'Cause I'm so sick and tired of s***ting on everybody else
I'm tryna tell you like I saying something
I'm from the dirty like the bottom of my pants cuff
And there ain't nothin' gonna stop me
So just envy it, hey, I'll accept a friendly quit
(ha) yea

[Chorus]

The hottest, under the sun
Ain't nobody f***ing with me, man
And you already know that, pimpin'
Cash Money Records, where dreams come true
Somebody gon' die tonight
And you already know that, pimpin'
Hey it's Cash Money Records man
The law in this game",I'm from H-Town
Lil Playboy,"Bounce, bounce, bounce, Jay-Z huh?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Roc-A-Fella y'all, ha ha
Bounce, bounce, bounce, Roc-A-Fella y'all
Check, check

Yo, I'm making short term goals, when the weather folds
Just put away the leathers and put ice on the gold
Chilly with enough bail money to free a Big Willie
High stakes, I got more at stake than Philly
Shopping sprees, coping three
Deuce fever IS's fully loaded, ah yes
Bouncing in the Lex Luger, tires smoke like Buddha
50 G's to the crap shooter, niggas can't fade me
Chrome socks beaming
Through my peripheral I see ya scheming
Stop dreaming, I leave your body steaming
Niggas is fiending, what's the meaning?
I'm leaning on any nigga intervening
With the sound of my money machine-in
My cup runneth, over with hundreds
I'm one of the best niggas that done it, six digits and runnin'
Y'all niggas don't want it, I got the Godfather flow
The Don Juan DeMarco, swear to God, don't get it fucked up

I'm taking out this time
To give you a piece of my mind (cause you can't knock the hustle)
Who do you think you are?
Baby one day you'll be a star

Last seen out of state where I drop my slang
I'm deep in the South kicking up top game
Bouncing on the highway switching fo' lanes
Screaming through the sunroof, money ain't a thing
Your worst fear confirmed
Me and my fam' roll tight like The Firm
Getting down for life, that's right, you better learn
Why play with fire, burn
We get together like a choir, to acquire what we desire
We do dirt like worms, produce G's like sperm
Till legs spread like germs
I got extensive hoes, with expensive clothes
And I sip fine wines and spit vintage flows
What y'all don't know?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, cause you can't knock the hustle

But until the late thang I'm the one who's crazy
Cause that's the way you're makin me feel
(Cause you can't knock the hustle)
I'm just tryin to get mine, I don't have the time
To knock the hustle for real

Yo, y'all niggas lunching, punching the clock
My function is to make much and lay back munching
Sipping Remy on the rocks, my crew, something to watch
Nothing to stop, un-stoppable
Scheme on the ice, I gotta hot your crew
I gotta, let you niggas know the time like Movado
My motto, stack rocks like Colorado
Auto off the champagne, Cristal's by the bottle
It's a damn shame what you're not though (who?) Me
Slick like a gato, fucking Jay-Z
My pops knew exactly what he did when he made me
Tried to get a nut and he got a nut and what
Straight bananas, can a nigga, see me?
Got the US Open, advantage Jigga
Serve like Sampras, play fake a rappers like a campus
Le Tigre, son you're too eager
You ain't having it?  Good, me either
Let's, get together and make this whole world believe us huh?
At my arraignment, screaming
All us blacks got is sports and entertainment, until we even
Thieving, as long as I'm breathing
Can't knock the way a nigga eating, fuck you even!

I'm taking out this time
To give you a piece of my mind
Who do you think you are?
Baby one day you'll be a star

I didn't know why
You didn't show up sometimes
On Sunday mornings
And I missed you, but what we talked through
All them grown folk things, separation brings
You never let me know it, you never let it show
Because you loved me enormously
And so much more then to say
If you were with me today

If your ass wants to live another day
Get the fuck out of my way when I lyricly slay
Bring it on all my foes
Mr. Shadow be the one killing mothafuckas
Like told shove em all in holes
Lke a ghost I'ma hauncha mothafuckas make the stories tie
I can hear the cries I sing when you bring it with more jealousy
I give a bullet and begin to do the fool like I do that vatos mine
To the night with a sight when
I look the moon is full and get tool and look for my foe
Got that five footed star on my chest so you know what it is that I'm searching for
Murder you heard of me makin it dark like an eclips
Like ""Tales From the Crypt"" I come equipped with the triple six
And I'm bound to get sick
It's The evilest lyricist bringing this wickedness nemisis
Giant on my premisis withnessin part like the Exorcist
Cause I'm comin to get em like every day
You run and you can hide but you won't get away
It's the game that I play like the quija board
You can't see me but you will believe me, and need me
If you look a little closer you can see The Shadow of a demon appearin
I'm hearing the voices that tell me to do the evil shit that I do
And you know that I'm due so I do when I cast my spell on you
The evilness just fell on you and I'm the perfect fool to wish HELL ON YOU

[Demon Voices]
Tonight, 781 to your area
You know it's gonna happen tonight
But of course, 781 to your area

[Lil' Rob]
Creepin up on your ass you won't even see or hear me coming
Be running I'm becoming some thing evil fuck people fuck sequals
Got to get the murder done now, all I see is the fear in your eyes
Your tempature rise, You're terrorized
Don't be surprised, I see my reflection like a mirror in your eyes
Every thing gots a price, but you got a price to pay
I sold your life away, you stole a slice away
Dealin with your life I took your strap, your price is right
Could tonight be the night that I feel some thing come over me
I don't know what it is with a devilish grin
Foes and friend and bloody sin
Don't know when it's gonna end
Just like a puppet on a string he'e controlin me
I try to be cutting those string but like smokey he gots a hold on me

[Devil's Voice]
That's the fool that rolled on you
That's the fool that stoled on you
What the fuck you gon do
Fuck it I'll do it for you

[Lil' Rob]
I'm having a conversation with somebody who's not even there
Hearin the voices inside my head saying you'll get no where he you care
I be the Lil' Rob going insane when he calls me name
I'm hearing voices in my head and every night I do what said

[Demon Voices]
Lil' Rob... tonight is the night
I better listen to my master
It's good bye, tonight is your night
You should of never messed with me
Never mess with, maricon

[Lil' Rob]
It's the satanical, magical Lil' Rob and The Shadow
We're coming at you like horns my mother regrets I was born
And I know you like it like porn treat the streets like hors leave em torn
In drop my rhymes like the storm when it rains it pours
I take form and I...
Hit the streets looking all nice and neat top fully creased
One hell of a looking beat the least of my feats from west to east
From north and south not knowing what it's all about top me on scout
Looking for my new recruits to follow my foot steps down my route
If you're not in you're out, to know what I'm feeling
I'm beggin you to stay and if you wanna come play
But if not your better pray cause I'm coming your way

[Mr. Shadow]
Krimes pays when ever the fuck I inflict pain with pick
And I'm coming to stick you let satin be with you
Nobody will probably miss you when I diss you
If you want to fuck around with these two blad headed mothafuckas
That'll leave you in the mist when I clutch my fist
I'm pist you missed Apocalypse, I can't resist the bloodyness
The mess ain't over on 31st of October, I toldcha
The Virgin Mary won't hold, I'll scoldcha and moldcha into a deamon screamin
I'm leavin you sufferin wonderin why
I have a tail a pair of horns and glowin eyes
Baptisted in boiling water fuck the father I fucked his daughter

So now you know that you're gonna fuckin burn in hell
Tell what you think then I will meet you at the crossroads

Lil Rob,"Southern California
Home of low-ridin'
Gang-bangin' and shit
California

I was raised in the streets of California
(Southern California, home of car-hoppin' and bomb-droppin'
West coast pop lockin', walkin' how we're talkin')
I was raised in the streets of California
(I was raised in Californ-I-A
Where homeboys die everyday over some shit they say)

I've always been down with hydros
And cholos, the low-lows
The six-threes, the six-fours
The rucas with no clothes
Used to drop the two-door
Gang-bang in a four door
Puttin' bullet holes
In the doors of a Ford Explorer
Hard-core, and I got more and more
Where that came from?
Welcome to my kingdom
The streets are my freedom
I need em', I feed em', I feedback
They need that, like I need my weed sack
Take a toque, wacha
Where were we at?
Oh, California the golden state
Controllin' states, pushin' weight
Where vatos like me hallucinate
Double up while you fumble up
Fuckin' up, you fuckin' punk
If there's no room
Then we'll stick em' by the fuckin' pump

I was raised in the streets of California
(Southern California, home of car-hoppin' and bomb-droppin'
West coast pop lockin', walkin' how we're talkin')
I was raised in the streets of California
(I was raised in Californ-I-A
Where homeboys die everyday over some shit they say)

Slippin' and dippin', grippin' the wheel
Lockin' it up
Dump the back corner
Pop the front one up
Put the convertable top down
It's too good to stop now
This California livin'
Smoke up on the ceilin'
Party at the roof, off the hook
Got every drug up in the book
You don't believe me
See for yourself and take a closer look
Low rider car shows
Hoppin' till the truck blows
Catch me at the bar
Havin' a drink with my uncles
Pacifico with no lime
That's what I drink at all times
Creased up Davis', I'm always out like where the pavement is
I come from the underground
The underground like where the basement is
It's California, people have a hard time facin' it

I was raised in the streets of California
(Southern California, home of car-hoppin' and bomb-droppin'
West coast pop lockin', walkin' how we're talkin')
I was raised in the streets of California
(I was raised in Californ-I-A
Where homeboys die everyday over some shit they say)

Low rider bicycles, tricycles
Cold as icicles
Smokin' chronic shit
So high, you would think my eyes are closed
I got my eyes on those
Who be thinkin' that my eyes are closed
But there not ese
Trucha when you get too close
You'll know, that I know
What you think, I don't know
I might explode, unload
Reload, and unload
You broke the code, you gots to go
Ain't no future in your frontin'
Crazy California homeboy
Where the cuete's bustin'
California stylin', California ridin'
Whittier Boulevard to 'Frisco
Then back to Highland
I gots to do it like the locos do
Don't race your ride
Hop your ride like you're supposed to do, through

Lil Rob,"Love problems Money and drug problems
That's all some shit that brings you down

My life couldn't get worse, I wake up with a curse
It's like, fuck, I woke up
Me and my chick just broke up, and I was broke up
I just lost trust for people all around me
Not just friends, not just acquaintances, but also family
And it's sad to see family be like an enemy would be
You're no longer family, now you're just an enemy to me
Don't speak to me, I'm high
Not high enough to not feel the pain
Of being betrayed, played, portrayed for a fool
That shit ain't cool, we ain't in school
I quit school because of the playground
Now my homeboys that have been down and stayed down
Well now they get around
They do what they do, do what they did, had kids
And that's all good though
It's not their fault I'm all alone, in my lonely little hood Holmes
Behind the smile theres a frown, sad enough to bring you down
Hey there Ms. Brown, I'm feelin' down
Hey there Ms. Brown, I want you 'round

Hey there Ms. Brown
I want you round
I'm feelin' down
Hey there Ms. Brown
I need you round
I'm feelin' down

I see you kickin back with the homies all the time
And I wanna try you, what would you do to, me
Is it true what they say, you could take my pain away
Leave me with nothing but sunny days, and take my rain away
Right away, what am I missing, how could I miss something I never had
Are you, really that bad, don't even know you, but I want you so bad
Guaranteed to make me feel good, I wish you would
Should I introduce myself to Ms. Brown, I think I should
Mucho gusto, such a sweet love
Sweet like chocolate, make me feel higher, than weed does
She does things to me, that make me see things, in a whole new way
I'd pay any price to feel this nice
You're priceless, make my life timeless
Thank you for your kindness
I just, can't get enough of you
You're so addictive, and I'm so addicted
Hey there Ms. Brown
I need you 'round

[Chorus]

I'm tryin' to say I'm not perfect, you see we all make mistakes
I'm far from perfect, my heart aches, my heart breaks
Wish it didn't, but it does
Wish it wasn't, but it was
Try to look you, in the eye
But I can't see, through the fuzz
It's cuz of this, it's come to this, the, loneliest loneliness
I thought two times, when my primo told me this
He said, slowly she becomes you, 'till you become her
Then your life becomes a blur and you forget who you were
I guess he's right, I look in the mirror and I don't know who I am
I'm lost, don't even know what direction I'm in
Hey there Ms. Brown, come paint a pretty picture again
I'm feelin' down, Ms. Brown make me feel better again I'd like to thank you for your, kindness
I just, can't get enough of you
You're so addictive, and I'm so addicted
Hey there Ms. Brown, I'm feelin' down I need you 'round

Lil Rob,"Yeah 
I used to ride my bicicleta 
Down the calles of my town 
Oldies everyday,thats the way it was 
Those were the days, the crazy ones 
A lot people died that summer 
Its a bummer but shit happens 
Or rob them in a day and see ambullences from a distance 
A place where you'd find seringes 
And the drug use was tremendous 
Some say my town was surrendous 
Until the drug use was off the hinges 
My boarder brothers would have to run fast, dash 
And hop the fences 
Dont take that out of content homeboy, 
Cus we're all gente through my lentes 
But the migra would creep down, and sweep hard 
And take them all back to tj if they didnt have the green card 
The parke was the spot, it was hot 
And it was dealin in the street 
The heroine was a killer homeboy 
It had seven killings in a week 
It was a bad bash but they still had to have that, 
So it didnt stop me 
I'd come to the pad 
And sells all the merchandise til the jura cought'em 
We used to get shit for cheap homes, like 90% off 
Give homie a little feria for his fix 
And then he sped off

[Chorus]
I was brought up, (i was brought up) 
In a rough neighborhood, (in a rough neighborhood) 
Where you learn more in the streets, (where the shit goes down homes) 
Than you learn in school 

I was brought up, (i was brought up) 
In a rough neighborhood, (in a rough neighborhood) 
Where you learn more in the streets,(where you don't fuck around homes) 
Than you learn in school

It was cool walking to school 
See the vatos and the gatos itchin and twitchin, scratchin 
Havin a conversation with satin 
On the good one (on the good trip) 
I mean loaded off some good shit 
You might not believe it 
But ey homes this aint no bullshit 
My town was all brown man, 
The gente and the drogas 
People walking around fucked up, druged up, lookin all sucked up 
But thats where I was brought up 
Where a lot of people shot up 
Got caught up and locked up 
Its not just sumthin that I thought up 
It was somthing that was happenin 
And I seen it with my own eyes eh 
La colonia, eden gardens californ I a 
Got a little older 
And my blood got a little colder 
Started taggin up my plaquaso up on my barrio 
Up on my folder 
Me and homeboys we would walk the calles 
Lookin like soldiers 
With the chip on their shoulders 
The size of bolders,little lokesters 
Down to get down with the next town when they came around 
We be throwin chicasos, 
We be spittin balazos 

[Chorus]

I was brought up, (i was brought up) 
In a rough neighborhood, (in a rough neighborhood) 
Where you learn more in the streets,(where you dont fuck around homes) 
Than you learn in school

It wasn't long before I got mine 
See I got shot at the stop sign 
Took a bala to the boca 
Got blood all over my ropa 
I lost a couple of homies 
I got some friends up in the pin 
But when they get out 
It seems like they go right back in again 
It all started out with crazy situations 
Juvinall hall and probation 
Then get busted for violation 
That leaves a lifetime incarcaration 
But my town went through some changes 
One thing will never change 
It made me who I am 
And I remain to stay the same

[Chorus]
I was brought up, (I was brought up) 
In a rough neighborhood, (in a rough neighborhood) 
Where you learn more in the streets, (where the shit goes down homes) 
Than you learn in school 

I was brought up, (i was brought up) 
In a rough neighborhood, (in a rough neighborhood) 
Where you learn more in the streets,(where you don't fuck around homes) 
Than you learn in school",Rough Neighborhood
Lil Rob,"I'm feeling good, feeling all right tonight
I'm feeling good now, Its all good in the neighborhood homes
Lil Rob
I feel good, I feel all right
Cruising through the neighborhood on a warm summer night
I feel good
That's right
I feel good now, summer nights

Summer days just sitting around but when the sun goes down
I'll be ready to party
(Par-ty)
Ain't nothing like them summer nights
Keep the top on drop while the girls looking hot,
Hit the volo and we just don't stop
Party until the morning light
(Par-ty)
Ain't nothing like them summer nights

I just kicked it at home, I polished up the chrome
Call the ruca on the phone, let her know I'm home alone, Its
Seven thirty and the sun is going down, Its a
Summer night and the fun is going down
I picked her up and she looks all dolled up (She looks good)
Sitting passenger in my rag impala (yeah)
I let her know she looks beautiful to me
The world is an ugly place but she's such a site to see
The kind of woman that would put up a fight for me
The kind that wants to spend summer nights with me
The temp was eighty and I'm cruising with my lady
Playing some Ralphie Pagan, ""Oh Baby Baby""
I see my home boys and they're cruising in their rides (Hey was up homes)
With their ladies sitting by their side
People think we look crazy, but I think we look classy
But then again that's only if you ask me


Summer days just sitting around but when the sun goes down
I'll be ready to party
(Par-ty)
Ain't nothing like them summer nights
Keep the top on drop while the girls looking hot,
Hit the volo and we just don't stop
Party until the morning light
(Par-ty)
Ain't nothing like them summer nights

My homeboys throwing a back yard boogie,
So every body gets together to unwind, relax and have a fun time
The DJ is spinning so I grab the mic and be like
Ain't nothing like them summer nights
The party is packed with beautiful woman and
A gang of the homies that want to get with them
And they'll say anything just to hit em
And its usually a nice summer night when they did em
I don't know, it must be something in the air
Can't help but have a good time, because the feeling is there
To some people the feeling is rare
They're at the pad saying God dam I wish I was there
To have a drink, have a tok and hook up
With some one fine but the kind that looks up
Got to keep some pisto in the cup
Party until the sun comes up or we give up

Summer days just sitting around but when the sun goes down
I'll be ready to party
(Par-ty)
Ain't nothing like them summer nights
Keep the top on drop while the girls looking hot,
Hit the volo and we just don't stop
Party until the morning light
(Par-ty)
Ain't nothing like them summer nights

Them summer nights can keep a smile on your face
Gotta try to have a good time with your life otherwise it's just a waste
Either way I'm gonna party just in case
Like prince partied like it was 99, in 87, 88
I couldn't ask for no better weather, I'm right next to the Pacific to be specific
The candy paint job glows under the moon light
As I close out my summer night and say good night
Its time to put the top up and park it, drop it
Unplug the ground, roll up the windows and lock it
Walk into the pad and fall into bed
As she lays on my chest to rest her sleepy head
And we do this all night long
From dust til dawn
But its not the quite the same when summer nights are gone
But even when they're gone, it won't be long
Eight more months and once again its on

Summer days just sitting around but when the sun goes down
I'll be ready to party
(Par-ty)
Ain't nothing like them summer nights
Keep the top on drop while the girls looking hot,
Hit the volo and we just don't stop
Party until the morning light
(Par-ty)
Ain't nothing like them summer nights",Summer Nights
Lil Rob,"Ese Lil Rob
We go through them hard times man
Just gotta keep our heads up
Keep on walking

[Chorus]
These Cortez Shoes know all the hard times that we had been through
All the crazy things we used to do just to get by walk in my shoes and you
Will see why these cortez shoes try n walk in these cortez shoes betcha could'nt
Walk in a mile in these shoes but we get by and we got to keep on walking

Let me take you back a way homie back in my day before that I figured
Out that crime doesn't pay I was ont the streets every night and everyday out with
The homies hanging out having a good time hey but sometimes a good time ended up
Jump in a ride and go blast on the vatos from the other side my uncles did it my
Brother did it and now so do I no need to wonder why I was a victim of a drive
By it turned into a shoot out but they ain't getting away hell no not with out a bullet
Wound ay that was my state of mind all the time don't cross the line and believe me
When I say that the line was fine you might catch me in a bad mood with a bad
Attitude a lil homeboy who hates to loose or you could be talking shit about me right
Now but you could'nt walk a mile in my shoes ya feel me homes come on

[Chorus]

My homeboy called me up said turn on the TV that's when I got the news
Of my homeboy peewee rest in peace to the deceased beneath the barrio streets
When I saw him on the news he had cortez on his feet we went through it some of
Us made it some of us blew it who would of knew it I remember crazy times in the

Buick crazy shit we were likely to do it I wasn't really serious about music it's just to
Easy to loose it and a lot of us do it itchy finger on the trigger easy to pull it we live
Our life by the bullet we either die or get locked up make a mess to big to be
Mopped up behind the smile there's a frown sad enough to bring you down a lil
Homeboy who sings the blues because he had no clue what to do in his life walking
Around in his cortez shoes that's what I used to do

[Chorus]

I got shot down the block at the spot ran from cops never thought it
Would stop never hit the county or Juvenal hall but that's only cause I didn't get caught
An I can only imagine what would of happened if I continued scrapping n capping
Blasting an laughing I'll prolly be dead or in jail then I wouldn't be standing here rapping
About my cortez shoes

Gotta make moves quick
If you snooze then you lose it
Lay you down like my cheverlet
After a day of play
After i juice it
Get stupid
Hit the corner crooked
Don't remember how i took it
Don't remember how i made it
I remember being faded
Remember when i had more than anticipated
Got intoxicated
I almost got incarcirated
Put my petal to the metal
Hear me screechin' down the pavement
I'm messy lil rob
And I'm back up on the block
In a rag top with a back drop not knowin' when to stop
So i'ma keep on rollin' till the wheels are fallin' off
And it might get a little crazy but nobody call the cops
We got it under control
We're on a gangsta stroll
Watchin' out for the pigs on patrol
'Cause my homboys on parole
My little homboys on probation
Still gots a chance to change his life
But right now its incarciration that he's facin'

If i could turn back i would slow it down
If i could go back i would do it again

See homboy vato down the block 
He told me vato got shot
In the parking lot of the taco shop
The towns been hot
Been full of cops 
Been full of blacas
I told them i don't really understand it homie
Bumpin' this is for la raza
Hit the switch like this
Its your big end of the street
Where i keep my cuete under my seat
Where i keep on the creep
Where we go to the grave with the secrets we keep
And i'ma always keep my word so that i'm able to sleep
I'm bumpin' the beat when i heard her body talkin' to me
I like what its sayin' and i love what i see
You're comin' with me
Her body's cold and comfortable the whole
So magicly now she's sittin' in my passenger seat
We got it under control
We rollin' low
It's so slow i 
Hit the land yo and live my life in slow mo
If i could do this one more
Time again just tell me when so i can do it again

Slow it down
If i could go back i would slow it down
If i could turn back i would slow it down
If i could go back i would do it again
Do it again
Do, do, do it again

See one of my homboys he's doin' good
He started life over
Another homboy not so good
He slid now life's over
He was supposed to be gettin' married
In february
Now he's in the coffin being carried at the cemetary
Getting burried
Take a hit of the joint and keep it cherry
'Cause this shit is gettin' heavy
Like the chevy on 5 twentys
And that's pretty heavy
Tryna make that pretty penny
Where there's plenty
And i'll be damned if i ain't makin' any
Comin' out stronger than many
Many bolder than most
We get sick with it
Sicker than my flows; fuckin' gross
The products was where i was brought up
It's the bomb like a feline
Tag my name on a street sign
Throwin' up the peace sign
Lookin' for a feline
That's bad enough to be mine
Fuck ya homboy; she fine
So we gon' keep on rollin'

I could spend all day watching you
Girl I'm just a man I'm not stalkin' you
I've had many conversations with many women
But for some reason I can't talk to you
You don't wanna hear them lies
Sure it happens a lot
You probably hear them all the time
But I bullshit you not I like you a lot
And I just really wanna be on your mind
Maybe I can head to your spot
And pick you up around seven o' clock
And we can do whatever you want, however you like
And we don't ever have to stop
Your smile brightens up a room
And I don't think I ever get enough of you
But I just really wanna fuck with you
And I really wouldn't mind being stuck with you

And there ain't nothing that I won't do
I'll do anything you ask me to

And I don't wanna move too fast
Fool around, Fall in love and crash
But anytime with you would be worth it
A lifetime with you would be perfect
You're beautiful and intelligent too
The last thing you need is an arrogant foo
Who don't know how to treat someone like you
It's lucky for you that I do
Hey don't let no one get you down
Not even me but I won't let you down
Smiles on my face when you come around
But when you leave it turns upside down
You could be my confessions to my expressions
My expressions will answer any questions
I only have eyes for you
I only want you and I won't except no exceptions

[Chorus]

And there ain't nothing that I won't do
I'll pull a star from the sky for you
if you ask me to
I wanna be more than just your friend
ill only stop to start again
If I could talk to you what would you say
What are the chances you feel the same way
Would you say you're in love with me
And that you want nothing more than to be stuck with me
God just let me know

So what you say girl
Just tell me what to do

I don't wanna fall in love
'Cause every time I fall
I learn that love don't love nobody
At all

I don't wanna fall in love no more, that word is for the birds
How else can I say it, hmm, that word is to the curb
Absurd, overrated, and I hate it, don't want it
Don't need it, won't happen, believe it, I seen it
And I've heard it
Just when I thought that everything was perfect
She with my best friend getting perverted
Like I deserved it
I started cursin', turning into a different person
Had to evaluate the situation
And not let it worsen
At least that's my version
I'm the one who got the hurtin'
That's for certain, now it's curtains and I'll never love the same way twice
'Cause it ain't nothin' nice, and never ends up right
I feel sorry for all those who are in life

I know you say you love me
But baby, no you don't
I know you think you do now

Hey, he shot me first
And it was cool at first, until she found that other guy
And then, it hurt
What the heck is that about, I regret the day I asked her out
Gotta make a brand new plan cause this one isn't pannin' out
If love is in my path, then I'm a have to take a different route

She knows she's bad
Yeah she knows she's bad
Bad as a murderer

She got her own crib
She got her own wheel
She got her own crew
So she takes own true
She got own s way
She buy her own bed
And when she hit the mall
She's Papa

And she's so pretty
She don't need no nigger
And when she's in the club
She buys her own liquor
I mean a whole bottle
Nigger like him
She looks just like a diva
If she wasn't scared
I guess he will be up to meet her
You know what she says
Money ain't a thing
And when she takes you up
She'll eat you whole thing

She got her own crib
She got her own wheel
She got her own crew
So she takes own true
She got own s way
She buy her own bed
And when she hit the mall
She's Papa

She's bad and she has a nice way
She hit the mall
A Louis bag, she got that
The Gucci bag, she got that
Yeah she got that this because she bought that
She hit the true club and makes that ass pop
Every time I see her I tell her that's her
I see my like her
I tell her she can pop inside my yellow Jaguar
And you know I got like a bad boy
All across the world
Grab your passport
You ain't got to ask

She got her own crib
She got her own wheel
She got her own crew
So she takes own true
She got own s way
She buy her own bed
And when she hit the mall
She's Papa

If she's so fine
I wanna fuck her five times
Got a lot of boobs but they are on the side line
What I wanna do to you baby should be a crime
She said
She saw your ID
She ain't be no one night hore
She only be the only shit
I like this shit",Bad (That's Her)
Lil Scrappy,"[Chorus: x2]
If you a thug my nigga be a thug
If you sell drugs my nigga then sell drugs
If you gonna rap about it be trill about it
And don't say shit if you can't BE REAL about it

Comin' up as a child my city was hell
My moma was the best soldier, dad stayed in out of jail
I came robbin' and kickin' in doors then on my behalf and 17 old
But ya see shorty, My mom was a G
She made it real easy for my sista and me
She did what she had to do, 
And got out the damn crowd like a nigga would do
Talkin' about pimpin', o she did that too
I got robbed and this old nigga took all my loot
And I was just twelve years old on thirteen skin and bones 
That's why I thank my heart to sell dope
I gives a fuck about none of you hoes
All you fake thugs think about is grills and gold, 
And pressin' these doors
(shorty) and cakin these hoes
I'ma pimp, I spend my time makin' these hoes

[Chorus]

Nobody loves me so I guess I stay to myself
A nigga thinkin' bout change contemplating my death
Fell my pain as it reigns all over a nigga
And the only way I can get away is weed and liquor
Fuckin' niggas up on the daily if they didn't pay me
Niggas pullin' guns on me damn near drove me crazy
Young nigga went to school just to sell some dope
A lil' crazy ass nigga wit a knife in his coat
And in the streets broke heathens went through drama especially
Moma swung on a nigga, I stabbed the bitch in her head (nigga)
I dun scratch my head unless it itchs
An I dun smoke unless I'm bustin' at you hatin' bitches
Nigga we was brave to die, don't be askin' me why
Ill rather hustle in the cold 'cause niggas sprayin' wit' fire
All the childhood fixin's wit tha devil inside the kitchen
Got my mind on my gun and I'm finna pull a pistol

You see the streets, 
They'll shallow you whole, mind body and soul
And leave you in a ditch wit no shoes and clothes
Waitin' for the trash collector
Follow me mind selector to the ghetto sector
They'll kill you over thirty dollars
I seen a man cut wit a dirty bottle blood squirted on his shirt and collar
I heard him holla a sound that I can't forget
Ran home, watched cartoons and ain't said shit
And to this day moma thought I was young, hungry, and poor (par)
While she was at the church praising the lord
I made through amazingly unscarred
She had to be praying 'cause I made it by the grace of the god
I'm proud of my hard times, I spit hard rhymes
Bible in one hand, the other hand nine
Dreaming of naming streets and boulevards mine
Grab yo piece of the pie, the other parts mine

We gotta lotta money,
Come on we didn't have to hurt em' like
Dis 50, well anyway, g-unit!

[Chorus: x4]
I got money in the bank (yea)
Shawty what you drank

Nobody loves me so I guess I stay to myself
A nigga thinkin' bout change contemplating my death
Fell my pain as it reigns all over a nigga
And the only way I can get away is weed and liquor
Fuckin' niggas up on the daily if they didn't pay me
Niggas pullin' guns on me damn near drove me crazy
Young nigga went to school just to sell some dope
A lil' crazy ass nigga wit a knife in his coat
And in the streets broke heathens went through drama especially
Momma swung on a nigga, I stabbed the bitch in her head (nigga)
I dun scratch my head unless it itchs
An I dun smoke unless I'm bustin' at you hatin' bitches
Nigga we was brave to die, dont be askin me why
Ill rather hustle in the cold 'cause niggas sprayin' wit' fire
All the childhood fixin's wit' tha devil inside the kitchen
Got my mind on my gun and I'm finna pull a pistol

[Chorus: x4]

Flippin' Benz, bubble-lens, feed ya tank a number ten
If ya pimpin', her and friends, I ain't trippin' get ya ins
If ya been, in the pen', pop this in and lift ya chin
Tat skin, get some ins, and throw some glitter in ya grin
Man, once again, but this dank off in the wind
If you don't smoke, then that's for them, put some drank off in ya chin
Remember back about 10, majors wouldn't let us in
Servin' school is a lifestyle, but they treat it like it's a trend
Man, they like ""koopa tell me where the hell you been""
Man, I been dealin' with family, and takin' care of ben
Franklin, ain't the end, I was here when it begin
See if ya ridin' davin rims, celebrate by lettin' em' spin
I bought some new ones in, to replace the older rims
What type of rims? that depends is it the truck, the bike, or van
Had to hop out, and stop my spinners on the rims
My alarm kept detecting motion pokin' out of them
Man, I'm just sayin', y'all know koopa don't be playin'
I'm just sayin', I be layin' with the flat tv's displayin'
Sometimes I feel like grippin', sometimes I'm tippin'
Niggas in the streets tryin' to find out if it's written
Haha, yo, chamillitary man!

[Chorus: x4]

I still remember them nights under the street lights
Fiends don't give a damn, they want who got the cheap price
I'm trying to get right, get it and go
You see people is dyin' fast, and the money is slow
We used to hang in front of the store
Flag down cars to be a movie star, go get a glass jar
Once you cook it and cut it homie, go stand out in public
See the work sell's itself, if ya got enough of it
Plenty thugs get shot, but see its all in the game
Even I took a couple of 'em, but still I remain
I ain't dippin' from that same lead project figga
I done went with no lights, and no water nigga
And I'm still hood, that mean I still cook
Get on the block and go get mine, like you should
How can I be good? when rappers wanna be Suge
Suroundin' myself with family, so I can sleep good

[Chorus: x4]

You know tha kid stay with his Nike's new, tha throwback is light blue
Came out around the time, my grandmother graduated high school
Most these rap niggas softer than Ja Rule
And they've been in and out as many walkmans as I do
Take time, to figure out who's walkin' beside you
Cause this sonic can feel like a fork when inside you
You mad, cause ya bitch like us
And all of my records get thumbs up, like I'm ridin' by hitchikers
Stumblin' out the g4, cause that's how tha stars land
Shit I prolly been through more trees than tarzan
On tha road, tha hoes take a look at tha cars and
It's back tha hotel, titties and bras man
Tha new ""strap don""
You might call me ignorant, but if you cow you belong in tha phat farm
When tha lights get bigger I act calm
Prolly cause I'm a light skinned nigga with black arms (fucka!)

[Chorus: x4]

I'm ridin' on 22's
Youze a rewinder
Motherfuckers suck me
Then I fuck them back nigga
Now what you do em'
Give it to me baby, nice and slow
Climb on top, ride like you in the rodeo
You ain't never heard a sound like this before
Cause I ain't never put it down like this
Soon as I come through the door she get to pullin' on my zipper
It's like it's a race who can get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic how erotic it is to watch em in thongs
Had me thinking 'bout that ass after I'm gone
I touch the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she winds
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind
As long as she ain't stoppin', homie I ain't stoppin'
Drippin' wet with sweat man its on and popping
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle its on
And we gon' sip til every bubble in the bottle is gone

[Chorus: x4]

Yo nowadays niggas talk like they wanna get shot
Like I won't grab the glock and run up in your spot
Six double o drop I'll put two in your knot
And stick around and get every motherfucking thing you've got
Here I stand on the alley on godrule
Same spot where rob got shot
The block's high
Warrant squad flashing my mug shot
Everybody know I'm loco, kill the popo, blast the fo fo, rode dolo
Rock solo, I should be old t on the low yo
Pump the six and push the volvo
I hear they go kuku and go puff loco
I sell llelo and price up and down like yo yo
But keep that on the low do, nobody's supposed to know, yo
I make 16 hundred off of every ho do
Fucking with the cash flow that'll get you blast yo (haha)
I always get the last laugh yo

But I'm gonna tell you like this, I don't play no games
I was built for this shit and I can take the pain!
Through my whole life course I've been off the chain
And niggas knew I been broke way before the fame!
I been havin' crazy thoughts, of murder a nigga
Ooh, I wish a nigga would! I don't take that shit!
If a lot of talkers are less, walkers that's rich!
My momma taught me to hit every nigga that act like a bitch. (aye!)

Motherfucker didn't know I was gonna go crazy over here

I'm back, hotter than a nigga in hell
I'm back, know you sick so I'm wishin' you well
I'm back, grindin' hot and tuck in yo' tail
I'm back, soon as I hit da crowd gon' yell

I'm back, know you sick so I'm wishin' you well
I'm back, grindin' hot and tuck in yo' tail
I'm back, soon as I hit da crowd gon' yell, well I'm back

Click clack, tha prince is back
Even tho I been here I still owe y'all that
A nigga been low key, but I'm off da rack
Just off da corner sold weed, now I'm back to crack

Had to get some new bullets and some even bigger guns
Movin' in and out of traffic like I'm still on the run
Got my vest on shawty and I'm strappin' a ton
Ev'rythang all good 'cause I'm fuckin' with Jon

That's where, a nigga straight fell to the airport
Bought 2 first class seats to New York
To see if I could go and ball in the same coat
Me and my bitch both, two guns we tot

A nigga was weak, now the goon is woke
Ain't even no question about the nines I roll
Got hit with a bottle and I still got flow
BME and G-unit, that's all she wrote

I'm back, hotter than a nigga in hell
I'm back, know you sick so I'm wishin' you well

On behalf of the first verse, ya know I'm coming
Still deep in the club with my niggas thumpin'
Every show I do, ya know I have um' screaming and jumpin'
Ya niggas still hatin' but ya know they be poppin',

Through the course of this album, ya your boy dun went through it
Like getting pushed off the stage by the police station
I dunno what the hell wrong with all these pigs
Another police touch me and I'm gonna sue him again

He might have been broke, I gotta raise these kids
I don't think some of y'all know what you're playin' with
Had a sick manager who took my benefit
Fuckin' with violator now that picture look real big

On some real shit, my nigga Vic gon' be rich
Pray to God forgive him for the dirt that he did
When I wasn't on TV you forgot about me
I took it upon myself to remind you 'bout me

I'm back, hotter than a nigga in hell
I'm back, know you sick so I'm wishin' you well
I'm back, grindin' hot and tuck in yo' tail
I'm back, soon as I hit da crowd gon' yell

Ey, ya know what it is man, G's up, get yo' cheese up, ey
It's ya boy, Lil' Scrap, don't nobody really know my struggle
But they wanna be, where I'm at
Well go through the pain, nigga 'cause only the good Lord know, yup

Have a bitch on the passenger side like me
Yeah, I think they wanna shine like me
On TV with the fame like me

Yeah, they wanna wear a chain like me
I think they wanna be trained like me
Yeah, they wanna have the game like me
But don't wanna go through pain like me

I know you see me shining with the yellow diamond
Don't be thinkin' that ya boy ain't been grinding
I was with my momma and there was a lotta drama
We sold crack from the winter all through the summer

Yeah, we went through pain, we was stacking change
Paying the cost to live in the streets mayne
Sold cocaine just a little powder
Sellin' weed tryna make a couple of extra dollars

The shit I been through a nigga should've been a scholar
All night tryna sleep hearing pistols hollar, damn
Now when your plannin' to die, you know a nigga cried
Not having him around, you know it hurt inside

Gotta have shelter over my lil' sister
Momma wondering around 'cause she a drug dealer
I gotta give it to her 'cause she a real nigga
I kill any mo'focker doing something to her, yup

I think they wanna ride like me
Have a bitch on the passenger side like me
Yeah, I think they wanna shine like me
On TV with the fame like me

Yeah, they wanna wear a chain like me
I think they wanna be trained like me
Yeah, they wanna have the game like me
But don't wanna go through pain like me

They wanna be on stage right, they wanna get paid
But they don't know the hurt and they can't feel my pain
On stage gettin' hit with a bottle
Knocked out and I need to know if I'mma rap tomorrow

In the hospital straight bruised up
Got a cut from my lip and my thumbs up, damn
It's kind of fucked up, 'cause I waz showin' love
I was givin' hugs, chillin' with the thugs

Al I'm tryna do is show love to everybody
God let me alive so I can tell about it, Amen
See I don't scream and shout it, but I go to church
What ya know about puttin' in that brown work

They throwin' up signs and they dyin' for it, I'm crip and a blood
Niggaz taking lives goin' to jail payin' for it
Ain't nothing left after death but heaven itself
And if ya go to jail your seed will have no help

I think they wanna ride like me
Have a bitch on the passenger side like me
Yeah, I think they wanna shine like me
On TV with the fame like me

Yeah, they wanna wear a chain like me
I think they wanna be trained like me
Yeah, they wanna have the game like me

And You can forgive me for all my sins

G's up it's a G thang
Y'all motherfuckers know me mayne
G's up it's a G thang near me

Lord have mercy on me, heard nigga say there's a heaven for a G
If there is please save a spot for me, I don't want to burn
I hit a nigga up before a nigga hit me, ridin' around with my strap on me
Just in case a nigga wanna fucking clap me, I don't wanna burn, no no

Dear Lord, it's a letter to You
A young nigga hurtin' and I don't know what to do
I try to live life right but these cowards be hatin'
It's like every where I go I run into the same

I'm on this earth with my blessings and my curse
Just thinking how we live threw riddin' the hearse
Even though You know me ever since I was birth
I'm innocent till You judge me and that comes first

And I ain't tryin' to burn Lord 'cause that's the worst
Forgive me for backsliding, I only rob for the thirst
I knew it was wrong that I was snatching her purse
But it was cold outside I couldn't afford a shirt

Yeah, I wanna go to church but I can't be faithful
I'm always doin' shows but You know that I'm great full
I churn wheat for the fruit 'cause it be tasteful
I don't know in the world how I could ever repay You

Lord have mercy on me, heard nigga say there's a heaven for a G
If there is please save a spot for me, I don't want to burn
I hit a nigga up before a nigga hit me, ridin' around with my strap on me
Just in case a nigga wanna fucking clap me, I don't wanna burn, no no

Aye Chris, can you sit your ass down my nigga?
Damn a man can't even write to God

Dear Lord, I thank You for lookin' out for my fam
Havin' my lil' brother who don't give a damn
You see my lil' sista done got pregnant
And my momma actin' crazy and ain't changin'

And I pray that You keep my pops preachin'
'Cause if he ain't around there's no body teachin'
And please keep my baby momma from being a bitch
Excuse my language Lord but it's always friction

I wanna thank You for blessing me with my little girl
But please give me the power to fight the whole world
'Cause I swear on You if they touch my kid
I'ma be sitting down writing You again

Lord have mercy on me, heard nigga say there's a heaven for a G
If there is please save a spot for me, I don't want to burn
I hit a nigga up before a nigga hit me, ridin' around with my strap on me
Just in case a nigga wanna fucking clap me, I don't wanna burn, no no

Lil Scrappy,"Remix,
We gotta lotta money,
Come on we didn't have to hurt em' like
Dis 50, well anyway, g-unit!

[Chorus: x4]
I got money in the bank (yea)
Shawty what you drank

Nobody loves me so I guess I stay to myself
A nigga thinkin' bout change contemplating my death
Fell my pain as it reigns all over a nigga
And the only way I can get away is weed and liquor
Fuckin' niggas up on the daily if they didn't pay me
Niggas pullin' guns on me damn near drove me crazy
Young nigga went to school just to sell some dope
A lil' crazy ass nigga wit a knife in his coat
And in the streets broke heathens went through drama especially
Momma swung on a nigga, I stabbed the bitch in her head (nigga)
I dun scratch my head unless it itchs
An I dun smoke unless I'm bustin' at you hatin' bitches
Nigga we was brave to die, dont be askin me why
Ill rather hustle in the cold 'cause niggas sprayin' wit' fire
All the childhood fixin's wit' tha devil inside the kitchen
Got my mind on my gun and I'm finna pull a pistol

[Chorus: x4]

Flippin' Benz, bubble-lens, feed ya tank a number ten
If ya pimpin', her and friends, I ain't trippin' get ya ins
If ya been, in the pen', pop this in and lift ya chin
Tat skin, get some ins, and throw some glitter in ya grin
Man, once again, but this dank off in the wind
If you don't smoke, then that's for them, put some drank off in ya chin
Remember back about 10, majors wouldn't let us in
Servin' school is a lifestyle, but they treat it like it's a trend
Man, they like ""koopa tell me where the hell you been""
Man, I been dealin' with family, and takin' care of ben
Franklin, ain't the end, I was here when it begin
See if ya ridin' davin rims, celebrate by lettin' em' spin
I bought some new ones in, to replace the older rims
What type of rims? that depends is it the truck, the bike, or van
Had to hop out, and stop my spinners on the rims
My alarm kept detecting motion pokin' out of them
Man, I'm just sayin', y'all know koopa don't be playin'
I'm just sayin', I be layin' with the flat tv's displayin'
Sometimes I feel like grippin', sometimes I'm tippin'
Niggas in the streets tryin' to find out if it's written
Haha, yo, chamillitary man!

[Chorus: x4]

I still remember them nights under the street lights
Fiends don't give a damn, they want who got the cheap price
I'm trying to get right, get it and go
You see people is dyin' fast, and the money is slow
We used to hang in front of the store
Flag down cars to be a movie star, go get a glass jar
Once you cook it and cut it homie, go stand out in public
See the work sell's itself, if ya got enough of it
Plenty thugs get shot, but see its all in the game
Even I took a couple of 'em, but still I remain
I ain't dippin' from that same lead project figga
I done went with no lights, and no water nigga
And I'm still hood, that mean I still cook
Get on the block and go get mine, like you should
How can I be good? when rappers wanna be Suge
Suroundin' myself with family, so I can sleep good

[Chorus: x4]

You know tha kid stay with his Nike's new, tha throwback is light blue
Came out around the time, my grandmother graduated high school
Most these rap niggas softer than Ja Rule
And they've been in and out as many walkmans as I do
Take time, to figure out who's walkin' beside you
Cause this sonic can feel like a fork when inside you
You mad, cause ya bitch like us
And all of my records get thumbs up, like I'm ridin' by hitchikers
Stumblin' out the g4, cause that's how tha stars land
Shit I prolly been through more trees than tarzan
On tha road, tha hoes take a look at tha cars and
It's back tha hotel, titties and bras man
Tha new ""strap don""
You might call me ignorant, but if you cow you belong in tha phat farm
When tha lights get bigger I act calm
Prolly cause I'm a light skinned nigga with black arms (fucka!)

[Chorus: x4]

I'm ridin' on 22's
Youze a rewinder
Motherfuckers suck me
Then I fuck them back nigga
Now what you do em'
Give it to me baby, nice and slow
Climb on top, ride like you in the rodeo
You ain't never heard a sound like this before
Cause I ain't never put it down like this
Soon as I come through the door she get to pullin' on my zipper
It's like it's a race who can get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic how erotic it is to watch em in thongs
Had me thinking 'bout that ass after I'm gone
I touch the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she winds
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind
As long as she ain't stoppin', homie I ain't stoppin'
Drippin' wet with sweat man its on and popping
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle its on
And we gon' sip til every bubble in the bottle is gone

[Chorus: x4]

Yo nowadays niggas talk like they wanna get shot
Like I won't grab the glock and run up in your spot
Six double o drop I'll put two in your knot
And stick around and get every motherfucking thing you've got
Here I stand on the alley on godrule
Same spot where rob got shot
The block's high
Warrant squad flashing my mug shot
Everybody know I'm loco, kill the popo, blast the fo fo, rode dolo
Rock solo, I should be old t on the low yo
Pump the six and push the volvo
I hear they go kuku and go puff loco
I sell llelo and price up and down like yo yo
But keep that on the low do, nobody's supposed to know, yo
I make 16 hundred off of every ho do
Fucking with the cash flow that'll get you blast yo (haha)
I always get the last laugh yo

Wow, bitch I got

They say life is like a circus when you stuck on the block
So we don't snitch and eat pork, we don't fuck with the cops
And that's why I'll be gettin paper til the day that I die
So like Monica Lewinsky, keep your head up high... 'cause

It's the son of the preacher, but raised by the dope lady
Talkin get money, pimp hard so niggas gon hate me
I got a good heart, and a good brain
You heard my gangsta story, my life was off the chain
My momma flipped the cane, and pop was up at church
The Joe had me in the hallway with the purp
Prayin that I stay safe and I don't get murked
But I bet I get paid, make that money work
Hittin garages, I bet I got a nigga vert
Let me holla at ya bitch, I'll make dat pussy hurt (yea)

Lil Scrappy,"Yeah, ah, so we fighting, fucking then we loving
In the AM baby we'll be nothing
And you say you like that real thugging
But you hate it when them ? cuffin
Confused flow, for real though
Love came through the front, went out the back door
Emotions are running, depression is coming
Can't believe you love me, cause your feelings are funny

[Chorus: x2]
I'm so tired of going up and down, round and round
I'm so over it, I'm breaking down
I'm bout to call it quits, I done had enough of it
My heart is so cold, I can't find no love here

My heart on broken, confidence stolen
Mind going crazy, should I stay or keep going
She don't love me, well I gotta embrace it
If I don't love her, baby girl you gotta face it
The thang about love you can't find it you neither trace it
If love was a test, you either fail or you ace it
Love me, for who I am
If not, shit I don't give a damn
You want the cars, house and designer things
I get it baby girl, you want the finer things
And I ain't hatin on you, go and get it now
Matter fact, go and get it Now, matter fact make daddy proud
Everything change when you say the L word
Cause I can't say it back I don't know what to tell her
I can't find no love here
You say what is love, it's a powerful word
And it's more than great, man that shit can hurt

Got a lot of hard feelings, wall up
Barred up, caught up, start up
Don't wanna fall cause
I can't let another one in

[Chorus: x2]

Live on the web, we're shooting up the celebs
And I'm goin' through hell, wanna release a couple shells
You wanna upgrade baby and that's a fact
But you don't get a nigga just like that
You don't throw away what we had, just like that
You leave a real nigga shawty I bet you come right back
And you say that I cheated in the past, that's true
And in the future I did everything you asked me Boo
Yeah I cheated and you cheated
But in the end, it's in the wind baby where we meet
It's not the end, we pretend
And make this our little secret
Emotional roller coaster, the pain is almost over
The monkey is off my shoulder

I can't find no love here

Lil Uno,"Yeah, on
I need a, I want a

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
I need a girl who's mine all mine
I need a girl in my life

Yo, I'm internationally known on the microphone
I got it all, but I really need a wife at home
I don't really like the zone, never spend the night alone
I got a few, you would like to bone
But, chicks don't romance me, don't tickle my fancy
Only Tiffany, Nancy; that's not what my plans be
I need a girl that could stand me, raise me a family
Go to trips at the Lancy, trip to the Grammy's 'cause
Most of these girls be confusing me
I don't know if they really love me or they using me
Maybe is the money, or maybe you ain't used to me
'Cause you was depressed and now you abusing me
That's why I need a girl that be true to me
Know bout the game, and know how to do to me
Without a girl on my side, shit I ruin me
Forget the word, it's just you and me

Now let's ride

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
I need a girl who's mine all mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
Nobody else 'cause she's all mine
I need a girl in my life

Yo, now I have had a lot of women in my lifetime
But see it's not a lot of women that got the right mind
I done had pretty chicks with all the right features
And hood rat chicks that only rock sneakers
Cell phones and beepers, and know how to treat ya
You break her heart, she'll walk out and leave ya
I find a girl, I'ma keep her
'Cause now I'm getting money and the game getting deeper
I want some real shit, I need somebody I can chill with
I need somebody I can build with
I need somebody I can hold tight
With the time and no full limits, no right
Anytime we together would feel so right
You the girl I been looking for my whole life
God bless me, I'm glad I got the insight
Because of you girl, now I understand life

I need a girl

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
I need a girl who's mine all mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
Nobody else 'cause she's all mine
I need a girl in my life

I had a girl that would've died for me
Didn't appreciate her so I made her cry for me
Every night she had tears in her eyes for me
Caught a case, shorty took the whole ride for me
First we were friends then became lovers
You was more than my girl, we was like brothers
All night we would play fight under covers
Now you gone, can't love you like I really want to
But every time I think about your pretty smile
And how we used to drive the whole city wild
Damn I wish you would've had my child
A pretty little girl wit Diddy's style
This shit is wild
All damn days that I reminisce
About the way I use to kiss them pretty lips
But as long as you happy, I'ma tell you this
I love you girl and you're the one that I will always miss
I love you, yeah

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
I need a girl who's mine all mine
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
Nobody else 'cause she's all mine
I need a girl in my life

I just want you to be my baby
I just need you to be my baby
I just want to be my baby 
I just need you to be my baby","Voices, Pt. 2"
