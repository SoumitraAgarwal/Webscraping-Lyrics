Dionne Bromfield,"Listen, so convinced that he's the one
And he loves you
Obsessed with being in his arms
No, he's got a girlfriend
He says he's with her to get under your skin

Told you once, I told you twice
He don't love u
But your rather believe the lie
Keep pushing through the way
And you don't hear a word I gotta say
And you continue to deny
That love has made you blind

'Cause your living in your own world
Everybody knows what's going on
But just talking a baboo
Your just dreaming in your own world
You're on your own
Can't say that your ain't being told

Ignorance is never placed, don't be stupid
Listening to so called friends
'cause when you walk away 
I hear what they won't say to your face

I knew your rather just pretend 
But I wish I could knock some sense into your head
Don't watch u hurt to way
When it finally come to reality
But you continue to deny
That love has made you blind

'Cause your living in your own world
Everybody knows what's going on
But just talking a baboo
Your just dreaming in your own world
You're on your own
Can't say that your ain't being told

I don't need no hide no feelings
But a real friend would tell you the truth
I tried to get u to attempted 
But u just refuse

'Cause your living in your own world
Everybody knows what's going on
But just talking a baboo
Your just dreaming in your own world
You're on your own
Can't say that your ain't being told",In Your Own World
Dionne Bromfield,"I had a dream
And I can't stop thinking about it, baby
You said to me
You were serious and that you loved me

Dreams are just like stars
Oh, they are hard to reach
Then they fall and they burn so deep

Oh, now my heart is awake
It's hard when it breaks but I will recover
And oh, little love's gonna shatter
My heart, she's a fighter
Just a little love, oh, oh, oh
It's just a little love, oh, oh, oh
It's just a little love
Oh, now my heart is awake
It's hard when it breaks
But it's just a little love

There was a time
I believed in every word you said
And yes, maybe I've been
A bit naive, a bit misled but

Time is running out, oh
And we can't rewind
Doesn't matter how hard we try

Oh, now my heart is awake
It's hard when it breaks but I will recover
And oh, little love's gonna shatter
My heart, she's a fighter
It's just a little love, oh, oh, oh
It's just a little love, oh, oh, oh
It's just a little love
Oh, now my heart is awake
It's hard when it breaks
But it's just a little love

Dionne Bromfield,"I've fall out a few times
But never this far
I never knew I'd
Surrender my heart

Ouch that hurt
Come kiss it better
Oh my my

Kisses it better for you

Dionne Bromfield,"Do you still remember our love?
Do you still remember our love?

I saw you standing there, I tried not to stare
But then it's been so long since you were in my life
I couldn't help but see you still look good to me
But where did we go wrong, I thought our love was strong

Maybe we were just too young then to know it
So why did it hurt so bad?

So if our song begins to play, will it take you far away?
Do you still remember our love?
Would you wish for yesterday and all the promises you made?
Do you still remember our love?

Will you remember our love, along the way oh?

You're walking up to me, yeah, I can hardly breathe
But then I see your smile and all my fears pass by
You ask me how I've been and can we still be friends
I don't know what to say but we'll try to find a way

Maybe we were just too young then to know it
So why does it hurt so bad?

So if our song begins to play, will it take you far away?
Do you still remember our love?
Would you wish for yesterday and all the promises you made?
Do you still remember our love?

It-It's spinnin' again
It-uh-uh spinning again

We go for pain and try to shine in the perfect the moment
We let it burn inside knowing the path is golden
See the strain in our eyes, we're gonna do our best
You and me will give it all until nothing is left
We're gonna catch the light and stay alive and feel the love coming from the flame

The world keeps spinning,
Changing the lives of people in it
Nobody knows where it will take us
But we hope it gets better, better, better

We can stand the rain
The clouds, they're all gone
World on my shoulder
Standing so strong
Chase my path with all the clues gone,
Success and I is like a true one
Dropping it out
Or pulling this offload
Negative vibe
We just step forward
Swinging the arrow
We push it forth
Winning's the key
To make us known

The world is spinnin' faster
Day by day gets harder
Oh, I'm a soldier
Fighting till it's over, yeah

Go when the hope is gone
Just keep it strong
And feel the love
Coming from the flame

The world keeps spinning,
Changing the lives of people in it
Nobody knows where it will take us
But we hope it gets better, better, better

One day I know that,
It will get better
Music is healing
I love the feeling
Today I know that,
It will get better
Music is healing
I love the feeling
One day all people
Will be all equal
Until that day comes,
I'll just be singing my song

The world keeps spinning,
Changing the lives of people in it
Nobody knows where it will take us
But we hope it gets better, better, better

The world keeps spinning,
Changing the lives of people in it
Nobody knows where it will take us
But we hope it gets better, better, better

As the world spins
We'll keep trying
If we hold tight
We'll keep shining
As the world spins
We'll keep trying
If we hold tight
We'll keep shining",Sminnin' For 2012 [*]
Dionne Bromfield,"Tried to make it look more real
Friends don't tell me you don't feel the same
I don't listen to what they say

Then that would be the sweetest thing

Dionne Bromfield,"It came out of the blue
Like a brand new story
Waiting to begin

Like the stars and the moon
Were counting on me
To go rushing in

Now the answers
Are all around
It's all that I can do
To keep my feet on the ground

[Chorus]
'Cause when the tears
Roll down my face
Only you can make it better
When it rains
On my days
I know who can change the weather
And when I'm down
And there's no one around
Then it's you I'm thinking of
But it's too soon
To call it love

Know it's making it slow
Taking something
One step at a time

When it's too soon to know
When it's going
Best to stand behind the line

When the answers are all around
No point in letting go
Of the thing you have found

Dionne Bromfield,"Yo what up Dionne it's Diggy
I got 'em caught up in the studio doing some things
So I'm a hit you later

Maybe you caught the train just like you said you did
Maybe it broke down but you didn't give up
Maybe you got pinned down by all the weight of gifts
That you were bringing me to show your love
Maybe you got lost on the way back to my house
Maybe you called and I was on the phone
Maybe you thought if you were late I'd throw you out
Maybe you think I like being on my own

Dionne Farris,"She screams out every night in a billion tears
In desperate fear that you're somewhere near
Faulting her action for all that's occurred
Wanting to tell all, never saying a word

Because she believes you're her hero

But if you persist, she just might hurt you
So I suggest you refrain and don't ever touch me (again)

Don't ever touch me (again)

Only inches away from pure insanity
Releasing the anger, the hurt, heartache and rage
No more feeling like an animal stalked, trapped and caged

Because she believes she's a survivor
She knows that she's on the right track
But just you remember she's a beginner
So I suggest you refrain and don't ever touch me (again)

don't ever touch me (again)

haunted by the ghost of the thing left to past
In fear of the presence, the power it has
Realizing there's always a calm before the storm
But there's no one left to keep her from harm
Because she is unable to distinguish one from another
All she knows is she's not going to let it happen again
You should have left this one alone, but I bet you won't ever touch her (again)",Don't Ever Touch Me (Again)

Using food for thought and thought for food
All I have is my attitude, the hour glass
And my ever-changing mood

Faced with a challenge of doing all the novel talk
Wondering how to pay for the things my mouth has bought

Wanting to say the right things whenever I talk
I changed the way I stood and the way I walked

Lord help me find my way
So that I may go forward
And lead the way

Why is green green?
What if it's really blue?
And is what we think we think really true?
It is said that ""I think, therefore I am""
Are we really thinking?

There's a change taking place in my mind

Is it just for the moment we live?
What's it all about when you sort it out, Alfie?
Are we meant to take more than we give
or are we meant to be kind?
And if only fools are kind, Alfie,
then I guess it's wise to be cruel.
And if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie,
what will you lend on an old golden rule?
As sure as I believe there's a heaven above, Alfie,
I know there's something much more,
something even non-believers can believe in.
I believe in love, Alfie.
Without true love we just exist, Alfie.
Until you find the love you've missed you're nothing, Alfie.
When you walk let your heart lead the way
and you'll find love any day, Alfie, Alfie.

Dionne Warwick,"Yesterday I heard the rain
Whispering your name
Asking where you'd gone

It fell softly from the clouds
On the silent crowds
As I wandered on

Out of doorways black umbrellas
Came to pursue me
Faceless people as they passed
Were looking through me, no one knew me

Yesterday I shut my eyes
Face-up to the skies
Drinkin' in the rain

But your image still was there
Floating in the air
Brighter than a flame

Yesterday I saw a city
Full of shadows without pity
And I heard the steady rain
Whispering your name
Whispering your name

Asking where you've gone

Yesterday I saw a city
Full of shadows without pity
And I heard the steady rain
Whispering your name
Whispering your name

",Yesterday I Heard the Rain
Dionne Warwick,"I said remember this moment
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

I said remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""this is absurd""
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped up jeans got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, ""long live the look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Can you take a moment
Promise me this:
That you'll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children someday
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you

Long, long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Singing long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
And long, long live the look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders

He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored
He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword
His truth is marching on, His truth is marching

Glory, glory, Hallelujah! Glory, glory, Hallelujah!
Glory, glory, Hallelujah! His truth is marching on

I have seen Him in the watch fires of a hundred circling camps
They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps
I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps
His day is marching on

Hallelujah, Hallelujah!

In the beauty of the lilies, Christ was born across the sea
With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me
As He died to make men holy, let us live to make men free

Night after night and I wish for a love that can be

No one can tell where a wishes and hopes will lead
Time, how I feel there is happiness just waiting there for me

Walks in your life, you just better be sure he's right

How quick they pass
And all the stars that never were
Are parking cars and pumping gas

You can really breathe in San Jose
They've got a lot of space
There'll be a place where I can stay
I was born and raised in San Jose
I'm going back to find some peace of mind in San Jose

Fame and fortune is a magnet
It can pull you far away from home
With a dream in your heart you're never alone

Dreams turn into dust and blow away
And there you are without a friend
You pack your car and ride away

I've got lots of friends in San Jose
Do you know the way to San Jose?

L.A. is a great big freeway
Put a hundred down and buy a car
In a week, maybe two, they'll make you a star

Weeks turn into years, how quick they pass
And all the stars that never were
Are parking cars and pumping gas

I've got lots of friends in San Jose
Do you know the way to San Jose?
Can't wait to get back to San Jose",Do You Know the Way to San Jose?
Dionne Warwick,"The world outside your house is cold and windy
The summer breeze becomes a winter storm
And then you smile at me
And almost instantly
The weather turns warm

Slowly the green grass starts to grow
Softly the sunshine of your smile
Melts the snow

When I'm alone the streets are dark and cloudy
I walk around not knowing danger of night
And then you touch my hand
That's all that happens
And the whole world turns bright

Slowly the green grass starts to grow
Softly the sunshine of your smile
Melts the snow

To me you're everything that's true
My world begins and it will end
With only you
Forever

Softly the sunshine of your smile

Dionne Warwick,"I just don't know what to do with myself
Don't know just what to do with myself
I'm so used to doing everything with you
Planning everything for two
And now that we're through

I just don't know what to do with my time
I'm so lonesome for you, it's a crime
Going to a movie only makes me sad
Parties make me feel as bad
When I'm not with you, I just don't know what to do

Like a summer rose
Needs the sun and rain
I need your sweet love to beat all the pain

I just don't know what to do with myself
I don't know just what to do with myself
Oh baby, if your new love ever turns you down
Come on back, I will be around

Before I put on my makeup
I say a little prayer for you
While combing my hair, now
And wondering what dress to wear, now
I say a little prayer for you

Forever, forever, you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever, and ever we never will part
Oh, how I'll love you
Together, together, that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only be heartbreak for me

I run for the bus, dear
While riding I think of us, dear
I say a little prayer for you
At work I just take time
And all through my coffee break-time
I say a little prayer for you

Forever, forever, you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever, and ever we never will part
Oh, how I'll love you
Together, together, that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me

And I will love you

Oh, how I'll love you
Together, together, that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me

My darling, believe me
For me there is no one, but you
Please love me, too

Say you love me, too

Dionne Warwick,"Promises, promises
I'm all through with promises, promises now
I don't know how I got the nerve to walk out
If I shout, remember I feel free

Now I can look at myself and be proud
I'm laughing out loud
Oh, promises, promises
This is where those promises, promises end

I don't pretend that what was wrong can be right
Every night I sleep now, no more lies
Things that I promised myself fell apart
But I found my heart

Oh, promises, their kind of promises, can just destroy a life
Oh, promises, those kind of promises, take all the joy from life
Oh, promises, promises, my kind of promises
Can lead to joy and hope and love

Yes, love!!
Every night I sleep now, no more lies
Things that I promised myself fell apart

Dionne Warwick,"Gotta get off, gonna get
Have to get off from this ride
Gotta get hold, gonna get
Need to get hold of my pride

When did I get, where did I
How was I caught in this game
When will I know, where will I
How will I think of my name

When did I stop feeling sure, feeling safe
And start wondering why, wondering why
Is this a dream, am I here, where are you
What's in back of the sky, why do we cry

Gotta get off, gonna get
Out of this merry-go-round
Gotta get off, gonna get
Need to get on where I'm bound

When did I get, where did I
Why am I lost as a lamb
When will I know, where will I
How will I learn who I am

Is this a dream, am I here, where are you
Tell me, when will I know, how will I know
When will I know why",Theme from Valley of the Dolls
Dionne Warwick,"Who can I turn to
When nobody needs me
My heart wants to know
And so I must go
Where destiny leads me

With no star to guide me
And no one beside me
I'll go on my way
And, after the day
The darkness will hide me

And maybe tomorrow
I'll find what I'm after
I'll throw off my sorrow
Beg, steal, or borrow
My share of laughter

With you I could learn to
With you what a new day
But who can I turn to
If you turn away

With you I could learn to
With you what a new day
But who can I turn to
If you turn away",Who Can I Turn To (When Nobody Needs Me)
Dionne Warwick,"The windows of the world are covered with rain
Where is the sunshine we once knew?
Everybody knows when little children play
They need a sunny day to grow straight and tall
Let the sun shine through

The windows of the world are covered with rain
When will those black skies turn to blue?
Everybody knows when boys grow into men
They start to wonder when their country will call
Let the sun shine through

The windows of the world are covered with rain
What is the whole world coming to?
Everybody knows when men can not be friends
Their quarrel often ends where some have to die
Let the sun shine through

The windows of the world are covered with rain
There must be something we can do
Everybody knows whenever rain appears
It's really angel tears
How long must they cry?
Let the sun shine through",The Windows of the World

Wake up to become early mornin' strangers
Things always look different in the light of day

When there's nothin' to say

Early mornin' strangers
Lookin' at each other
That is all we are to one another

Who wake up to discover
It's just no good without love
To live without love is no life at all

Somewhere baby there's a life worth livin'
Where nobody takes more than they are givin'
Where love is forever

This time we almost sang our song in tune
Didn't we, love?

And we'd sing of the joy every morning would bring

If I ruled the world, ev'ry man would be as free as a bird,
Ev'ry voice would be a voice to be heard
Take my word we would treasure each day that occurred

My world would be a beautiful place
Where we would weave such wonderful dreams
My world would wear a smile on it's face
Like the man in the moon has when the moon beams
If I ruled the world every man would say the world was his friend

Dionne Warwick,"They say that falling in love is wonderful
It's wonderful, so they say

And, with a moon up above, it's wonderful
It's wonderful, so they tell me

I can't recall who said it
I know I never read it
I only know they tell me that love is grand
And

The thing that's known as romance is wonderful, wonderful
In every way, so they say

To leave your house some morning
And, without any warning
You're stopping people, shouting that love is grand
And

To hold a girl in your arms is wonderful, wonderful
In every way
So they say",They Say It's Wonderful
Dionne Warwick,"Who gets the guy at the end of the show?
I'd like to know
People say you have found another
Is it true, what they say?

When the picture's over, will it be all over?
Tell me, who gets the guy
In that last sweet caress?
Don't make me guess

Lovin' you has become my whole life
I can't live without you
When it's time to walk out
Are you gonna walk out?

And that's why I just keep listenin'
To the music to see if it's happy or sad
Because if it's happy that's how I feel
And if it's sad, well, that's too bad for me

Woah, can't you see just how much I need you?
It just has to be me
Tell me that the ending is a happy ending for me
And that I get the guy

Dionne Warwick,"You're my world, you're every breath I take
You're my world, you're every move I make
Although I see the stars up in the skies
But for me they shine within your eyes

As the trees reach for the sun above
So my arms reach out to you for love
With your hand resting in mine
I feel a power so divine

You're my world, you're every prayer I pray
You're my world, you're every breath I take
If our love ceases to be
That is the end of my world for me

With your hand resting in mine
I feel a power that is so, so divine

You're my world, you are my night, my day

That is the end of my world

You still know what to do
You still know how to make me feel
There's no one else but you

And you think that things
Adjust the way they used to be
But I can see

It in your eyes
I see that you wanna run away
And in your eyes
I don't see the kind of love you say

Is in your heart
'Cause in your eyes there's another face
And not a trace of me

You still know when to touch
You still know when to call
And sometimes when you hold me close
I'd swear we had it all

Oh, it isn't that
You're not the man you used to be
It's what I see

There in your eyes
I see that you wanna run away
And in your eyes
I don't see the kind of love you say

Is in your heart
'Cause in your eyes there's another face
And not a trace of me
No, not a trace of me

Dionne Warwick,"An old friend told me that you just ran out of chances,
One too many dances down the narrow street of time.
Remember how we faced the world, like two tramps shining.
Please, don't let that magic ever end.
Don't forget what we learned living on the wind.

No night so long that you can't find the day;
No day so wrong that you can't find your way;
Call on me like you used to do,
I still can show you who you are.

That day the long and dusty road had us both crying,
We used up our last joke just to try to smile a again.
And only now I find I know what we were learning,
Though it's dark and you have traveled far.
Every long night gives you one bright shining star.

No night so long that you can't find the day;
No day so wrong that you can't find your way;
Call on me like you used to do,
I can still show you who you are.

Deep in the night you know that you'll find,
Deep in the night you know that you'll find the way.
No night so long that you can't find the day;
No day so wrong that you can't find your way;
Call on me like you used to do,
I still can show you who you are.

No day so wrong that you can't find your way.",No Night So Long
Dionne Warwick,"When we gave up, oh, forever
When we couldn't stay together
After all the tears and trying
We drank some wine
You went your way and I went mine

But we never said, ""Goodbye""
Never understood what happened
Never said, ""Goodbye""
Ever wonder why
We never said, ""Goodbye""

I tried so hard to forget you
I tried so hard living without you
I always thought some day I'd find out
Waited so long
First it was here then it was gone

But we never said, ""Goodbye""
Never understood what happened
Never said, ""Goodbye""
Did you ever wonder why?
We never said, ""Goodbye""

Maybe tonight
We will realize our love that we have
Maybe tonight
We can fill each other's eyes and be glad

The nights are long thinking about you
I can't help hoping it's not true
I can't help the way I'm feeling
Maybe it's time
Give me your love, tell me it's mine

Cause we never said, ""Goodbye""
We never got around to
What went wrong with you and I

So just say the word and tell me that I'm forgiven

Some flicker of love that still shines through
Let's talk it out, let's talk about second chances

Wait and see, it's gonna be sweeter than it was before

And the days of our years
Will rise on that morn

Then the parched desert earth
Will grow green again

For the song that we sing
Then we'll have a way out

We can reach those in pain
We can heal all our wounds
We can use our own names
If we only have love
We can melt all the guns

To our daughters and sons
If we only have love
Then Jerusalem stands
And then death has no shadow
There are no foreign lands
If we only have love
We will never bow down
We'll be tall as the pines
Neither heroes nor clowns
If we only have love
Then we'll only be men
And we'll drink from the Grail
To be born once again
Then with nothing at all
But the little we are
We'll have conquered all time

One less egg to fry
One less man to pick up after
I should be happy

But all I do is cry
No more laughter
I should be happy
Why did he go?

I only know that
Since he left my life's so empty
Though I try to forget, it just can't be done
Each time the doorbell rings I still run

I don't know how in the world
Just stop thinking of him
'Cause I still love him so
Ah, and each day the way I start out
Crying my heart out

One less bell to answer
One less egg to fry
One less man to pick up after
No more laughter, no more love
Since he, he went away
Oh, one less

Now that I have found you
How did I live without you (I don't know, baby)
It's plain to see you're all I need
To satisfy me

I'm so darn proud of you
I want to sing about you (Sing, sing, sing, baby)
So all I know you made love grow
By touchin' my hand

Then came you, you, then came you

Dionne Warwick,"Well, I can't cross that bridge in my mind
Did we dance? One too many times
Can I still feel the love as I'm looking at you?
Do we hold on or say that we're through? What should we do?

Walk away when pride seems to get in our way
And we wish love was like yesterday
Through love and through tears, sacrificing those years in one day
Two people turn and walk away, ooh, they walk away

Just tell me, how did we come to this place? Where did love go?
Cause we once had a taste, all those magical nights
Lovers in dreams till we hated each other again
That's no way to end

Walk away when pride seems to get in our way
And we wish love was like yesterday
Through love and through tears watching all other years
End in a day when two people walk away, walk away

Oh baby, how can you say goodbye
When there's still some love deep inside
And together we can make it right
Afraid to be lovers and say
Hoping that they all move and stay
Don't you turn and walk away, walk away

Oh, can't you see I love you, don't you walk away
Oh, don't walk away
Oh baby, through love and through tears
Sacrificing those years in one day
You'll never walk, will walk away

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying

Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.
What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;
So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine.

To come home to some happy day
What a day that will be

I wanna be there, be there by the door

If I deceive him even once, I couldn't face him
Oh, I know I couldn't face him

If I give in to loneliness
And hold you tight

I wanna be there, be there by his side
All through my life and if I ever let him down
I have to tell him, oh yes, I have to tell him
And if I did, what could he do?
He'd say goodbye and I would die, yes

It is the night of the dear Savior's birth.
Long lay the world in sin and error pining.
Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!
O night divine, the night when Christ was born;
O night, O Holy Night , O night divine!
O night, O Holy Night , O night divine!

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming,
Now come the wisemen from out of the Orient land.
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another,
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
With all our hearts we praise His holy name.
Christ is the Lord! Then ever, ever praise we,
His power and glory ever more proclaim!
His power and glory ever more proclaim!",O Holy Night

You are my shining light
In the shadow of the night
Yes the love that you see

In every part of me
One touch you set me free

Cause love so often dies

Won't be fooled by fantasy
Cause I believe in you and me
And we'll never say goodbye

After all that I've been through
I am so grateful that love begins with you

Before we go
Make this moment live again

For all we know
This might only be a dream
We come and we go

Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with strings

Door bells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
These are a few of my favorite things

Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters that melt into Springs

When the dog bites
When the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad.

Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Now I prove again that I can make life move again.

Setting my being completely on fire!

Turn my head around, destroy the love that I've found
You are the cause of all my pain
Yes, you're to blame, now he's gone

Because of plain old jealousy

Plain old jealousy that made me lose
Everything that was good for me, that jealousy

Let me live again, enjoy my life till the end

Now look straight at me, I'm all alone

The lilt of our laughter made a beautiful sound

Before it would shine

And it hurts me more than I can bear to go on alone

My lips long to kiss you like they kissed you before
My arms would do anything to hold you once more

We owned the stars
Half of them were yours
The others were mine

And now the wine is young
Our dreams are old

And it hurts me more than I can bear to go on alone

Dionne Warwick,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to be spy
To see reindeer really know how to fly

And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

All it takes is you to understand and
To pull him through, ah hah

We got to solve it individually, ah ah
And I'll do unto you what you do to me
Said, no

Hear the shoutin' from the mountains on out to the sea
No two ways about it, people have to be free (they gotta be free)
Ask me my opinion, my opinion will be
Natural situation for a man to be free

Get right on board now, huh, huh

Yeah oh, what a feelin's just come over me
Love can move a mountain, make a blind man see
Everybody sing it now come on let's go see
Peace in the valley now, we all can be free

Des flammes me pousses
à la place des cils
Grâce à ma tête d'Irlandais
Personne n'a rien remarqué.

Elles s'éprennent de lui

Et elles se levez la nuit
Pour se faire parfumer

Il se mit à lécher tout son corps
Pour se laver car vous savez
On est jamais trop coquet

Il se mit à danser

Comme un grand possédé
Mais hélas ?

Dionysos,"Un jour, peut-être pas le jour le plus froid du monde,
Mais pas loin, je décidais de retirer mon horloge.
De lourds flocons gorgés de pluie s'amoncelaient sur mes épaules
""C'est un bon jour pour s'arracher le cœur"" me suis-je dit.

Lorsque j'ai tiré dessus,
J'ai eu l'impression qu'un bulldozer était en train de tout casser entre mes poumons.
Les gens disent qu'on voit une lumière très intense quand la mort arrive,
En ce qui me concerne, je n'ai vu que des ombres.
Des ombres géantes, à perte de vue et une tempête de neige aux flocons noirs.

La neige recouvrait progressivement mon corps,
D'abord les mains, puis les bras écartés.
Des roses semblaient pousser de la neige tellement le sang gorgeait la poudreuse,
Puis elles se sont effacées.
Mon visage, puis mon corps tout entier ont disparu.

J'étais étrangement détendu et anxieux en même temps,
Comme si je me préparais à un très long voyage en avion.
Un dernier bouquet d'étincelles a poussé sous mes paupières,
Le souvenir de Miss Acacia dansant en équilibre sur ses petits talons aiguilles,
Docteur Madeleine penchée sur moi, remontant l'horloge de mon coeur,
Arthur en train de vociférer son swing à coups de
""Oh when the saints go marchin' in""
Puis Miss Acacia dansant en équilibre sur ses petits talons aiguilles,
Encore et encore.

Nous étions le 28 octobre 1906, l'horloge,
Mon cœur et sa mécanique se sont arrêtés pour de bon.

Dionysos,"J'ai perdu mes lunettes
Enfin j'ai pas voulu les mettre
Elles me font une drôle de tête
Une tête de flamme à lunette.

OH petite allumette
C'est dangereux d'être coquette
Au point de n'en faire qu'à sa tête
Quand ça peux vous coûtez les yeux

Je me fou
D'y voir flou
Je n'ai pas besoin de lunette
Pour embrasser et chanter
Je préfère garder les yeux fermés

Oh, mon petit incendie
Laissez-moi croquer vos habits
Les déchiqueter à belles dents
Les recracher en confettis
Pour vous embrassez sous une pluie

De confettis?

Oui, allons y.

Je n'y vois que du feu
En quelques pas seulement
Je peux me perdre au loin
Si loin dans ma rue
Et même que je n'ose plus
Regarder le soleil
N'y regarder le ciel
Droit dans les yeux
Je n'y vois que du feu

Je vous guiderai
A l'extérieur de votre tête
Je serai votre paire de lunette
Vous seriez mon allumette.

Il me faut vous faire un aveu
Je vous entends mais je ne pourrai
Jamais vous reconnaître
Même assis entre deux petits vieux.

On se frottera
L'un contre l'être
A s'en faire cramer le squelette
Et à l'horloge de mon cœur
A minuit pile on prendra feu
Pas même besoin d'ouvrir les yeux

Je sais je suis une flamme de tête
Mais quand la musique s'arrête
J'ai du mal à rouvrir les yeux
Je m'enflamme allumette
Mes paupières brûlent de mille feux
A en écraser mes lunettes
Sans penser à rouvrir les yeux.

Elle danse comme un oiseau
En équilibre,
Sur ses petits talons aiguilles
Ses pieds commencent à s'emmêler
Son joli nez viens de s'écraser

Sur le pavé.
Je me fracasse la tête
Contre les arbres dont les feuilles bleues
Semblent plantées dans les cieux
Ils sont ce que l'on confond le mieux
Avec les cieux
C'est merveilleux
les arbres bleus.

Oh grand jamais tu ne devras oublier

Premièrement ne touche pas à tes aiguilles
Deuxièmement ta colère tu devras maîtriser 
Et surtout ne jamais oublier quoi qu'il arrive,
Ne jamais se laisser tomber amoureux,
Car alors pour toujours,
À l'horloge de ton cœur la grande aiguille des heures transpercera ta peau,
Explosera l'horloge, imploseront tes os,
La mécanique du cœur 
Sera brisée de nouveau.

To make nice decorations in the ghost train
She was scarier than the ghost train and she wants me to frighten people,
me little me
If you walk on skull and break something you pay
But I was the king of the ghost train, 'cause all the people want to see my heart bleeding
I was the king of the ghost train until the day when the little fire girl comes to see me

I don't care about scary woman and all her houses full of emptiness

Moi le nouveau je le trouve étrange
Il a de drôle d'occupation souvent
Il couve des œufs dans la manche de son pull
Alors dès que je peux à la récréation
Je les lui casse sur le crâne sans aucun scrupule
Nous n'avons vraiment rien en commun sauf
Une chose découverte avec horreur
Il est amoureux de la même fille que moi
Il n'aurais jamais dû c'est une grave erreur

Cette fille c'est la petite chanteuse
C'est ma petite amie depuis longtemps
Elle s'appelle Miss Acacia
Et elle chante en moi à chaque instant
Depuis peu malheureusement
Elle est repartie dans son pays l'Andalousie
Et le nouveau qui ose me parler d'elle
Est en train de décupler ma jalousie

La présence inutile de ce nabot renforce
La cruelle absence de mon amour
Il semble l'aimer presque autant que moi
Et si ça continue je crois bien qu'un jour
Ce n'est pas ses œufs mais son cœur en bois
Que sur son crâne je vais briser
Pour qu'il ne soit plus jamais capable d'aimer
C'est bien son cœur que je dois viser",Thème de Joe

I am guided by harmonies, remnants of song
Beats of a lonely heart is leading the way
Silence is broken in the halls of the dead
Until she's found I won't give up, I'll carry on!

[Chorus]

Chaos calling me

Until she's found I won't give up
I'll carry on!

[Chorus]",Tides Will Turn
Dionysus,"Don't need your understanding
Live the mess I'm in
I'm in a chain reaction
Let me in
I saw the big lights flashing
Ruin the entire land
I still hear children screaming
Goin' insane

Fighting all the demons
In the middle of the night
I open my eyes and I just see I'm still alive

[Chorus]
Here's another story of the world I'm living in
You can see a hero fall tonight
I see dark angels fly
Nothing else remains a mystery

Smiling on the outside
Empty on the inside
Lost even my direction
Where to go?
I'm still in this madhouse
My life's just one big lie
No more air to breath
We're face to face

Covered by a smiling mask
To hide all our sins
But really have to see
That there's no more truth within!

[Chorus: x2]",The World
Dionysus,"Dreams are engaging in battle
Cosmos is rising to fight
Our world is neglected and falling
Gaia, she screams in the night!

On the verge of decay and destruction
Hope is what keeps her alive
Sending her plea to her people
That nothing is written in stone

See the sun
See the sky
Hear the whispers of the wind
Take the time
Live the dream
Be the Anima Mundi

Clouds are beginning to muster
Oceans are stirring beneath
Life as it was may be lost now
'Cause Gaia, she screams in the night!

On the edge of the ending eternity
Hope is what keeps her alive
Sending her plea to her people
That fate can be altered somehow

See the sun
See the sky
Hear the whispers of the wind
Take the time
Live the dream
Be the Anima Mundi

A star on the night sky
Guiding her hopes
Her dreams are in motion
A sign of light
All will be well again

See the sun
See the sky
Hear the whispers of the wind
Take the time
Live the dream",Anima Mundi
Dionysus,"A cold cunning razor smile
Is cutting through your spine
Words of evil, deeds of greed
Into the mouth of the nation he's sowing his seed

What's done can't come undone
But don't let us do it again
Have all we taught been so wrong
If not ""Why are you singing this song""

Remember, a single spark can ignite the fire
Inside its womb you're his soul desire

The bringer of war

Like a phoenix he arose from the ashes
But did you ever see him come?
Even though his eyes are shining true
He's not the savior for me, nor for you

What's that sound I'm hearing?
Hasn't he been here once before?
A malefactor, promising to take down the sun
It seems like our past has come undone

Remember, a single spark can ignite the fire
Inside its womb you're his sole desire

The bringer of war",Bringer of War
Dionysus,"From the remnants of myth I come
A mythago alive once again
I was born from the mists of time
From the legends that whisper my name

I'm the dream of a thousand minds
Come to set things right
And by my honor I hereby swear
Love will conquer all

It's my gift to replenish life
Can you feel the surge of vitality?
If you join me and heed my call
Together we'll redraw reality

I'm the wish of a thousand hearts
A wish to set things right
And by my honor I hereby swear
Love will conquer all

Chaos awake in my hand
I am your fate
I am darkness and light

Dionysus,"Longing to see what I wanted to be
It never got out of my soul
To really fulfill what my dreams've always been
Though sometimes it feels just too far
What if I never had chosen this path?
What if this might never be?
Life is short and it just slips away
Live free now right here and today!

On a long and windy journey
I will pray I never fall

I look through the eyes of the world
I see a shining star
So few put any trust in you
So many can't think far

I look through the eyes of the world
I see a shining star
So few put any trust in you
But see who you are!
A bright newborn star

Yours is the power of living the dream
To follow the waves of the see
You know that to live is love and be loved
To give and to fight, to be free
All I can see is the truth in your eyes
The love and the goodness inside
I pray there is shelter wherever you go
For keeping you safe from the storm

On a long and windy journey
I pray you?ll never fall

I look through the eyes of the world
I see a shining star
So few put any trust in you
So many can't think far

I look through the eyes of the world
I see a shining star
So few put any trust in you
But see who you are!

Dionysus,"When I'm down and out without the strength to carry on
The sun still reaches your hair as it's always done
Will I ever see you again, just one last time?
Anyhow I cannot feel any peace of mind

All around the world the fallen ones will see
That love was never ever meant for me
I'm torn apart but how could I flee?
I would die for you, so please come rescue me

'Cause I wonder where you are
Have our freedom gone too far?
Is there still an open door?
I will love you forever ever more

I realize that life is never easy
But in my heart, I'd hoped for something greater
A dream I guess, but something to hold on to
A rainbow on a darkening, rainy sky

'Cause my body's caught, but still my soul is out there
They can take away my life, but not my freedom
My love is all that matters, you'll see
I would die for you, so please come rescue me

'Cause I wonder where you are
Have our freedom gone too far?
Is there still an open door?
I will love you forever ever more

Dionysus,"Earth was made round so we'd see
There's no borders to be found.
Mankind, under the same sun
Evolution never stopped

The empires fell apart,
They all will rise and fall,
Creations survived the time,
The ones built by us all

Child of time, born in the new dimension
You are sent to find the key into the past
Make them see that all their true beloved ones,
In a time to come had love to conquer all

There was thousand years of peace
Mankind changed the history

And left hatred far behind",Key into the Past [*]
Dionysus,"Luther King, Theresia and Mandela

They fought and meant to be heard!

Dedicated, filled with spirit
Truthfully they followed their harts
They had a dream that they would die for
It's time to gather us all!

Keep on walk and march for freedom
All over lands and seas
Keep on walk and march for freedom
Mankind is set to be free!

Light the torch, step out of the darkness
Feel the wind of change

Dionysus,"Never thought I'd be caught in the web
Like a lamb lying down to be slaughtered
Put down your walls for a minute
I want to let you know what is on my mind

I am trying to find the words
To reveal the scenery
I was never enough for you
And it splits my soul in two
Every time you go

My heart is crying
Every time you walk away I'm dying
I know I have to be strong and fight it
But when you look at me I fail to hide it
I can't let you go
I just want you to know
I'm like a leaf that keeps on falling.

Never thought I'd be lost on my own
Never dreamed I would suffer such pain
Now put down your walls for a minute
We have to work this out, doesn't matter how

I am trying to find the words
To reveal the scenery
I was never enough for you
And it splits my soul in two
Every time you go

My heart is crying
Every time you walk away I'm dying
I know I have to be strong and fight it
But when you look at me I fail to hide it
I can't let you go
I just want you to know
I'm like a leaf that keeps on falling.

Time will go on eventually
My heart will heal again
But you will forever be the one
The one that haunts my heart and soul
Forever more

Dionyza Sutton,"I believe that children are our future;
Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

All twelve Reggie Hammond, holding hammers him
Never speak, he like that short silent type
I’m in the mountains shovin' knives, drinking wine at night
Rose petals get thrown to the feet
Know we grow knee ’cause even in this rap don't work we got stones in the street
Go down in Tallahassee, work and come home in a week
See me stoned in a Jeep with the chrome on the feet
Leather overalls, shirtless like I'm Kells in the street
Posing for flicks, leaning on an English whip
With the float ware straight from the aquarium
My bitch built like secretariat, yeah, bring the chariot
I fuck the pussy, not marry it, world on my shoulders, dougie, I carry it
I’m more than happy with my bitch, she got no saggy tits
I’ll do it old school style and give her baggy dick

Rock, rock, very
Slow, slow, steady
Base, base, heavy
Drum, drums, ready

They talk in cents, diamonds in our tooths and dinner (ice)
Rap game Burt Reynolds in a candy canteloupe car rental
I’m in the trash compactor, black shades like famous actor
Bank account doin' gymnastics, flip
40 cal. in the Razorback starter jacket (Arkansas)
I switch up like south paw, frozen teeth look like tiger claws
Look like a pain to massage my upper bums and lower jowls (igloos)
My wedding gifts consists of Versace blend, ice out contenders, didn’t mean to offend you
When I pull up the [?], in the candy leather [?]
Flush out the system with niacin, 40 lines of the Vicodin
Still childish and violent, with appetite for violins
Disappearing act like Sister, Sister
Lost the biscuits, city slickers, rap game Billy Crystal

Pass our nuts, shit, ain’t no courtesy flush
Fuck black bitches till they bruise, white hoes till they flush
Fuck pretty bitches in their face, dick holes in their butts
Bumping mace [?]
[?] sipping more lean with Goldie
Sweaty minks in the summer like it’s snowing
Pummel all opponents turn gold if I concentrate
Scrape the plate rap for my team, bought a cheese greater
Eggplant, Parmesan with [?] seen him do a pushup on the back of his head
Acting like I’m certified, niggas get nervous when I’m walking
Nudge each other and whisper that’s him
Y’all niggas, cooch, pussies
I’mma cool off his noose on the loose sipping hooch
Flow’s out the colon, TYB chosen, bust it wide open with my staff like Moses

Have my man slap your man, man that be mandatory
Tell her lift it in her ankle for me
Real niggas in danger, need a fucking container
When I open it up, I can't fucking contain it
I've got ten toes on the pavement so why you fucking complaining?
Watch mad at my bracelet, my bracelet mad at my chain
Chain mad at my pinky so I can't wear no earrings, 2 Chainz

Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

The truth swims 
Rot away 
Without you 

Cries in vain 
Go mad 
The vague rebellion 
Cries in vain 
Ways to destroy your ambition 
Reborn 
No saving me 
Without not having anyone to blame 
I start to go crazy 
The blue empty sky and the bite mark 
Where the hell is it? 
Do you live? 

Whose fault is it that I can't trust anymore? 
The sun talks skillfully, bringing in the choice 
That look good on the outside but are just dead ends 
The body absorbs it all 
Even mercy stains the unspoken skin 
And keeps a secret of those pains that overflow 
Rot away 
Without you 

Cries in vain 
Go mad 
The vague rebellion 
Cries in vain 
Ways to destroy your ambition 
Reborn 
So what if it's fate, destroy it",Doukoku to Sarinu
Dir en Grey,"Mesmerized by those eyes with bugs crawling on them, my breathing stops
My heart calms itself
The refreshing sun mixes in with sound of the rain

My slashed heart dances, and I question in vain
The white voice, the leaking of the breath in the sun

The obscene exposure of the wound
Disappears into nothing, the wind of dogma
Your melting heart

The dark morning, echoing goodbye

My slashed heart dances, and I question in vain
I just want to be alone right now

A single season of spring, even the tearful neck and you crawling the earth

Love me

Abandon hope",Dozing Green
Dir en Grey,"These eyes opened up and understood everything 
Our battle what do you feel about this fist that shakes in anger? 
Climb over that wall 
The good and the bad have all been rooted in us 
Destruction despair 
All visible things are in vain 

No turning back 
A boon or a bane 
Every night, death opens its mouth, 
Tangles its tongue and comes for me 
No turning back 

Salute the monkey 
Salute the monkey 
The desires to combine with god 
Sex with a humanoid 

Undesired? is it not love? 
Forever abandoned 
If there're no doubts and nothing to lose, to the freedom of being born

Our battle 
What do you feel about this fist that shakes in anger? 
Climb over that wall 

Justice for dying 
What's the one that can't turn back? 
I'm tired of all the excuses 
You notice it only when the flesh gets piled up on the cart and when all sides get blocked 
The ceremonial halls are a taste of sweet honey right? 
Watching it through the glass window, you never look away 
Auschwitz goes crazy in silence 
I'll give you god 

Salute the monkey 
Salute the monkey 
The desires to combine with god 
Sex with a humanoid 

Undesired? is it not love? 
If there's not a single moment to be at lost at having no doubts and nothing to lose, to the freedom of being born 
Then the reality we must face will turn everything, even dreams into rust

Dir en Grey,"It comes and slowly stains my heart 
That's been cold, all alone and so tightly closed 
The sins are scattered everywhere 
They're around me 
I can't see it 
It vainly comes just crashing down 
In this sad and forgotten little town 
The truth we tend to look the other way from lies down deep 

I open out my wings of glass 
Up and towards the wind melted future 
So just please don't go 
Please don't go 
Be close to you 

I lay my hand on top of the heavy and closed-out door and I pray 
The lonely future left for me is one meaning of just living 
It comes and slowly stains my heart 
That's been cold, all alone and so tightly closed 
The sins are scattered everywhere 
They're around me 
I can't see it 
It vainly comes just crashing down

I open out my wings of glass 
Up and towards the wind melted future 
So just please don't go 
Please don't go 
Wanna be close to you 
I'm now forgetting even the colors of your tears and love 
So just please don't go 
Please don't go 
Holding on strong to what lies ahead 

I bleed as my way of compensating everything to you 
How heavy is blood? 
Happiness and sadness lies too close 

The hand of the child born tomorrow will be just pure and nothing else 
I can barely see you with all these tears 

I open out my wings of glass 

Up and towards the wind melted future 
So just please don't go 
Please don't go 
Wanna be close to you 
I'm now forgetting even the colors of your tears and love

And disappears along with all the wind",Glass Skin
Dir en Grey,"The morals swallowed by the waves sway inside the basket and sleeps 
The rain drops onto this earth and doesn't stop 
It keeps on hitting the ground 

Even the love that's locked inside the shell, is swallowed by the heartless beast 
What makes them do it? 
I put my hand on my heart 
The baby's first cry disappears with yesterday 

It disappears without even being able to let out a word 
Was it freedom that we won? 
Feeling the body temperature of my dreams and I pray 
My eyes shut closed 

It disappears without even being able to let out a word 
Was it freedom that we won? 
Feeling the body temperature of my dreams and I pray 
Everything gets wasted 
Deep into the red darkness 
The life I hold high and proud of",Inconvenient Ideal
Dir en Grey,"Pressing the megaphone against the apostle's open ear 
Darkness and organists are in attendance 
I press a gun against all the spectator's temple now 
And my face lets out a smile every time 
Saving 
It's prostitution to the kids who listen from the right and out the left 
Twins and seven colors of rainbow 
It can't be saved, the sorrow 
I question it all, why oh why? 
The deception of sweetly intertwining 
It's the same everywhere 
The flowing of blood mixes 
I sleep deeply 
I carve into my heart the sins 
And I live on dying 
The sakura blossoms on my wrist 
Your beloved self breeds on the corpse of the crow 
For the people on the losing end 
Is it tears of emptiness? 
Burn mercy with the National Anthem and understand death by dying 
Justice humps in the sheep yard 
What color of skin gathers behind comfort and eats? 
The earth sucks the life out and turns itself into red soil 
A piece of paper and power circles around in the air 
The show wound to head of a cow 
It's wide open 
The genitals of happiness 
The neutered almighty god",Red Soil
Dir en Grey,"You're the one that's lost now 
You shallow shit with that sad little look on your face 
Why don't you just grow yourself some wings of pity?

Lose track of where you are, all dolled up as a star? 
You make me laugh 

Suck me 
Destroy 

Even when you talk big, you do it by protecting yourself 
Suck me",Reiketsu Nariseba
Dir en Grey,"The trapped city 
Eyes fill with tears 
I slip through the alley behind the amusement city holding the child's hand and I sell 
The flesh of the fish held inside the dead fish's mouth and the bitter carnival 
Bloodstained carnival 
Without even knowing it, the good and the evil gets sucked into our lungs 
It's the short play by the Humanists 
Heil Jap 
The young souls corrode and transform back into lukewarm maggots 
Day by day we get used to it and we just take it in like medicine 
Just like those things that are genetically modified

Who throws tombstones to their ideology? 
The rose trims again, the neck of the people with their prides highly stacked

Escape 
The pain of not being able to slice off one pound of meat 
The happiness that lasts in my memory for only two days

Dir en Grey,"Who am I? 
Who stops and stands still as I entrust myself to the wind, in-between the times that are limited? 
Where is this place? 
This place that comes crushing down, all in-between those common and familiar words? 
I taint my intentions with darkness 
It's easy to stop breathing, but I just want to feel you just a little more 
Will you allow me to live? 
One bright morning, I opened my eyes and it came tears I felt like I've realized the meaning for the first time 
Don't know why, but I feel sadness when you're near me 
Why can't we become one? 
I put my hands out for those words that are too fragile, even just one 
Please give my heart something, anything like a blade sharp enough to strike you 
The emptiness of compensating 
It ripens 
Into just darkness
The shouting of the sunset 
One bright morning, I opened my eyes and it came tears I felt like I've realized the meaning for the first time 
Don't know why, but I feel sadness when you're near me 
Why can't we become one? 
I put my hands out for those words that are too fragile, even just one 
Please give my heart something, anything like a blade sharp enough to strike you 
If you just erase your memory do you think that you can change? 
If it's forgotten and changed, and you weren't you anymore 
The correct value of all things will begin to look cruel 
At least let me change what I have now into a voice 
The terms and conditions of tomorrow 
The screams are too sweet, love changes its shape 
Forgetting the pain and forgetting myself 
But now, I take it day by day with the flowing proof... 
The correct value of all things will begin to look cruel 
At least let me change what I have now into a voice 
The terms and conditions of tomorrow 

With the proof in the name of living...

Dire Straits,"Harry made a bareback rider proud and free upon a horse
And a fine coal miner for the NCB that was
A fallen angel and Jesus on the cross
A skating ballerina you should have seen her do the skater's waltz
Some people have got to paint and draw
Harry had to work in clay and stone
Like the waves coming to the shore
It was in his blood and in his bones

Ignored by all the trendy boys in London and in Leeds
He might as well have been making toys or strings of beads
He could not be in the gallery
And then you get an artist says he doesn't want to paint at all
He takes an empty canvas and sticks it on the wall
The birds of a feather all the phonies and all of the fakes

While the dealers they get together
And they decide who gets the breaks
And who's going to be in the gallery
No lies he wouldn't compromise
No junk no bits of string

And all the lies we subsidize
That just don't mean a thing
I've got to say he passed away in obscurity
And now all the vultures are coming down from the tree
So he's going to be in the gallery.",In the Gallery
Dire Straits,"Red sun go down way over dirty town
Starlings are sweeping around crazy shoals
A girl is there high heeling across the square
Wind blows around in her hair and the flaqs upon the poles
Waiting in the crowd to cross at the light
She looks around to find a face she can like

Church bell clinging on trying to get a crowd for Evensong
Nobody cares to depend to depend upon the chime it plays
They're all in the station praying for trains
Congregation late again
It's getting darker all the time these flagpole days
Drunk old soldier he gives her a fright
He's crazy lion howling for a fight

Strap hanging gunshot sound
Doors slamming on the overground
Starlings are tough but the lions are made of stone
Her evening paper is horror torn
But there's hope later for Capricorns
Her lucky stars give her just enough to get her home

Dire Straits,"She gets the sun in the daytime
Perfume in the dusk
And she comes out in the night time
With the honeysuckle musk
Because she smells just like a rose
And she tastes just like a peach
She got me walking where the wildlife goes
I'd do anything to reach her

And she was made in heaven
Heaven's in the world
Is this just expresso love
You know I'm crazy for the girl

She call me just to talk
She's my lover, she's a friend of mine
She says hey mister you wanna take a walk
In the wild west end sometime
And I get trouble with my breathing
She says boys don't know anything
But I know what I want
I want everything

Well I feel so good 'cause I feel so good
And I feel so good 'cause it feels so right
I was made to go with my girl
Like a saxophone was made to go with the night

And she can raise one eyebrow
Put her hand on my hip
And I close one eye now
Sweat on her tip
And I surrender to the fever
She love me so tender I got to believe her
Love? expresso love's alright

I don't want no sugar in it
Thank you very much
All wired up on it all fired up on it

It's just another one just like the other one

Dire Straits,"The sky is crying the streets are full of tears
Rain come down wash away my fears
And all this writing on the wall
Oh I can read between the lines
Rain come down forgive this dirty town
Rain come down and give this dirty town
A drink of water  a drink of wine

If I've been hard on you I never chose to be
I never wanted no one else
I tried my best to be somebody you'd be close to
Hand in hand like lovers are supposed to

As you'd sleep I'd think my heart would break in two
I'd kiss your cheek I'd stop myself from waking you
But in the dark you'd speek my name
You'd say baby what's wrong
Oh, here I am baby I'm coming back for more
I'm like a wave that's going to roll into the shore
Yes and if my love's in vain how come my love is so strong?

Now you and me go parallel together and apart
And you keep your perfect distance and it's tearing at my heart
Did you never feel the distance?
You never tried to cross no line
Now it's another dirty river and another dirty scar
And I don't know who's kissing you and I don't know where you are
So far from home  don't you think of me sometimes",Hand in Hand
Dire Straits,"I seen a girl on a one way corridor
Stealing down a wrong way street
For all the world like an urban toreador
She had wheels on  on her feet
Well the cars do the usual dances
Same old cruise and the kerbside crawl
But the roller girl she's taking chances
They just love to see her take them all

No fears alone at night she's sailing through the crowd
In her ears the phones are tight and the music's playing loud

Hallelujah here she comes queen roller ball
Enchante what can I say don't care at all
You know she used to have to wait around
She used to be the lonely one
But now that she can skate around town
She's the only one

No fears alone at night she's sailing through the crowd
In her ears the phones are tight and the music's playing loud
She gets rock n roll a rock n roll station
And a rock n roll dream
She's making movies on location
She don't know what it means
But the music make her want to be the story
And the story was whatever was the song what it was
Roller girl don't worry
D.j. play the movies all night long

She tortures taxi drivers just for fun
She like to read their lips
Says toro toro taxi see ya tomorrow my son
I swear she let a big truck grease her hip
She got her own world in the city
You can't intrude on her
She got her own world in the city
'cause the city's benn so rude to her

No fears alone at night she's sailing through the crowd
In her ears the phones are tight and the music's playing loud

Sing about the sixblade sing about the switchback and a torture tattoo
And I been riding on a ghost train where the cars they scream and slam
And I don't know where I'll be tonight but I'd always tell you where I am

In a screaming ring of faces I seen her standing in the light
She had a ticket for the races just like me she was a victim of the night
I put my hand upon the lever said let it rock and let it roll
I had the one arm bandit fever there was an arrow through my heart and my soul

And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above
And I'm just high on the world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love

It's just the danger when you're riding at your own risk
She said you are the perfect stranger she said baby let's keep it like this
It's just a cakewalk twisting baby step right up and say
Hey mister give me two give me two 'cause any two can play

And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above
And I'm just high on the world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love

Well it's been money for muscle another whirligig
Money for muscle another girl I dig
Another hustle just to make it big
And rockaway rockaway

And girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did
Like the spanish city to me when we were kids
Oh girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did
Like the spanish city to me when we were kids

She took off a silver locket she said remember me by this
She put her hand in my pocket I got a keepsake and a kiss
And in the roar of dust and diesel I stood and watched her walk away
I could have caught up with her easy enough but something must have made me stay

And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above
And I'm just high on the world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love

And now I'm searching through these carousels and the carnival arcades
Searching everywhere from steeplechase to palisades
In any shooting gallery where promises are made
To rockaway rockaway from Cullercoats and Whitley bay out to rockaway

Dire Straits,"Warning lights are flashing down at Quality Control
Somebody threw a spanner and they threw him in the hole
There's rumors in the loading bay and anger in the town
Somebody blew the whistle and the walls came down
There's a meeting in the boardroom they're trying to trace the smell
There's leaking in the washroom there's a sneak in personnel
Somewhere in the corridors someone was heard to sneeze
'goodness me could this be Industrial Disease?

The caretaker was crucified for sleeping at his post
They're refusing to be pacified it's him they blame the most
The watchdog's got rabies the foreman's got fleas
And everyone's concerned about Industrial Disease
There's panic on the switchboard tongues are ties in knots
Some come out in sympathy some come out in spots
Some blame the management some the employees
And everybody knows it's the Industrial Disease

The work force is disgusted downs tools and walks
Innocence is injured experience just talks
Everyone seeks damages and everyone agrees
That these are 'classic symptoms of a monetary squeeze'
On ITV and BBC they talk about the curse
Philosophy is useless theology is worse
History boils over there's an economics freeze

Sociologists invent words that mean 'Industrial Disease'
Doctor Parkinson declared 'I'm not surprised to see you here
You've got smokers cough from smoking, brewer's droop from drinking beer
I don't know how you came to get the Betty Davis knees
But worst of all young man you've got Industrial Disease'

He wrote me a prescription he said 'you are depressed
But I'm glad you came to see me to get this off your chest
Come back and see me later - next patient please
Send in another victim of Industrial Disease'
I go down to Speaker's Corner I'm thunderstruck
They got free speech, tourists, police in trucks
Two men say they're Jesus one of them must be wrong
There's a protest singer singing a protest song - he says
'they want to have a war to keep us on our knees

They want to have a war to keep their factories
They want to have a war to stop us buying Japanese
They want to have a war to stop Industrial Disease
They're pointing out the enemy to keep you deaf and blind
They want to sap your energy incarcerate your mind
They give you Rule Brittania, gassy beer, page three

Two weeks in Espana and Sunday striptease'
Meanwhile the first Jesus says 'I'd cure it soon
Abolish Monday mornings and Friday afternoons'
The other one's on a hunger strike he's dying by degrees
How come Jesus gets Industrial Disease",Industrial Disease
Dire Straits,"I hear the seven deadly sins
And the terrible twins came to call on you
The bigger they are babe
The harder they fall on you
And you you're always the same you persevere
On the same old pleasure ground
Oh and it never rains around here
It just comes pouring down

You had no more volunteers
So you got profiteers for to help you out
With friends like that babe
Good friends you had to do without
And now they've taken the chains and the gears
From off your merry-go-round
Oh and it never rains around here
It just comes pouring down

And your new romeo
Was just a gigolo when he let you down
See the faster they are babe
The faster they get out of town
Leaving make up stains and the tears
Of a clown
Yes and it never rains around here
It just comes pouring down

Oh you were just a roller coaster memory
I don't know why I was even passing through
I saw you making a date with destiny
When he came around here asking after you
In the shadow of the wheel of fortune
You're busy trying to clear your name
You say 'i may be guilty yeah that may be true
But I'd be lying if I said I was to blame
See we could have been major contenders
We never got no money no breaks'
You've got a list of all the major offenders
You got a list of all their major mistakes
And he's just standing on the shadows
Yes and you smile that come-on smile
Oh I can still hear you say as clear as the day
'I'd like to make it worth your while'

Ah but it's a sad reminder
When your organ grinder has to come to you for the rent
And all you've got to give him
Is the use of your side-show tent
Yes and that's all that remains of the years
Spent doing to rounds
And it never rains around here
Well it just comes pouring down

Now you know what they say about beggars
You can't complain about the rules
You know what they say about beggars
You know who's the first to blame his tools
You never gave a damn about who you pick up
And leave lying bleeding on the ground
You screw people over on the way up
Because you thought that you were never coming down
And he takes you out in vaudeville valley
With his hand up smothering your screams
And he screws you down in tin pan alley

Dire Straits,"A long time ago came a man on a track
Walking thirty miles with a sack on his back
And he put down his load where he thought it was the best
Made a home in the wilderness

He built a cabin and a winter store
And he ploughed up the ground by the cold lake shore
And the other travellers came walking down the track
And they never went further, no, they never went back

Then came the churches, then came the schools
Then came the lawyers, then came the rules
Then came the trains and the trucks with their load
And the dirty old track was the Telegraph Road

Then came the mines, then came the ore
Then there was the hard times, then there was a war
Telegraph sang a song about the world outside
Telegraph Road got so deep and so wide
Like a rolling river

And my radio says tonight it's gonna freeze
People driving home from the factories
There's six lanes of traffic
Three lanes moving slow

I used to like to go to work but they shut it down
I've got a right to go to work but there's no work here to be found
Yes, and they say we're gonna have to pay what's owed
We're gonna have to reap from some seed that's been sowed

And the birds up on the wires and the telegraph poles
They can always fly away from this rain and this cold
You can hear them singing out their telegraph code
All the way down the Telegraph Road

Well, I'd sooner forget, but I remember those nights
Yeah, life was just a bet on a race between the lights
You had your hand on my shoulder, you had your hand in my hair
Now you act a little colder like you don't seem to care

But just believe in me baby and I'll take you away
From out of this darkness and into the day
From these rivers of headlights, these rivers of rain
From the anger that lives on the streets with these names
'Cause I've run every red light on memory lane
I've seen desperation explode into flames
And I don't wanna see it again

From all of these signs saying ""sorry but we're closed""
All the way down the Telegraph Road",Telegraph Road

Dire Straits,"A long time ago came a man on a track
Walking thirty miles with a sack on his back
And he put down his load where he thought it was the best
Made a home in the wilderness

He built a cabin and a winter store
And he ploughed up the ground by the cold lake shore
And the other travellers came walking down the track
And they never went further, no, they never went back

Then came the churches, then came the schools
Then came the lawyers, then came the rules
Then came the trains and the trucks with their load
And the dirty old track was the Telegraph Road

Then came the mines, then came the ore
Then there was the hard times, then there was a war
Telegraph sang a song about the world outside
Telegraph Road got so deep and so wide
Like a rolling river

And my radio says tonight it's gonna freeze
People driving home from the factories
There's six lanes of traffic
Three lanes moving slow

I used to like to go to work but they shut it down
I've got a right to go to work but there's no work here to be found
Yes, and they say we're gonna have to pay what's owed
We're gonna have to reap from some seed that's been sowed

And the birds up on the wires and the telegraph poles
They can always fly away from this rain and this cold
You can hear them singing out their telegraph code
All the way down the Telegraph Road

Well, I'd sooner forget, but I remember those nights
Yeah, life was just a bet on a race between the lights
You had your hand on my shoulder, you had your hand in my hair
Now you act a little colder like you don't seem to care

But just believe in me baby and I'll take you away
From out of this darkness and into the day
From these rivers of headlights, these rivers of rain
From the anger that lives on the streets with these names
'Cause I've run every red light on memory lane
I've seen desperation explode into flames
And I don't wanna see it again

From all of these signs saying ""sorry but we're closed""
All the way down the Telegraph Road",Telegraph Road (Live) (Remix)
Dire Straits,"These mist covered mountains
Are a home now for me
But my home is the lowlands
And always will be
Someday you'll return to
Your valleys and your farms
And you'll no longer burn to be
Brothers in arms

Through these fields of destruction
Baptisms of fire
I've witnessed your suffering
As the battle raged higher
And though they did hurt me so bad
In the fear and alarm
You did not desert me
My brothers in arms

There's so many different worlds
So many different suns
And we have just one world
But we live in different ones

Now the sun's gone to hell and
The moon's riding high
Let me bid you farewell
Every man has to die
But it's written in the starlight
And every line in your palm
We are fools to make war
On our brothers in arms",Brothers in Arms
Dire Straits,"Sweet surrender on the quayside
You remember we used to run and hide
In the shadow of the cargoes I take you one time
And we're counting all the numbers down to the waterline

Near misses on the dog leap stairways
French kisses in the darkened doorways
A foghorn blowing out wild and cold
A policeman shines a light upon my shoulder

Up comes a coaster fast and silent in the nihgt
Over my shoulder all you can see are the pilot lights
No money in our jackets and our jeans are torn
Your hands are cold but your lips are warm

She can see him on the jetty where they used to go
She can feel him in the places where the sailors go
When she's walking by the river and the railway line
She can still hear him whisper
Let's go down to the waterline",Down to the Waterline

Dire Straits,"It's a mystery to me, the game commences
For the usual fee, plus expenses
Confidential information, it's a diary
This is my investigation, it's not a public inquiry

I go checking out the reports, digging up the dirt
You get to meet all sorts in this line of work
Treachery and treason, there's always an excuse for it
And when I find the reason I still can't get used to it

And what have you got at the end of the day?
What have you got to take away?

Blinds on the window and a pain behind the eyes
Scarred for life, no compensation

He's underneath the window she's singing hey la my boyfriend's back
You shouldn't come around here singing up at people like that
Anyway what you gonna do about it?

Juliet the dice were loaded from the start
And I bet and you exploded in my heart
And I forget I forget the movie song
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?

Come up on different streets they booth were streets of shame
Both dirty both mean yes and the dream was just the same
And I dreamed your dream for you and now your dream is real
How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?

When you can fall for chains of silver you can fall for chains of gold
You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
You promised me everything you promised me thick and thin
Now you just say oh Romeo yeah you know I used to have a scene with him

You said I love you like the stars above I'll love you till I die

When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong Juliet?

I can't do the talk like they talk on TV
And I can't do a love song like the way it's meant to be
I can't do everything but I'd do anything for you
I can't do anything except be in love with you

All I do is kiss you through the bars of Orion

Dire Straits,"You get a shiver in the dark,
It's a raining in the park but meantime-
South of the river you stop and you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie, double four time
You feel alright when you hear the music ring
Well now you step inside but you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain they hear the jazz go down
Competition in other places
Uh but the horns they blowin' that sound
Way on downsouth
Way on downsouth
London town
Check out guitar george, he knows-all the chords
Mind he's strictly rhythm he doesn't want to make them cry or sing
They said an old guitar is all, he can afford

When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

And Harry doesn't mind, if he doesn't, make the scene
He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright
He can play the honky tonk like anything
Savin' it up, for Friday night
With the Sultans
We're the Sultans of Swing
Then a crowd a young boys they're a foolin' around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
They don't give a damn about any trumpet playin' band
It ain't what they call rock and roll
Then the Sultans
Yeah the Sultans they play creole, creole

And then the man he steps right up to the microphone
And says at last just as the time bell rings
Goodnight, now it's time to go home

Sing about the six blade sing about the switchback and a torture tattoo
And I been riding on a ghost train where the cars they scream and slam
And I don't know where I'll be tonight but I'd always tell you where I am

In a screaming ring of faces I seen her standing in the light
She had a ticket for the races just like me she was a victim of the night
I put my hand upon the lever said let it rock and let it roll
I had the one arm bandit fever there was an arrow through my heart and my soul

And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above
And I'm just high on the world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love

It's just the danger when you're riding at your own risk
She said you are the perfect stranger she said baby let's keep it like this
It's just a cakewalk twisting baby step right up and say
Hey mister give me two give me two 'cause any two can play

And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above
And I'm just high on the world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love

Well it's been money for muscle another whirligig
Money for muscle another girl I dig
Another hustle just to make it big
And rock away rock away

And girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did
Like the Spanish city to me when we were kids
Oh girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did
Like the Spanish city to me when we were kids

She took off a silver locket she said remember me by this
She put her hand in my pocket I got a keepsake and a kiss
And in the roar of dust and diesel I stood and watched her walk away
I could have caught up with her easy enough but something must have made me stay

And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above
And I'm just high on the world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love

And now I'm searching through these carousels and the carnival arcades
Searching everywhere from steeplechase to palisades
In any shooting gallery where promises are made
To rock away rock away from Cullercoats and Whitley bay out to rock away

And girl it looks so pretty to me like it always did
Like the Spanish city to me when we were kids

You gotta be on somebody's books

Your injured looks
The sacred and profane
The pleasure and the pain
Somewhere your fingerprints remain concrete
And it's your face I'm looking for on every street

A ladykiller - regulation tattoo
Silver spurs on his heels
Says - what can I tell you, as I'm standing next to you
She threw herself under my wheels
Oh it's a dangerous road
And a hazardous load
And the fireworks over liberty explode in the heat

He's underneath the window she's singing, hey la my boyfriend's back
You shouldn't come around here singing up at people like that

Juliet the dice were loaded from the start
And I bet and you exploded in my heart

Both dirty, both mean, and the dream was just the same
And I dreamed your dream for you and your dream is real
How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals 

And you can fall for chains of silver, you can fall for chains of gold
You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
You promised me everything, yeah you promised me think and thin
Now you just says oh romeo yeah you know I used to have a scene with him

And I can't do a love song like the way it's meant to be
I can't do everything, but I'd do anything for you
I can't do anything except be in love with you

And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be
And all I do is keep the beat and bad company
And all I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme

Dire Straits,"You get a shiver in the dark
It's been raining in the park but meantime
South of the river you stop and you hold everything
A band is blowing dixie double four time
You feel all right when you hear that music ring

You step inside but you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
Too much competition too many other places
But not too many horns can make that sound
Way on downsouth way on downsouth london town

You check out guitar george he knows all the chords
Mind he's strictly rhythm he doesn't want to make it cry or sing
And an old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

And harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job he's doing alright
He can play honky tonk just like anything
Saving it up for friday night
With the sultans with the sultans of swing

And a crowd of young boys they're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
They don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call rock and roll
And the sultans played creole

And then the man he steps right up to the microphone
And says at last just as the time bell rings
'thank you goodnight now it's time to go home'
And he makes it fast with one more thing
'we are the sultans of swing'

Clocked up beneath the clouds
They're counting down to show time

And they don't give you any for pain

But if it's all for nothing

And thunder off the wall

To go up on the wall

And those who don't like the danger
Soon find something different to try
When there's only a ringin' in your ears
And an echo down memory lane

I sit and watch the convoy
Leaving town
There's no pretending I'm not a fool,
For riding around and around
Like the pictures you keep of your old wall of death
You showed me one time on the plane

But if it's all for nothing
All the roadrunning's
Been in vain

A million miles of vagabond sky
Clocked up above the clouds
I'm still your man for the roaming
For as long as there's roamin' allowed

There'll be a rider
And there'll be a wall
As long as the dreamer remains

Juliet says hey it's Romeo you nearly gimme me a heart attack
He's underneath the window she's singing hey la my boyfriend's back
You shouldn't come around here singing up at people like that
Anyway what you gonna do about it?

Juliet the dice were loaded from the start
And I bet and you exploded in my heart
And I forget I forget the movie song
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?

Come up on different streets they booth were streets of shame
Both dirty both mean yes and the dream was just the same
And I dreamed your dream for you and now your dream is real
How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?

When you can fall for chains of silver you can fall for chains of gold
You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
You promised me everything you promised me thick and thin
Now you just say oh Romeo yeah you know I used to have a scene with him

Juliet when we made love you used to cry
You said I love you like the stars above I'll love you till I die
There's a place for us you know the movie song
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong Juliet?

I can't do the talk like they talk on TV
And I can't do a love song like the way it's meant to be
I can't do everything but I'd do anything for you
I can't do anything except be in love with you

And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be
All I do is keep the beat and bad company
All I do is kiss you through the bars of orion

Dire Straits,"I am Jeremiah Dixon
I am a Geordie boy
A glass of wine with you, sir
And the ladies I'll enjoy
All Durham and Northumberland
Is measured up by my own hand
It was my fate from birth
To make my mark upon the earth

He calls me Charlie Mason
A stargazer am I
It seems that I was born
To chart the evening sky
They'd cut me out for baking bread
But I had other dreams instead
This baker's boy from the west country
Would join the Royal Society

We are sailing to Philadelphia
A world away from the coaly Tyne
Sailing to Philadelphia
To draw the line
A Mason-Dixon Line

Now you're a good surveyor, Dixon
But I swear you'll make me mad
The West will kill us both
You gullible Geordie lad
You talk of liberty
How can America be free
A Geordie and a baker's boy
In the forests of the Iroquois

Now hold your head up, Mason
See America lies there
The morning tide has raised
The capes of Delaware
Come up and feel the sun
A new morning has begun
Another day will make it clear
Why your stars should guide us here

We are sailing to Philadelphia
A world away from the coaly Tyne
Sailing to Philadelphia
To draw the line
A Mason-Dixon Line",Sailing to Philadelphia
Dire Straits,"We're taking on water diesel and stores
Laying up awhile before I'm back on board
They're patching her up to go fishing again
 
They're welding her rudder scrubbing her keel
Scars on her belly need time to heal
In the dock with the trawler men
 
I know all the people there's nobody new
Soon we'll be leaving with the same old crew
On the green water the tumbling sea
 
They ain't running like the good old days
Time's just slipping down the old slipways
In the dock so dear to me
 
Dark is the night
I need a guiding light to keep me
From foundering on the rocks
 
My only prayer 
Is just to see you there at the end
Of my wandering back in the dock
 
I could use a layoff getting my strength back
But there's a loan to pay off and a few skip jack
So it's a turnaround back in the southerly wind
 
Pirates coming in to steal our gold
You can count yourself lucky with a profit in the hold
In the dock when we come in
 
Dark is the night
I need a guiding light to keep me
From foundering on the rocks
 
My only prayer
Is just to see you there at the end
Of my wandering
Back in the dock",The Trawlerman's Song
Dire Straits,"The drinking dens are spilling out
There's staggering in the square
There's lads and lasses falling about
And a crackling in the air

Down around the dungeon doors
The shelters and the queues
Everybody's looking for
Somebody's arms to fall into

   And it's what it is
It's what it is now

There's frost on the graves and the monuments
But the taverns are warm in town
People curse the government
And shovel hot food down

The lights are out in city hall
The castle and the keep
The moon shines down upon it all
The legless and asleep

And it's cold on the tollgate
With the wagons creeping through
Cold on the tollgate
God knows what I could do with you
It's what it is
It's what it is now

The garrison sleeps in the citadel
With the ghosts and the ancient stones
High up on the parapet
A Scottish piper stands alone

And high on the wind
The highland drums begin to roll
And something from the past just comes
And stares into my soul

And it's cold on the tollgate
With the Caledonian blues
Cold on the tollgate
God knows what I could do with you

And it's what it is
It's what it is now
What it is
It's what it is now

There's a chink of light, there's a burning wick
There's a lantern in the tower
Wee Willie Winkie with a candlestick
Still writing songs in the wee wee hours

On Charlotte Street I take
A walking stick from my hotel

Is still in search of Little Nell

Come to rescue me

Cast away the chains away behind
Take away my pain, my darling pretty

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past

Oh! Will you never set me free?

An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables

The beauty that is Spring's

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

How strange how sweet to find you still

Like the kicker in a julep or two

Can't you see that it never can be?

No one's willing to provide you
When you're eager to consume
But you'll grow up, it's not that bad
You think of feelings you once had
And although the memories fade
Certain things remain

[Chorus:]
And it's you that keeps me lonely
And it's you that brings me home
It's you that left me out here on my own
On my own

And I was just a child
I invested all I had
In a love that felt like fire, oh
With a boy and not a man
I swore I'd never love again
That my heart would never mend

[Chorus:]

And you know I got a lot
I'm a friend and I'm a lover
And I've moved on from what we had
And it's safe to say that I wish you well
'Cause I don't hold a grudge no more

[Chorus:]

Yes, it's you that makes me careful
'Cause it's you that breaks my heart
It's you that made me tough and twice as smart
And you know I got a lot
I'm a friend and I'm a lover
And I've moved on from what we had
And it's safe to say that I wish you well
'Cause I don't hold a grudge no more",Lonely
Dirtie Blonde,"Set aside your mind, your mind
Be forgiving and kind
Is it all worthwhile? Tonight, tonight
I'm here for you

[Chorus:]
And I feel like a child again
I never knew I'd take it this far
Try to hide the pain
But I never knew, he'd jeopardize my pride

In my life, I tried, I try
To take it all with a stride
But I feel like I 
Just this time
Must step aside

[Chorus:]

It wears me out
Don't pressure me about it
He brings you down
You know it, so come on
I can't be a part
Of his communism 
And it stops for me today
Okay?
Say goodbye to me tonight
Cause it's over this time
He's like a bridge on fire
And you, and you
Your own demise

And I feel like a child again
I never knew I'd take it this far
Try to hide the pain 
But I never knew you'd jeopardize
My pride",My Pride
Dirtie Blonde,"I know I tell you all the time
It's always on my mind
So understand when I 
Try to find the words to say
Don't want to be cliche
A cheesy serenade
Don't you know you've been 
The only thing that matters to me
Don't you know you've been
The only one who truly believes

[Chorus]
Don't let me down
I'm officially in love with you now
I got everything to lose
Times they may change
But if you would be my steady baby
I promise I'll do right by you
Right by you

People think they understand 
But they don't stand a chance
They couldn't if they tried
You're neurotic just like me
Making sure I eat
You barely save a dime 
Don't you know I've been alone 
With the exception of you
And if anything, that's true

[Chorus]

Officially in love
I'm officially in love

[Chorus 2x]",Officially in Love
Dirtie Blonde,"Baby, you know I love you
More than I ever did
Baby, you pull me in slowly
But smooth like a cigarette
And every time that it gets cold out
You're right there by my side
You know you're my favorite distraction
My favorite waste of time

[Chorus:]
You let my lose my mind
I want you all the time
I'll keep you satisfied
Just don't get outta my bed
All the time
Just one more taste
And I'm not feeling quite as shy
Just don't get outta my bed

In the morning when I wake up
And I'm feeling all alone
All I gotta do is roll over
And you're there with bells on
And now my mama told me not to touch that stuff
But she don't take her advice
And baby, you're the one who gives me all my love
And keeps me feeling twice as nice

[Chorus:]

I can't get you off of my back 

[Chorus:]",Outta My Bed
Dirtie Blonde,"You say that you're leaving
But I've heard those words before
And I won't play these games
You say that your reason
Is life has got to offer more
And every day's the same
And I do feel offended
Why don't you just say
What you really mean
Or...

[Chorus:]
Shut up, you don't love me, baby
'Cause if you did, if you did
I would know
Shut up, you don't love me, baby
'Cause if you did, if you did
Then it would show
Shut up, you don't love me, baby
'Cause if you did, if you did
You wouldn't go

The days go by slowly
Each more painful than the last
I try to understand 
I got my defenses
Up so high it's sad, but I
Have always had a man
And I guess that it's over
So...

[Chorus:]

I saved you, boy
You know I did
I took your crooked life
And I straightened it for you
I held you up so very high
And you can't take back what you said
It's real this time

[Chorus: Repeat 3X]",Shut Up
Dirtie Blonde,"Strength, I never had much strength
When it came to loving him
Change, I don't do well with change
Can't decipher what is real
I failed to show you how I truly feel
And now you're going, and I can't deal

So stay, for me
What do I know?
I'm a make believer
I'm a tyrant
But I'd treat you right this time

You, you always take the punches
You accept it as it comes
And I am good when I am good
But when I'm bad, I'm overbearing and I know
You do the best you can
Hardly feeling like a man

[Chorus:]
Throw me down, hit my face, break my back
'Cause I can take the physical pain
Belittle me in front of a crowd
Tell 'em I'm only really half of myself
when they're around
Tell 'em I'm even scared of the dark,
I stay up all night
With the weight of the world on my shoulders
Tell 'em I hold the pain of a girl that never was real
A girl that you, you never even knew

Oh, I guess I've really done it 
You won't look me in the eye
No, don't tell me that it's over
I won't cry, but I will wither up inside
And never be the same
And I'm the only one to blame

[Chorus]",Stay
Dirtie Blonde,"I can't go to sleep
I lie in bed awake and wired, trying desperately
But I'm not counting sheep
I'm listening to the music in my head so constantly
'Cause I rely on it
To take me far, oh, so financially
And I'm depriving him
Of all my time and all my energy
And all this time, I slave away
It will happen someday
And all you got to do is say 
What you want

[Chorus:]
So what you want?
What you want for me to say?
All I ever do is try for you
Oh baby I'm ready
What you want?
Try to take it day by day
But I need some kind of sign from you
I'm giving you plenty
If you need, I could throw it in your face
Write a song that's undeniable
So steady, I'm ready 
What you want? 
I could be the one you want
I could be the one you want

Don't lose faith in me
I'm about to execute with true simplicity
I'll make you tap your feet
Make you hum the words as you are walking down the street
'Cause I rely on you
To get it now or never, see'est la vie
And it's a time to start anew
Show that this is what I want to be
And all the times I slaved away
They will pay off someday
And all you got to do is say
What you want

[The Pimp]
I'm comin' hard with this killa game
And I'ma make 'em all realize that they about to be broke
Young shawty it's a pimp in the air
And if you really didn't care, what you callin' me for
It's all about the game that I kick
To get inside her head and make her want to lick on it quick
The silly trick suck it up like a tick
The average playa don't understand what the Pimp be gamin' her with
Don't give a damn who you claimin' you with
Because I know you in love every time I see yo pretty brown eye contacts
I got you grippin' yo seat
Cause I know you plan to sweat girl every time I see ya smile back
I ain't pretty or nothin' 
But still I got enough game to back it all up when I leave
I got another trick up my sleave
I'm killin' 'em softly every time I get 'em down on they knees
I know you want these N-you-T's
Cause I do a lot of shows and you think I got plenty cash
Saw a bunch of girls in the past
So I'm only chillin' with pretty chickens that ? keep a pretty stash
So you know I ain't finna pass
A pretty opportunity to get them girls sprung with the tongue
So tell the freaky trick I'm finna come
So watch me ??

Now it ain't nothin' but the freak in me 
To spit this game and make yo broad want to sleep with me
See I know you want to creep with me
I got a fifth of that Hennessy and some killa that'll weaken yo knees
Dirty skeez won't you freeze at ease
And drop to the beat
Or better yet won't you lay on yo back
But you need to stop teasin' me
By squeezin' me and just let my finger get to workin' with that
You know the game that I'm kickin' is fat
I met you last night and I already got the game in check
When you heard my words
I struck a bloody nerve
I see the way I got you jumpin' when I'm kissin' yo neck
Don't be afraid of them playa effects
Silly whoa don't you know that my game got you goin' for broke
So when you choke off that contact smoke
I got that game to break you down and plus a lil' some for yo throat
And when I'm done I'm ready to go
I'm walkin' out yo do'
I leave ya down butt-naked on the flo'
Understand that you messin' with a pro
When this night is over ain't no need for you to call me no mo'
Cause I'm headed to the next show
To get the next whoa to scheme her outta all her dough
y'all know what I came here fo'
A playa from the South spittin' true thang run 'em low
I want to be yo Candy-nigga

Now let me tell ya what it means to me
I'll show you what you really need to see
If you come sleep with me

[The Pimp]
Now look here shawty called me up when he leave
I'll come on over beat you down all night to this song
You know the situation so wrong
Me creepin' and sneakin' up in yo house when yo man leave home
But this gator head on bone
You makin' it worse because you babblin' about yo thong
Boostin' me up on the phone
To come on in and creep what I can
And then I dash on
I got yo mind - oooh it's so blown
You know that it's gone
I bend you over headfirst to the floor
Girl I got the keys to yo door
You know you do understand when I lay you down I gotta go
You know what I came here for
So don't be trippin' when I come try to claim you don't know
We finna make a flick trick
So get on yo knees
We gon' call it ""Strip Deep Throat 4""
And to all the whoas that don't know
You need to stop teasin' and let a playa just splash in them hips
You need to lick around on the tip

Dirty,"(Spoken by the Gangsta)
Hmmph! A dedication to all them homeboys a
Nd all them homegirls out there that done passed away
Dirty boys dedicate this rhyme to you 
That let you know how much love we got for you.
So from here on out let your soul have a peceful journey
One love!

(Pimp)
Now I got love for my homies who done shed blood for my homies
In the night sometimes I wish I coulda took slugs for my homies
But they gone now and you better believe I cried my tears 
Maybe the way y'all died it'll make me change the life I live
Like my homie Juwan Tobin raised in the village of guilt 
It's like the whole world stopped spinning my boy when you got killed
And Rico Maye...maaan why you had to depart
I remember riding our bikes around Cedar Park until it got dark
And found lil' shot up Jordan they found your body parked in the car 
I know you watching over your son from up above in the stars
An ole shocking Scott I know you where the angels stay 
Cause with fluid on your lungs you died in the strangest way
You was my second cousin so I miss you every day
The beautifullest thing in this world to see your smiiling face
And Fred and Isaac damn I hate y'all died like that
Taking slugs in your back cause your truck got jacked
But lil' Isaac boy I wish you woulda had on a vest
And until this day I know your soul holdin' down the crest
And Peanut and Beesy both of y'all died for some girls
Yo' mama brought you here but haters took you out of this world
And Damon Frank from here on out we gonna hold your name down
The love you had for Hundred Station, Smiling Coat and Gumptown
And lil' Poony your soldier name was Eddie Hell
And all my thugs in Riverside gave you the truest fairwell
And that's for real!

[Chorus(both)]
Now some people come and some people go
But how you leave this world young playa don't nobody know
I see your chest up out the casket not on the floor
I'm asking my Lord the same ole questions why you had to go
Now everytime I hit that wood I blow smoke in the sky
I know you closer to cloud 9 my boy so go on and get high
I see your mama shaking her head and wiping her tears from her eyes
I'm asking my Lord the same ole questions why you had to die

(Gangsta)
It's been a struggle everyday just trying to fight to survive
It's like the Gump ain't been the same since my homies done died
Now Torio that was my boy since elementary days
I blow smoke for you in the air every time I get blazed
When Meatball took that fall I just couldn't even cope
The last time I seen my boy was down in juvenile court
I tell my players hold your head and keep your glock by your side
Don't be scared to up and bust when they testin' your pride
Juwan Turner got killed man I can't take it no more
I might be wrong but I don't think it was my homie time to go
When lil' Junior died the Westside got out of control
We miss that brother soul how much he'll never know
Oh and reminiscing on my boy lil' Khatto 
I know you in that paradise cause that's where all the g's go
Pour out some liquor for my homies no I'm spitting these rhymes
Cause pouring out some alcohol can't tell you how I feel inside

The days that we spent without your presence around
For all them players who didn't make it we gonna hold this thing down
Until we meet again homies cause it ain't gonna be here
I guess I'll see y'all in the heavens where all the real g's live
And that's for real

(Chorus)
Now some people come and some people go
But how you leave this world young playa don't nobody know
I see your chest up out the casket not on the floor
I'm asking my Lord the same ole questions why you had to go
Now every time I hit that wood I blow smoke in the sky
I know you closer to cloud 9 my boy so go on and get high
I see your mama shaking her head and wiping her tears from her eyes
I'm asking the Lord the same ole questions why you had to die

(Pimp)
Now as I walk through the valley with the shadows of death
My homies gone so I'm walkin this valley all by myself
We miss our boy lil' Willie so much he was like a brother to us
I know you watching the world telling God how tight we was
You might be gone but you ain't dead I feel your soul by my side
Asking me to check on your grandma to make sure she's alright 
I know it ain't nothing I can say right now that can bring your life back
I don't even hate the boy who killed you I'm gonna let God handle that
Cause who am I.....
To judge a man for his sin and his faith
The only thing I can do for Willie right now is change my ways
It's gonna be hard cause I'm a young playa that loves to get paid
Until that day I'm gonna pimp whores until I go to my grave

(Gangsta)
Now as I sit and reminisce upon my boy and all the things we been through 
Who knew this early in our lifetime that the Lord would choose you
How can I make this pain I can't take itit's breaking me down inside 
I'm asking the Lord to bless your soul as I wipe the tears from my eyes
I find it hard continuing life without you walking this earth
I guess we all gonna have to face death as an answer for birth
But where you're resting now you're free from all these criminal minds
I can't lie I'm kinda glad you're free from these struggling times
But yet and still I don't understand why you had to go so soon
My deepest sympathy goes to your family for your loss was a harsh wound
So Rest In Peace lil Willie Dickerson another homie to mourn
But I can't wait until Judgement Day when all our souls can rejoin

(Chorus)
Now some people come and some people go
But how you leave this world young playa don't nobody know
I see your chest up out the casket not on the floor
I'm asking my Lord the same ole questions why you had to go
Now every time I hit that wood I blow smoke in the sky 
I know you closer to cloud 9 my boy so go on and get high
I see your mama shaking her head and wiping her tears from her eyes
I'm asking the Lord the same ole questions why you had to die

Let's ride, let's ride, let's ride
Sho nuff
Let's ride, let's ride

I'm Mr. Everyday Chiefer
Full of herb
And this killer ass reefer got a nigga feeling swozy
I'm slowly, creepin' up through the hood
And I see my niggas, and the smoking real good
So show a nigga love, what up kinfolk
And while you at my nigga, won't you past the dope
You know a nigga has to choke
Of killer both for me, I got the smoke flowing down my throat
So playa won't you ride with me
We can get quizzer in the front of my drop top Caddy
With my heat just ready to skeet
So playa please don't drop no fire on my feet
But it's all good, cause it's much love
And I got my mind twisted off kind bud
I'm screaming out Dirty thug
Sipping on the Cognac with the hardest buzz
So tell me what it was
What it be like
Mr. G living up to this gangster life
And it's got me on a flight higher than a kite
And my eyes real low so I have no sight
I'm feeling really right as I keep flow, through the sky
Way past cloud number nine
Chiefing all the time, blazing on an ounce
Cause I just can't make it with a nickel or a dime
Everything looking fine in the Gump city
Girls walk around short skirts on looking pretty
You can tell the thugs from the sedity
All the high-class girls always acting nitty
But showing no pity, in the land
Of blunt passing
Niggas be everlasting
Where Mr. G gone blaze the weed 
Until I'm dead and gone off in my casket

[Chorus]
Now take a trip in my 'Lac with me
We can patch in 
You can go half on a sack with me
We can find a freaky slut to beat
And if it come down to it
We can bust our heat in the street
See, it don't really matter
Long as I'm down for you
And you down for me
We can ride together, forever
Rolling through the streets of the G-you-M-P

It ain't nothing like riding the track, rocking the show
Making the crowd get hype, letting them know
Is you ready to wild out, I'm bout to flow
Got you peeping the style out, as I go
Now should I drop the game on them hoes
Now do you really understand 
How the pimp game goes
It's all about money and hoes
Keep us in it, with your mind froze
And slamming Cadillac doors

Now I'm a ride on the track
Giving you something that you can feel
Better buckle up before you go, haters hit the door
Cause we be hitting you with the skills
Don't give up before you flow, I'm a let you know
That my adrenaline assembling
That's enough to have a emcee trembling
Just give me the mic and them Frank Benjamin's
And call the paramedic, I'm about to injure men
Finish him, ain't many left to cope
Hearts stopped beating, listen to this stethoscope
So many emcees getting' left for broke
And try to make a comeback, shoulda kept the joke
Khao be the name, try dissin' me
Your history, your absence a mystery
Dried your game up like an antihistamine
Put that on Big Pimp and Mr. G
This'll be, something that people can ride to
Laid back, track cool like Rallo
Hit after hit we follow
Wanted to nibble and bit off way more than you can swallow
Why'all must be drunk off the bottle
Hating on us, don't talk, bring yourself to me
I don't need nobody helping me
I'm about to lyrically burn a brother to the twelfth degree
What why'all want to do now, huh
Humiliated, didn't know, Krumbsnatchaz affiliated
With Dirty, came up and really made it
All these cats want to be down with us
I really hate it, but illustrated, the picture
It takes skills to grab the mic
And keep it tight, some want, simplified:
Some had it, some got it
Some wish they did, and some don't

It ain't nothing like riding the track, rocking the show
Making the crowd get hype, letting them know
Is you ready to wild out, I'm bout to flow
Got you peeping the style out, as I go

[Chorus]

Now should I drop the game on them hoes
Now do you really understand 
How the pimp game goes
It's all about money and hoes
Keep us in it, with your mind froze
And slamming Cadillac doors

Now let me take you to the land where the riders see
Pardon me shorty
Let me introduce you to my pimp psychology
Let a young nigga hold if you down with a holla at me
Now follow me, to my '98 'Lac outside
Now is she ready to ride
Slip cover your eyes, it's a surprise
I'll be obliged if you slide where them Dirty boys hide
And I was hypnotized when a young playa saw (um,um)
Your pretty brown eyes
And I apologize if I came to hard
Trying to get between your, sugar brown thighs
You know the pimp hide
And it's twelve o'clock tonight
I got late night lust
We need to, bring a pen and pad
And keep count (keep count) 
Of the nuts I bust (I bust)
I'm swerving, looking through my rear view nervous
While your head steady working
And your neck steady jerking
Up on your knees in my seat
And your lips steady slurping
I don't just kill a knob
And I know your mouth finna' throb
And baby if you could
Shine and rob with your tongue
Like old Inga Shywood (Shywood), situation all good
I love the way you got straight to it 
And plus I love the way you do it
I wouldn't take nothing from you
Girl you's a true headhunter
Booger-lips turner
You must have got it from you mother
Now look up in the sky, it's a pimp in the air
So freaky bitches better beware
I got your mind, mega blown
With the game that I spit
And keep them freaky bitches horny as hell

Now should I drop the game on them hoes
Now do you really understand 
How the pimp game goes
It's all about money and hoes
Keep us in it, with your mind froze
And slamming Cadillac doors

It ain't nothing like riding the track, rocking the show
Making the crowd get hype, letting them know
Is you ready to wild out, I'm bout to flow
Got you peeping the style out, as I go

Ahh
Sho nuff, sho nuff
In my 'Lac with me
On a sack with me
Ahh
Drop the game on them hoes",Ride
Dirty,"[Chorus]
While riding in my Cadillac
What to my surprise

Young shawty I'm the pimp, so you know my game cold
Brush all my teeth cause my whole grill gold
Step out my house, pink gators on my toes
Tryna hit tha club before they all close
Hop in the Lac, Fleetwood eight four
Twenty inch G's with tha triple gold spokes
Creep in the door with my pockets on swole
Limp across tha flo like both of my legs broke
Slide to tha bar to get me somn cold
Got a glass of Thunderbird cause I can't stay in mode
Put down my glass and hit tha dance flo
Don't get mad at me boy what you cuffin' my hands for
If I want it I'ma get it ya know how my game go
? I'm pullin ya main woe
I'm chargin' for this game, I'm givin' you lames yos
Gotta line these girls up in a soul train row
I hit tha V.I.P. just to get my mind blown
Do I see Mista G he got that fire dro
All tha hataz in tha club what ya rollin' ya eyes fo
Cause ya mad I'm pushin' good and pimped out tha side door

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Now when I hop off in tha Lac, I swerve tha interstate
Just because I'm cheifin' dro and I'm smugglin' heavy weigh
Keep tha hood bout my G's and break um off a K
And sip on Hennessy till I start to hallucinate
Pull my way down tha block cause its mo money to make
And plus I got some mo cookie dough I need to bake
But you can buy a bag of mine and I betcha you gon' be straight
Cause tha soft ain't got no cut and tha wood ain't got no shape
Cause tha fiends run to me whenever they want to taste
Cause they say that mine taste like baked potato and steak
Well excuse me if I done took all yo pay
Cause I just set up shop and been workin' for one day
You say you want to rob me, well hell that's a mistake
Cause I got atomic bombs that cause tha Earth to quake
It'll open all tha gates and cause heaven to shake
It not God man its me, cause I destroyed tha place
All because of this devious busta who tried to hate
When all he had to do was ask, instead he tried to take
So to stop all of that and keep my soul safe
I just hop in my Lac and head tha other way

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

It's about 2:45 and we at tha red light
Looked in my mirror, and saw some head lights
Now any other time it would be aight
But tha group done checked around when ya on tha westside
Put my foot to tha flo, doin' bout eighty five
Hit Fairview, headed to Riverside
They behind us kinda close, so hell I bust a ride
Ran on tha curb and scrubbed my damn tire
Man can't you mash tha gas and dash up outta sight
What ya talkin' 'bout, I'm doin' a bill five
I could pick up mo speed on a ten speed bike
Oh you tryna joke, better hope we don't die
Since we ain't packin gats it seems we gotta fight
When I throw a left, you best to throw a right
Pull up in tha cut so they can pass us by
Get down in yo seat and get off tha brake light
They pulled up in tha back and blocked us from behind
He was laughin' so hard it sounded like a crime
He said listen heyah Dirty, why you tryna hide
I was just tryna tell ya Cadillac is tight

[Chorus:Repeat x2]",My Cadillac [Main Version]
Dirty,"Bitch I been a ""G"" all my life
A ""G"" down to ride
""G's"" stay getting high
I'm a ""G"" 'til I die
A nigga known to bust gats
Take half a day to skeet crack
I represent the slum
Gangsta body dipped in all black
Don't act like you ain't know that
My clique is quick to go at
Any of why yall prankstas, why yall ain't gangstas
Why yall just throwbacks
Put slugs to yo brain
Thuggin' blood's in my vein
The ghetto version of Norman Bates
Thug in the same
So ask about me
Porno with six stars
So don't doubt me
And niggas who ain't gangsta
Stay the fuck away from round me
I got dope in every county
Fuckin' bitches that's a ?
They call me that boy Nutty
Ain't no nigga finna clown me
Shit, I haul off and kidnap yo whole family
Strap up a bomb and kill every one for testing me
So when I go I'm taking all my folks
So when we hit hell, we still can go to war
That's gangsta!

[Chorus]
Now if you catch me with a OZ
Ridin' 4 deep in a Caprice
Hollin' fuck the police motherfucker
You in the hood everyday
Same clothes tryin' ta skeet a pound of dro' motherfucker
You in the feds gotta do 5 years
Just because you wouldn't squeal motherfucker
You got kids to feed
They gotta live even if you have to kill motherfucker

Now Lil Burn-One's the nigga hoe hoppin, dro' copin', gun toter
Wool club loader, 4-5 in the holster
And its the take over
I'm shaking these bitches from off my cock
And these haters up off my shoulder
Claiming gangsta but you so coward
Talking bout trepos
Sissy ass bitch then take yo ass to Chuck Wilder
Women's prison and you still probably won't last for a hour
You a nigga scared to death you gon' get raped in the shower
By 6 dikes slapping yo ass with towels
You'll probably move yo bowels
You'll probably piss on yourself and crumble like a ball of powder
See we fo sho' folk, 9-7 four-door
Black Game claiming throwing signs out the window
We keep it all ""G"", since elementary
We represented from the block to penitentiary
Make em remember me, Burn one the O.G
I'm going out black clothes out, fro'd out, that's Gangsta!


[Chorus]
He just asked me ""Pimp why you bangin' my trick?""
Hoes tell that nigga my name
Frank Dingaling bitch
I'm that fat daddy hall
Fifth of Hen, hydro, bull dagger and her friend
I'm a fat nasty dog
I make these hoes crawl
Plus I'm gangsta bought
Bust at my enemy
Plus I'm in they main girl draws
You ain't no kin to me
So nigga keep my name out yo mouth
You talkin' shit I'll cock this trigga bitch and run in yo house
And lay you down
Let me come into your house
So piss on the ground
Cock this pistol into your mouth
And don't make a sound
There's no way in and there's no way out
So bring me your gat
I'm bumping New Edition's ""Candygirl""
When Ronnie, Bobby, Ricky, and Mike had a curl
That's gangsta
You heard gangstas make the world turn round
Well shit's gon' continue popping while fire burn on the ground
Now that's gangsta!

(Chorus)
While riding in my Cadillac
What to my surprise..

(Verse 1)
Young shawty I'm the pimp, so you know my game cold
Brush all my teeth cause my whole grill gold
Step out my house, pink gators on my toes
Tryna hit tha club before they all close
Hop in the Lac, Fleetwood eight four
Twenty inch G's with tha triple gold spokes
Creep in the door with my pockets on swole
Limp across tha flo like both of my legs broke
Slide to tha bar to get me somn cold
Got a glass of Thunderbird cause I can't stay in mode
Put down my glass and hit tha dance flo
Don't get mad at me boy what you cuffin my hands for
If I want it I'ma get it ya know how my game go
? I'm pullin ya main woe
I'm chargin for this game, I'm givin you lames yos
Gotta line these girls up in a soul train row
I hit tha V.I.P. just to get my mind blown
Do I see Mista G he got that fire dro
All tha hataz in tha club what ya rollin ya eyes fo
Cause ya mad i'm pushin good and pimped out tha side door

(Chorus 2X)
While riding in my Cadillac
What to my surprise..

(Verse 2)
Now when I hop off in tha Lac, I swerve tha interstate
Just because I'm cheifin dro and i'm smugglin heavy weigh
Keep tha hood bout my G's and break um off a K
And sip on Hennessy till I start to hallucinate
Pull my way down tha block cause its mo money to make
And plus I got some mo cookie dough I need to bake
But you can buy a bag of mine and I betcha you gon' be straight
Cause tha soft ain't got no cut and tha wood ain't got no shape
Cause tha fiends run to me whenever they want to taste
Cause they say that mine taste like baked potato and steak
Well excuse me if I done took all yo pay
Cause I just set up shop and been workin for one day
You say you want to rob me, well hell that's a mistake
Cause I got atomic bombs that cause tha Earth to quake
It'll open all tha gates and cause heaven to shake
It not God man its me, cause I destroyed tha place
All because of this devious busta who tried to hate
When all he had to do was ask, instead he tried to take
So to stop all of that and keep my soul safe
I just hop in my Lac and head tha other way

(Chorus 2X)
While riding in my Cadillac
What to my surprise..

(Verse 3)

Dirty,"[Chorus]
I put 24 inches on the Brougham
Call my baddest bitch and tell her daddy comin' home
Pull up at the light and them thangs keep spinnin'
I'm bustin' down a Philly, finna fill it with a 20
That liquor got me swervin', E&J is what we sippin'
Just pulled it out the shop, so that paint still drippin'
Got that thang flip-flop, so the flop keep flippin'
Keep that 45 cock when I'm woodgrain grippin'

[Verse 1:  Big Pimp]
I woke up Friday morning, right before I washed my ass
My nigga Keke called me, told me ""Boy, come get your Lac""
I'm happy as hell cause I been waitin' for the call
He told me that he sprayed it last night with stone wall
""You got 31 Flavors, and boy you need to see'em
But you need you some rims, so meet me down at Emmet Neil's
And Pimp while you thinkin', I'mma tell you how to kill her
Take off them Gary Payton's and sit that bitch on Andre Miller's""
I call up LaKiera, that's my main thoroughbred
Cause right 'fore I hit her, I get some flame-thorough-head
Now when she suck it, she don't play when she catch it
Could it be I run with J and Scarface down in Texas?
But I'm down in Alabama where the ballers love flexin'
Keep my 45 cocked just in case I feel threatened
I pulled up at the light and them hoes almost fainted
I hearin' screamin' out, hollerin' ""Keke must'a painted it""
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:  G-stacka]
I'm choppin' down your block in a big body Brougham
Candy flip-flop, 24 inch chrome
Spinnin' like four windmills, enough to give off wind chills
And all this dro smoke is startin' to fog up my windshield
I'm sittin' more high than four deers, stacked on top of four hills
And if I sip 'bout four beers, I'll need four blunts to straight kill
I'll show you how that bass feel, four 15's off in the rear
Beatin' so hard off in your ear, when you get out you can hardly hear
Mix E&J with Belvedere, so my mind ain't never clear
My 4-5 been with me so goddamn long feel like my souvenir
You want to know what's truly real? How many times my candy flip
The sun make my paint look like a fruity bag of M&M's
Hoes love the way it drip, so they holla ""Let me ride""
So it's me and Pimp with 'bout twenty-four hoes inside, every night
Takin' flight, in my Fleetwood full of hood freaks
And if that thang is candy paint, it must got sprayed my Keke

[Chorus]


[Verse 3:  Both]
(In singing-rap style)

[Big Pimp] We push Caddies with gold spokes, vogues with mo-mo
[G-stacka] They sit high, they sit low, 20's and 24's
[Big Pimp] We got hoes that dike hoes, suck dick, and snort blow
[G-stacka] We got niggas that smoke dro, push bricks, and elbows
[Big Pimp] Thirty-one clear coats drip wet like Mop 'n Glow
[G-stacka] Spinners that chop fast, spinners that chop slow
[Big Pimp] Gators of all soles, furs, and perm fros
[G-stacka] We ride with 44's that's tucked off in our clothes

Dirty,"Woooh
Now this one right here feel good
Uh, let it play for a minute..
Oh, I ain't got that much time?
Check this out..
To all my niggas out there, that know they'e gangsta
Even though you ain't got no ring on your finger
But it's always the one bitch... I mean one woman
If you got nineteen hoes, it's always that one
You'll die for

I'm on my knees screamin' ""Baby I apologize""
'Cause I don' hurt you so much, I know you tire of cryin'
You was there every Sunday when I was doin' time
And sent a letter every Monday just to ease my mind
To let a nigga know that pussy cat was still mine
And bought you two fat dildos just to kill time
The fact that I'm... on the other side of this glass
I realize... just exactly what a nigga had
You stayed wit' me... even though I used to spank that ass
Didn't hesitated wit' me... any time I needed cash
A many days I was stressed out and feelin' bad
You laid me down on my chest and massaged my back
And plenty days you don' cooked, and I never came home
Collard greens, macaroni & cheese, and neckbone
Po'kchop, sweet potato pie up out the stove so hot
I know I'm pimpin' right now, but baby one day this pimp gon' stop
I know I was crazy baby I had you out there slangin' rocks
But I'm out now so face it baby I gotta hit the block
What you talkin' 'bout? Hell yeah I love you and it ain't gon' stop
I always said I wan'nt gon' do it again but I never stop
But I did you so wrong - that's the purpose for this song
I didn't mean to break your heart but now our love is on the run
Run-run-run-run, fuss-n-fightin'
What's done is what's done, let bygones be bygones
And you was there - to console when I lost my homey
And you was there - to give me head anytime I was ho'ny/horny
And you was there - when my eyes was on the verge of cryin'
And you was there - when I was on the verge of dyin'
So how the fuck I fixed my mouth to call you a bitch
If you was bitchin', it's probably 'cause I got you pissed
This on my life, since them wife folks ain't givin' me life
When I get out, promise to God I'mma make you my wife

I need a gangsta wife
Wife-wife(yea-e-yea-ah), wife-wife(o-ooo-oh)
A gangsta wife(Say that's all I need...), down to ride(...in my life)
Wife-wife(is a gangsta wife...), wife-wife(...by my side)
A gangsta wife(yeah), down to ride(oooooh yeah)

Shawty, I know it's been hard on ya the past couple of years
You shed so many tears, wonderin' if my love is real
To show you how I feel, hell I mostly pay the bills
Hustle up on drug deals, so we can get a hot meal
I'm from the streets, so the streets don' made me how I is
I know I'm in them day and night, but that's just how I live
So ain't no need to fuss and fight, wit' you all in my grill
'Cause if I ain't want you, best believe that I wouldn't be here
Got some issues, best believe that we gon' get clear
'Cause you been down wit' me too long to up and disappear
Just give me time, enough time for me to stack a mil'
Then we can hit the hill and build us a tight crib
Some tight cars, candy paint wit' the big wheels
Bulletproof windshields, strapped with the blue steele
I know your love is trill, 'cause you don' stuck wit' me
So if I up and leave this city here, you goin' wit' me
If I come stuntin' in the hood, shit you stuntin' wit' me
And if I'm chiefin' me some wood, shit you chiefin' wit' me
I'll never get through thuggin', but'll be a good husband
The only one you lovin' plus the only one you fuckin'
The situation get ugly, then your head I'm bustin'
That's if you cheat, or you leave a nigga stuck with nothin'
Eventually you'll see, and understand me
So when I'm through off in these streets, one day you'll be

That's why I need a gangsta wife--
Wife-wife(yea-e-yea-ah), wife-wife(o-ooo-oh)
A gangsta wife, down to ride(All I need in my like is a gansta wife...)

A gangsta wife(Any time...), down to ride(...she will lay down her life)

'Cause everythang I did since then, shit I did it for ya
I know you see me a lot of times fussin' with y'all mother
I hear you in the front, hollerin' and cryin' thinkin' I'm hurtin' your mother
That's when I realize, to stop your cries I need to hug ya
That's when I dry your eyes and explain why I'm leavin' your mother
Da-da gon' always be here, not because I made a promise
Shit, I helped created you, even though you came up out her stomach
And everything I got, you can have it ,if you want it
But if I don't have it, and a nigga do, I'mma take it from him
I promise, I'm y'all personal ridah

Now let's just say that if tonight, was the night, that a nigga had to go
Just tell my family that I love'em, 4-1-0 to my Kin Folk
But for my baby daughter, I just feel I ought'ta, let her know
How her daddy was a gangsta, hustled hard to get that doe
A young thug livin', came up off drug dealin', and pistol grippin'
Catch a nigga slippin', and lickin',  most of my competition
Thinkin' with precision, enough to keep me up outta prison
Slangin' with intentions, to get rid of all my chickens
Stayin' strapped with ammunition, that hit niggas from a distance
Once they run they mouth, you'll find them bitches missin' - now pay attention
Now, ain't no need to question why, daddy's a soldier
Full-clip-loader, big-gun-toter, all-day-'dro-blower
I don' sacked the finest green and cracked the finest soda, grindin' to support ya
All the dimes I don' broke up, all the crimes that provoke us
All the grime I don' soaked up, it's my mind that I can't trust
And it gets tuff, thinkin' one day I'll slip up
And leave you all alone, now that's enough to drive me crazy on my own
But baby stay strong... No, I never meant wrong
My only objective, was to provide so you can live long
And everything I speak on, take it to the heart
'Cause if I die tonight, it's on your mom to play her part and my part
And that's hard, that's why I pray to God
And ask him, when He take me out this world
Watch over my baby girl
That's for real

down-south rappers that ain't gettin' no love on
these video stations and on these radio stations...
All my down-south soldiers, they gon' keep doin'
this to us if ya'll don't stand up, right now and ride with us
STAND UP RIGHT NOW, AND NIGGA LET'S RIDE

[Verse 1:  Big Pimp]
I don't know if I'm goin', or leavin', or comin'
But I know Universal got us starvin' and hungry
I'm sick to my stomach, I vomit every time
I see a video on TV that ain't mine
You know I ain't lying, half of 'em can't rhyme
Black Entertainment... why ya'll won't play mine?
We gave two videos to be	-E-T
For both, we paid 200 G's a piece
Ya'll must don't like us, all ya'll must hate us
We don't get no love and support from our label
Two whole years, and ya'll just dropped the album
With no fuckin' commercials or promotions to tell them
That we was comin', so people could go runnin'
To the nearest music store, so we could have us some money
So I could feed all my kids, pay all my bills
Rent thirty days late, so where the FUCK we gon' live?
Nelly and Baby selling records way to Timbuktu
If ya'll put all the money behind them, what the FUCK we gon' use?
But Nelly and Baby, we ain't hatin', we just lettin' it be known
To show the whole world how Universal, doin' us wrong

[Chorus]
Either you gon' love uuus (Either you gon' love uuus)
Or you gonna hate uuus---There's no in-between
I sit and wonder where we went wrong
You motherfuckers better love us or just leave us alone

Either you with uuus (Either you with uuus)
Or you against uuus---There's no in-between
I sit and wonder where we went wrong,
You motherfuckers better love us or just leave us alone

[Verse 2:  Mr. G-stacka]
It's like either you gon' love us, or hate us, bitch niggas, just face us
Two of the coldest thangs ever to touch pencil and paper
How the fuck they gon' replace us, knock'em off it they think such
Been in this game too long, I'll let loose chrome before I get touched
'Cause this shit done got me too hot, and I want to know who shot Tupac
'Cause them might be the same lames that try to make sure we don't reach top
But I think not, 'cause I keep glocks... Ya'll niggas ain't feelin' me
It's time for Pimp and G to get rid of all wack niggas in this industry
It's history, what they should be, all kinda unsolved mysteries
These hollow-T's in this 2-2-3, will end your life so damn tragically
I'm talkin' to all the big men, with authority over our shit playin'
These niggas that's over these video shows is hoes, and that's what G sayin'
Rewind that back and replay it, if didn't quite get through your head
I don't bite my tongue for none, so why in the fuck am I supposed to be scared
Ya'll bitches done brought the south shame, bitin' up all the south game
Then blowin' up off the south name, don't never want to give the south fame
But ya'll better tell'em, that Gangsta straight rebellin'
I'll go off, and put twenty holes in your cerebellum, you smell'em?
They try to stop us, but these niggas fellin'
And every time you see me this is what the fuck I'm yellin'

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:  Mr. G-stacka]
Now off the top I'm tellin' these lame ole, plain ole, sadiddy, and bourgie
want to-be white niggas, 'round here judging gangsta music
See this here is not for you trick, get on up outta office
Let the hood niggas judge me, 'cause the hood is the ones who bought this
In Vibe they tried to talk shit, them sissy there can suck dick
'Cause Pimp and G the rawest, everythang we spit is flawless
Why the hell they want to start us, spittin' false information
They staff get infiltrated, and bullets gon' penetrate 'em

[Big Pimp]
And that's how every rapper, comin' from down south feelin'
We can't speak our minds 'cause east coast run hip-hop television
And it's so puzzling, to the fact and I really don't get it
They still won't play our video even though we put Tigger in it
'Cause we don't dance around on all our videos like P. Diddy
Is ya'll tellin' me that all my videos ain't ""jiggy""?
Oh, you hear me?  And it's a shame, and it's a goddamn pity
How [BET] showin' more love to rappers from New York City


[Chorus]",Love Us or Hate Us
Dirty,"It's raining, it's pouring
My lovelife is boring me to tears, after all these years

No sunshine, no moonlight, no stardust, no sign of romance
We don't stand a chance

I've always dreamed I found the perfect lover
But he turned out to be like every other man

Raining (raining)
Pouring (pouring)
There's nothing left for us here
And we won't waist another tear

If you've had enough, don't put up with his stuff, don't you do it

If you've had your fill, get the check pay the bill, you can do it

Tell him to just get out,

Nothing left to talk about

Pack his raincoat show him out

Just look him in the eye and simply shout:
Enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no
Enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Enough is enough
Enough is enough
That's enough

If you've reached the end, 
Don't pretend that is right when it's over

(it's over)
If the feeling is gone don't think twice just move on, get it over

(over, over)

Tell him to just get out, say it clearly, spell it out:
Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no
Enough is enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Enough is enough
Enough is enough
That's enough

I've always dreamed to find the perfect lover,
But he turns out to be like every other man
Our love (I had no choice from the start)
Our love (I've gotta listen to my heart)
Our love (tearing us apart)

Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no
Enough is enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Enough is enough
Enough is enough
That's enough

No more tears (no more tears)
No more tears (no more tears)
No more tears (no more tears)
No more tears (no more tears)
Enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough
I've had it, you've had it, he's had it, we've had is

I always dreamed I find the perfect lover,

But he turned out to be like every other man

I had no choice from the start
I've gotta listen to my heart
Tearing us apart

Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no
Enough is enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Goodbye mister, goodbye, goodbye mister
Goodbye sugar

It's raining, it's pouring
There's nothing left for us here
And we won't waist another tear

No more tears
Is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough
Is enough!",No More Tears
Dirty,"I'm not gonna scream at this time, nope
But I'mma let 'em know throughout all the hatin'
And all the sticks and stones being throwed at the Pimp and da Gangsta
We stayed on our toes, all ten of 'em
No matter what, representin' Montgomery, Alabama
We still here, all debts paid
'Cause we don' paid our dues, we don' paid 'em

[Chorus]
Ohhh, ooohhh
I don' paid my dues - my dues - my dues (wow, oohhh)
Ooohh, ooohhh
I don' paid my dues - my dues - my dues (wow, oohhh)

Ok, uh
I dedicated ten years of my life, ten years on the mic
Ten years sittin' at home writin' rhymes gettin' tight
And every nigga dream is to blow up over night
But every nigga dream don't seem to turn out right
I had to sacrifice, so school just wan't the thang for me
I rather get a bag of weed and freestyle over every beat I hear
And enter every talent show to let them see our skills
This rappin' shit is school, but it ain't payin' mama bills
And they ask me why I feel, the way I feel for real
'Cause to get to where I am I paid my dues in my career
Like jackin' niggaz beats, hustlin' to get our own
Now we record in studios, we used to spit our raps on the phone
And dealin' with niggaz who claimed they'll manage us
They intentions was good, but their actions almost damaged us
They amateurs, and we was like, way before our time
It was money on our mind, so we stayed on our grind
One day we gon' shine, one day we gon' sign
One day we gon' get paid for writin' these cold ass rhymes
And since that day has came, it's been nothin' but trouble
Some niggaz who rolled with us, is no longer ridin' for us
Some bitches bad-mouthin' our names as if they know us
At first they had our back, now these bitches want to destro' us
But hold up, 'cause we got plenty fans that stayed true
That know what we been through to get here, we paid dues

[Chorus]

Y'all know me  I'm the be-I-G P-I-M-P
Daddy Hall that fat nigga that rap with Mr. G
Ooh Lawd now what would I be without he?
Let me take y'all - back when it started in grade three
Every morning listenin' to this nigga named Boosky
This dude had lyrical flow, killin' niggaz back and forth
Who that there?  Man, how you do that there?
Goddamn I want to do that there
So I went home and wrote my first rhyme, for the first time
Didn't know nothin' 'bout no bar, so I called it my first rap line
In due time, I was rappin' to the beats of Run-D.M.C.(Run-errie-Run)
Learnin' from the super staaars
We they rap I start rappin', when they stopped - I stopped
That's how I learned to count sixteen bars
Every chance I got, I showed my talent
'Cause every month this lady Coon throwed a talent show in Cedar Park
We did it for love, we didn't know nothin' bout know spinnin' rims or candy cars
The tips we got, we bought M&M's and candy bars
Plus at that time, I was still rappin' by myself
I hit eighth grade, then realized that I needed some help
My first time tryin' to find a partner, man I went through a dozen
I went home one day and somethin' said, ""Mayne, listen to your cousin""
His first rap this nigga snapped, first two bars, fightin' and shootin'
And every day black bandana retro J's Nike suits, and
Big gold chains, and bad bitches that like to give brain
Hey, that's my kinda rap, shiet we one in the same
Simple and plain, the rest is history
A quick summary on how I met Mr. G
But since that time, our life don' got better
'Stead of rappin' for dips of chocolate, we rappin' for whips and cheddar
Fo' real, we don' paid our dues me and my lil' cousin, we don' paid our dues

[Chorus]",Paid My Dues
Dirty,"[Chorus]
Pimp life, is the only life I know(only life I know)
Pimp life, keep it gangsta with my hoes(gangsta with my hoes)
Pimp life, don't screw up, don't choose any foes(never choosin' foes)
Pimp life, that's the life I chose(that's the life I chose)

What is it 'bout Gangsta, that got you sprung from him
Catchin' nuts on your tongue from him, pullin' out your guns for him
Then turn right around and spend all your funds on him
Just spoilin' him, and spoilin' him, it's only two days you been knowin' him
I guess this goes to show the wimps, this boy's here born to pimp - forever
I hit the streets stuffed in the Coupe Deville with plushed out leather
With four of my baddest hoes, who knows to bring Da Gangsta chetter
No matter morning, noon, or night or any type of weather
They claim they love me, wouldn't treat no other nigga better
But I don't sweat 'em, I just tell 'em, better yet just let 'em
Do what they do, sooner or later they'll find out I ain't true
But still official, hell they call me Mr. Jizzle
Got two of the baddest strippers lickin' on each other's nipples
It's so simple - they just need motivation, now it's masturbation
And dick suck-you-lick-tacious, I'm facing on every occasion
Don't need persuasion, just kick some conversation
And strip 'em naked, and make them bitches take it
'Cause I'm straight pimpin'

[Chorus]

I leave the club about three-thirty, damn near yawnin'
Been here since twelve, and hell, still ain't found no bitch worth bonin'
""I finna roll"", So I work my way to the front do' I spot Michelle
She used to fuck with this lil' dike bitch named Cocoa
But all I know though, she probably still lick that hoe low
A lot of these hoes tryin' to go pro, if you don't ask, you won't know
You still don't know her do you? 
She used to sell tapes for Jo Pro
You ain't talkin' bout lil' short red Cocoa
Used fuck with your homeboy BoBo
Yep, that's her fo' sho
I was obliged to have both of them hoes off in my ride
But more obliged to see Michelle head 'tween Cocoa thighs
And if you didn't know I was a P-I, M-P
It's in me, genetically, and it better be
From all the pimp game my uncles tellin' me
Upcomin' pimps respectin' me, game ass bitch selectin' me
Can't be the lame trick you expectin' to be
I'm a pimp lil' bitch who you expect to see
With a fifth of Hennessey and some Ecstasy
With two thick freaks sittin' next to me
In a candy pink 'Lac with the matchin' seats
Q-P stash with a dash of be	
Girl, you look to sweet tryin' to dazzle me
Legs cocked up in the passenger seat
I'm a pimp, add it up mathematically
Ha ha, you plus me equal cheese
That's how it was, that's how it is, so I'm assumin' that's how it has to be
I'm a pimp

[Chorus]",Pimp Life
Dirty,"[Intro:  Big Pimp]
Ha ha, off the top
We back, Dirty Boyz
A new beginnin' baby
We doin' this thang with Nfinity, and motherfuckin' Rap-A-Lot
Black Klown forever
All my dirty boyz representing the motherfuckin' south
Alabama that is
Off the top, we still, and we still

[Verse 1:  Big Pimp]
I'm a pimp to the first degree
The same nigga teachin' the pimp game to you
Shit, he heard it from me
Occasionally, I sack and hustle herb on the street
My cousin G say mac these hoes and leave the curb up to me
So I'm oblidged--to tell every girl that I meet
She want to ride--she gotta get some dirt on her knees
It hurt'em to see, they baby mama swervin' with me
Left out your house with some pants but had a skirt underneath
She in the heavy see-H-E-V 350 rockin' with the shift kit hurtin' the street
She on the block like she workin' the street
But if I get her in my car, I'mma have the bitch slurpin' for free
Oh you say you want to twirk for a fee? Well I ain't no trick, BIOTCH
I'll have your ass workin' for me
They call me Peter Wee, because I flirt with the freaks
But you ain't never seen me do it, you just heard it was me
And I'm is...

[Chorus:  Big Pimp] (2x)
We still pimpin' hoes, we still gangstafied
We still ridin' vogues, we gettin' high
We still in the club, we still sackin' wood
We still on them tweety dubs, we still in the hood

[Verse 2:  G-Stacka]
Now you know Gangsta stayin' blacked down, with a black 4-pound
And'll bust off rounds, in your chest until your back blow out
Cause everyday I hit the corner with a cracked up ounce
Them fiends see me, boy they start to do the Crackhead Bounce
And I got grams, grams, and grams of blow
Of pure white snow, I call myself the good-dope-store
You'll catch me deep off in the hood sittin' on all gold spokes
Or probably smokin' on that wood, sippin' that Hypnot-o
And my motto is:  If you ain't gangsta, you ain't livin' right
And if you ain't pimpin' we got prescriptions that'll get you tight
I come from the street, so packin' heat is just a part of life
And game on your wife, freak her one night now she a super dike
And it's the same damn thang everyday, flood the block with ya'
They don't smoke if they don't pay
I got a tech-9 in my waistline that'll leave your smoke gray
And in the hood is where you'll find me on a daily paper chase

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:  G-Stacka]
Now when they see me, hell they holla ""Gangsta what you got for bout two bills""
I'll give your ass a ten pack of triple stack X-pills
And that's real, cause a nigga out here tryin' to live
I hit the block with a bunch of rocks until I stack me a mil'

[Verse 4:  Big Pimp]
I shack/Shaq like O'neal, thirty-two O's in the grill
I point guard with G, but I coach them hoes like I'm Phil
Niggas ask what I'll be doin' if I ain't have this deal
And I tell them ""The same thang for the last eighteen years""
And that is...

Could you read us a hoodtime story please?
[G]Y'all all in the trap
Yep
[G]Ok, ok...Here we go

[Verse 1: Big Pimp]
Once upon a time not long ago, lived two cousins that was broke
With no money in their pocket, they result to sellin' dope
Movin' everythang from regular weed, crack-cocaine, and 'dro
Didn't want the MPD's to catch 'em so they kept it on the low
Bought another and another, broke bread with each other
Sell that butter in the hood and give the rest to their mother
Other brothers wanna flex, then that simp is gettin' fucked up
Call him Gangsta, oh and you may call me Silky Pimp Cutta
Hustle like a mother... gul hand filled with clusters
Alabama on my back, best believe I got the muscle
Crank the 'Lac we gotta roll, they stole the rims up off the Nova
Comin' back from Texas, undercovers tryin' to pull us over
Ridin' up the block doin' eighty-three (eighty-three)
I bet it was some motherfucker hatin' on me (hatin' on me)
Dave the Dope King, supplyin' all the flow
Went to court last week and snitched on all his folk

[Chorus x2: chops and splices with variations throughout the chorus]
Choppin' down the block bitch
Choppin' down the block bitch
Choppin' down the block bitch
Choppin' down the block bitch

[Verse 2: Mr. G-stacka]
Let me take you back to when the Pimp & Gangasta +Hit Da Flo+
You knew the South was finna blow when Pimp & Gangsta hit the do'
Nothin' but the southern slang, you hear it every time we spoke
Now niggaz hollerin' ""Here we is"", throughout the east and west coast
Represent the Gump, let 'em know that Bama got flow
Put it on the map, make 'em adapt to all my country folk
Every city that we go, pack the club and rock the show
Get respect from Gangstas, Vice Lords, Bloods, and the Locs
In the hood they crown us both, kings over all the fakers
Niggaz know they can't fade us, that's way them niggaz hate us
Meanwhile we switched labels, now we with the Mob bitch
J Prince made it able, cause we spit that hard shit
Blackklown a hard clique, as bout as hard a clique can get
Now that we on top, don't no niggaz wanna start shit
The problems that I deal wit' ain't deep enough to have me stoppin'
Hop off in the Chevy, flip-floppin' down the block choppin'

She threw him bread and said make me scream

I'm a goddamn sore loser
I ain't too proud to stay

But I'm still thinking 'bout you
And I'm so lonesome without you
And I can't get you out of my mind

Oh mama don't leave me alone
With my soul sat down so tight it's like a stone cold tomb
Ain't it clear when I'm near you

I'm just dying to hear you
Calling my name one more time
Oh so don't pay no mind

To my watering eyes
Must be something in the air
That I'm breathing

Yes'n I try to ignore
All this blood on the floor
It's just this heart on my sleeve that's a bleeding

Oh mama don't walk away
You leave me here bereaving from the words so hard and plain
Saying the love that we had

Was just selfish and sad
To see you now with him
Is just making me mad

Oh so kiss him again
Just to prove to me that you can
An I will stand here

And burn in my skin
Yes I will stand here
And burn in my skin",Burn

Warn a little to low, you're too slow,

You park so high and mighty, 
But I'm not mighty high dirty smoke you out with weed 
And leave your mouth fucking dry, 
Cause some of them rappin' clappin' laughin'
Always beer tapping fucking dorkette

Like some moon through the pine yo

Then roll with the style the dirty smoking Cali green leaf

And I shine like the chrome of its fender 
Remember this microphone defender return your shit to sender 
Cause no one wants to hear it yo your lyrics are weak 
And yes your spirits meek and you're an ignorant motherfucker 
Yes it shows when you speak your wicked disappointment 
Your rhymes need some ointment the crowd at your shows 
Always laughing and pointin' leave

Once upon a time in the neighborhood, 
There was a little dirty boy that was up to no good, 
He had a chip in his tooth and a mic in his hand, 
He had a dirty ass head from the beach and the sand, 
He said I just got out of the water and i'm late for school 
I asked dirty to skip and he said that's cool
So we went to the liquor store got ourselves 
Some magnum rollin' down the street

Sucker M-C's wanna battle me but that's okay I tell 'em 
Don't fuck around because we don't play I sang rock out with my cock out 
I got balls of steel hear me clanking down the street like a bag of beer, 
Said the dance off session gonna start right here, 
Dirty b grab the wheel cause I cant steer, 
You got 20 inch rims and they spinnin' when you stop, 
Said I don't give a fuck, kill it when the beat drops, 
Cause that's what I respect to all you knuckle heads and derelicts 
Just jammin' down the sound with the syllables and intellect, 
Maybe not the intellect but syllables are clean 
And I leave you in the desert with an empty canteen 
While I'd be rippin' shows from here to the Galapagos 
And id be pickin' foes like id be pickin' the fro, 
And all you chicken head hos that come to pick at my shows you got to go",Antelope

Dirty Heads,"Well this is how it starts, Two lovers in the dark
On the run, from the one That they called Sheriff Spark
Six guns by their side and bullets around their waist
Two shots to the sky
Signal sound for the chase
The safe was nearly empty and They were nearly free
But were seen by the Good eye of the mean Billy Green
And he screamed at the top of his lungs They're on the run
It's the two outsiders Grab your horses and your guns

I said I wish that
We could stay here,
But I fear our time has come
We could ride out in the darkness
Chasing the rising sun
We gotta pack our bags this instant,
We're heading south-bound to the next town
And if we all arrive there so safely,
Baby you can

Lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down

Well it's the story of the two
Always on the move
They got nothing left to lose
'Cept their guns and their wounds
Now they're crossing borders
Sheriffs posse on their tail
They'd rather die together
Than be stuck up in a cell
They drank up all the whiskey and They partied every night
Like it could be the last The bounty said shoot on sight
So they chased the endless summer Though it came with the pride
They wouldn't stop running till They found a paradise
But the sheriff finally found them with his eyes seeing red
So the lovers had to shoot him down and fill him full of lead
They were finally free To find a place to lay their head
And when they finally did he looked at her and then he said

I said I think that we can stay here,
'Cause I feel our time has come
And we can walk down to the ocean,
And sit with the rising sun
So unpack your bags this instant,
No more running from town to town
And now that we've arrived so safely,
Baby you can

Lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down

Well you're my green-eyed girl And I've been running around with you
It's the afternoon and we got nothing left to do
So wipe the dirt off, or Take your shirt off,
And we should go hit the cantina, We got work off
I said it's hot outside Let me go swimming in your eyes
We've been running for a while
Why don't you lay down and make smile
I could never ask for nothing better than this
It's just tequila and the beach, that's why its salty when we kiss

I said I think that we can stay here,
'Cause I feel our time has come
And we can walk down to the ocean,
And sit with the rising sun

Mine was Naughty By Nature back when OPP was hot
Who'd have thought that I could ever turn out this way
I'm blamin' Ad-rock, Mike D and M-C-A

Yeah it was Beasties on mind pretty much all the time
'Til I started smokin' pot and figured out about Sublime
Oh my god I never wanted something so badly

I wanna learn to play guitar and sing just like Bradley
And the b lines that Eric dropped reminded me of hip hop
And I'm singin' lovin' is what I got I got I got
Cause when the lovin' was gone

I learned to play the blues through Stevie Ray Vaughn
I needed music for all the ways it helped me feel
And now I'm lovin' my guitar the way that B.B loved Lucille

Can you feel it? (Yeah)
I'm like, six damn strings never sounded so appealing.
Can you feel it? (Yeah)
I'm like once you grab the mic you better
Sing like you believe
Like you believe, like you believe, like you believe,

Like you believe, like you believe, like you believe,
Well the Marley was the tune Little J was in the womb
My mommy put the headphones on her belly feel me move
And every Jimi Hendrix riff I'd give her a little kick

Just to let her know to turn it up a little bit
And please when I grow up can I sound like Police
That's what I was thinkin' while I prayed on my knees
But now that I'm grown I found a sound of my own
I'm in the studio now and I feel like I'm home

Can you feel it? (Yeah)
I'm like, six damn strings never sounded so appealing.
Can you feel it? (Yeah)
I'm like once you grab the mic you better
Sing like you believe
Like you believe, like you believe, like you believe,
Like you believe.

Now my music's been shelved,
Because these people don't believe in me,
But I'ma feel this ""shuff"" up before they hear the end of me.
I'll be writing songs until the end of all eternity,
I never went to college man, my band was my fraternity.
Never stick my nose in the shit that ain't concern to me,
But I'll be the first to swing, man, if you're burnin' me.
Every day you wait's just another day wasted,
I'm so damn close, man, I can taste it.

Dirty Heads,"Her name was Lily, his was Todd
She was tall and he was odd,
And all the other girls said she was too fat for the squad
She just wanted friends
He just wanted broads
He'll do anything for pussy, change his ways he swore to god
He needs to straighten up
He isn't smart enough
I wouldn't be his date
He doesn't dress like us
Remember all the times that he got beat up on the bus
But what he learned from that was to be careful who you trust
He knew that they were wrong so he took it with a yawn
He knew his time would come and he'd be moving on
So he locked himself inside a room and started writing songs
You could catch him in the back of class singing all along like

Check the level cause something's coming' over me
Check the level cause something's coming' over me
Check the level cause something's coming' over me
Something's got a hold of me always controlling me
It's in the audio, it's in the air, it's in the way you move
It's everywhere, it's something beautiful, that you don't know
So feel the audio, and let it go

Well back to miss lily when she used to let the days pass
Sitting home alone sucking food up off her placement
They used to call her fat so she started losing weight fast
Got sick in debate class, to throw up what she ate last
She didn't know that the things they said that left her hurting
Would actually turn out to make her a better person
She locked herself inside her room got to the rehearsing
Walking down a runway in a dress she made from curtains
So she started slimming up
She was tall enough
She became a model she was paid and she was loved
See what they thought they knew about these two was givin' up
Cause no matter what they said these two just didn't give a fuck
They had it all along they just figured it out
How to take the negativity and turn it all around
Now lily's turning heads up on the runway in Milan
And Todd is selling millions while his fans sing along like

Check the level cause something's coming' over me
Check the level cause something's coming' over me

It's the six string slayer the rhyme cultivator
Picking' home grown rhyme straight out the incubator
Cross fade to the right while I slide to the left
There's something coming over me controlling every breath
Gasping for air my fears burn through
If there's something in the audio then what they said was true
Full speed ahead code red phase two
The sound waves control the minds of me and you

And realizing now just in life what I'm missin',
There so much more then just regrets
'Cause if you can't love yourself how can you love next.

We had this dream to rock yo it be so cool.
And I remember just chillin' out in my back yard
Sipping on some 40's writing songs laughing so hard.

It always seemed like such a dream to me it always
Seemed like it was so far from reality but deep inside
I always knew that it would be my path and if I ever got a chance yo
I would make it last but I've been

Driftin' so long, from myself and from the pain.
Driftin' so long, I think I found better way.

I feel like I've been changing, and I don't like just what I see
I feel like I'm the victim and my own worst enemy.

Well I've been driftin' missin' the times we didn't listen to no one
But ourselves because we knew we were on a mission
No one ever thought it'd happen for two of the boys to get paid for rapping

I got people looking after me the way I go the path I lead
Some say it's not a job but we practice like an athlete
I'm constantly drifting but I finally found what I need
Its passing me in forms of speech every time I pass the beach

Driftin' so long, from myself and from the pain.
Driftin' so long, I think I found better way.
(I found a better way and now I strive for better days)

Well I lost my path but I found my way,
We can all learn from our own mistakes,
Sometimes I'm wrong but l learn that way,
But we won't ever know until we stop

Sick to your stomach when ya find an ill MC
With the symphony the illest infantry drops ya down for the century 
The illest penalty said I know I'm hard to see I kill myself but leave my entity 
But jump up off a track like a cricket make it Jiminey
Original cynical head bob, four star general
I find my with my tentacle, my rhyme style's identical to none
Ya bite me end up like ya grandfather straight chewin' with ya gums
Its the D-J selector comin' hard on the record with the effort full effect
DJ science break your neck when tounges twist syllables trip lips that make hits
Never leave unfulfilled like a hooker with one tit, a group with one hit,

It's like my eyelids are glued to the top of my forehead. 
I lie in bed with my eyes wide open 
But Duddy don't you worry you'll be sleeping in a moment, 
Then moments turn minutes and minutes turn to hours 
Then hours turn to long ass nights and cold showers. 

It's four in the morning still wide awake 
Let's see how many bong tokes Duddy B can take. 
I already drank all the alcohol left in my house so now 
I sit here wide awake with a dry fucking mouth 
And I just think of all the things on my mind 
And then I let um roll around about a million times 
Until it's got me you it grabs a hold of me baby, 
It's insomnia kids you know its drivin' me crazy.

Turn out the lights, lie my head down, 
I lie my head down, I close my eyes.
Now all I do girl is lie here 
I think I'll die here 
Insomnia.

Push my face in the pillow to asphyxiate the sound, 
I'd cry my self to sleep but I'm too scared that I might drown. 
I'm calling for the sandman but I don't think he's in town, 
And all these sleepless nights have running thoughts have got me down. 
I wish I had a sudden case of narcolepsy 
Maybe call up Duddy B so we can smoke the best weed 
And give me something nice so it can calm my chest peace 
And talk about these things that we really don't need. 
Now as I lay in bed in my head I'm running circles 
Stuck in the land of low light and infomercials. 
It's insomnia kids you know its drivin' me crazy 
Only thing that can save me is an overdose maybe. 

Turn out the lights, lie my head down, 
I lie my head down, I close my eyes.
Now all I do girl is lie here

Seas would rise when I gave the word

Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing:
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in.
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king? 

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield

For some reason I can't explain

She likes her beer real cold and her whiskey straight
Stayin' up all night and then we sleep all day
But if the sun comes steppin' in early
And I'm waitin' for my wallet to be empty
'Cause last night was next level, I was off my leash
I can still look at her with no anxiety because

She don't get mad when I'm out of control
When I'm blacked out drunk, at the top of my lungs
Man she just laughs and rolls
Well she's my lady, baby I know this is always true
I see you yellin' at your girlfriend,
Mine's the shit, well how 'bout you?

Dirty Heads,"Well come with me to a place by the sea,
If your ship breaks down, you can always find me,
And Dirty J chillin' underneath the shady tree,
Our fans are always welcome with our friends and family.

And if you wish you can stay, as long as you please
Just lend a helping hand up at our cabin by the sea
Where everyday is beautiful, the sun, the sand, the breeze
And everybody lives together here in harmony

And we'll sing
Just as loud as we please,
And we will be,
Forever so free,
So come follow me, cabin by the sea.

Picture you and me in the cabin by the sea.
You paint the fence, I'll hang the tire from the tree.
Our friends are all around, and the storm was a no show
Said we look better in the black and white photo.

Picture you and me in the cabin by the sea.
Sit up on a porch and we can burn a couple trees.
Our friends are all around and the storm was a no show,
Said we looked better in the black and white photo.

What the photograph don't show, is where we're headed tomorrow
And when we have to go, we'll always be together in the black and white photo.

Gather up some rocks and make a circle in the sand.
We'll fill it up with wood and build a fire with our hands,
The smoke starts to rise, the moon starts to shine,
You bring the weed, we'll bring the whiskey and the wine

And we can pass it all around, until it's all gone,
Put a message in the bottle, put the cork back on.
We'll throw it in the sea, the message it will read,
If you find this don't send help, send another bottle please!

And we'll sing but just as loud as we please.
But and we will be, forever so free,
So come follow me, cabin by the sea.

Picture you and me in the cabin by the sea.
You paint the fence, I'll hang the tire from the tree.

We can start a fire to sit around.

We can start a fire to drink around.

You better dance all night

Apocalypse now, we own the night
Got two choices surf or fly
Skate or die, sink or swim
Crash or fly, look within
I do not let this bullshit phase me I see lights and I go crazy
Cool is the wind, dark is the sky
Blackbird sings in the dead of the night
Take these broken joints and get high
Take your worries kiss 'em goodbye
Tonight has been so amazing
I see you and I go crazy
You put me into this trance
I hear music lets dance

We ain't gonna stop now, dancing on top
We ain't gonna stop now, no

Like an eagle flying across the sky, and they wonder why
When they ponder on the creation of his majesty
I believe in we, I believe in you and me
As we swim upon the ocean, swim on the sea
Won't you please come with me, running up into the hills
And the trees we can fall down through the tumbleweeds

I will be our king, you will be my kingdom
I will promise to sing them

The one chance to give so I'ma give it

Standing in my own two shoes my whole life is
Easier said than done but I survive it
Aim for the stars, dream big and don’t hide it

I’m so high I’m never coming down
I like living up here, watching life from the sky

I’ve seen the fire and I’ve seen the rain
I’ve been places and ask questions
But was told that my answers were blowing in the wind

So now I follow the purple haze
All the way through the everglades
I’ve broken through to the other side
Just to find myself building castles in the sky

Never rise up, I can see reality below me
Floating on a dream to the house of the holy
Hands clinch tight praying death come slowly
'Cause life's too short to give up what you're holding

Dirty Heads,"Well I'm so laid back, I'm my own worst enemy, keep it all inside bottled up bad energy,
Then I hear the sound of this musical amphetamine, 
Diggin' at my soul like the tracks full of ketamine 
Never slowing down fast forward's all I've ever seen, pockets never dry 
Man you can call me evergreen, two bottles of wine, three teas, and some Vicodin 
Every single night same thing until I'm one eying, 
Always keep my shit locked tight no oxygen
If you don't believe me, go kick rocks with some moccasins
Couldn't find a hipster to fix gears on my rockin' man
Everywhere I go I got the whole room talkin' man.

I know I've got all that I need so I'll give to you
All of the love you give to me and we'll carry through
So endlessly, we will carry on through your energy
Every song we sing creates a memory
I wouldn't change for anything, music is eternity and lives in me eternally
Endlessly, we will come together like a symphony
And everything you do feels like it's meant to be 
It's endlessly, music is eternity and lives in me eternally.

Said you wanna play this game with me but you got way too much lag 
Wish you had my gamer tag, wish I could be cut in half, half to write your songs for you
The other half to spit your raps, put this on my epitaph I don't give a rat's ass
I don't even rhyme I just whine really fast, and I ain't got the time, 
I'm just sand in the glass,
This time you shall not pass 'cause I'm the dragon smog, 
I'm a small axe move big trees you still play with Lincoln logs
Why don't you go take a jog better yet go kick some rocks
Let me guess you got a blog, follow trends like it's your job
I prefer to be myself you wanna be like everybody else
Like a ticket, need some help gonna get scalped Indian pelt.

I know I've got all that I need so I'll give to you
All of the love you give to me and we'll carry through
So endlessly, we will carry on through your energy
And every song we sing creates a memory
I wouldn't change for anything, music is eternity and lives in me eternally

This is how it's supposed to be, carried by this melody
Exactly where I'm supposed to be, my feet walk steady to my own heart beat
And I will carry on through the sounds of my soul, 
The love that we give will be repaid in full
All that we are is under our control

So endlessly, we will carry on through your energy
Every song we sing creates a memory

Whoa, you got the peace from the summer wind
I can hear it now when I heard it then
We got this song on our repeat then, whoa
Don't wanna know when my heart will end

Your love gets me so high
Like when we're listening to Bob Marley
And you can feel it in the melody
Your love gets me so high
Like when we're listening to Bob Marley
And you can feel it in the melody

He's got us singing like whoa, oh, whoa
You know we got the feeling right
Whoa, oh, whoa, yeah

You said it's close to perfection
I heard it in your inflection
He's your favorite selection
Of my records collection
So let it spin so don't stop or let it go
Just wanna know if you'll stay with me
Now that thing's I make them stop

Your love gets me so
Your love gets me so
Your love gets me so stoned
Like Bob Marley
And you can feel it in the melody

You got me singing like whoa, oh, whoa
You know we got the feeling right
Whoa, oh, whoa, yeah

Whoa, oh, whoa
You know it's got us feeling right
Whoa, oh, whoa, yeah",Your Love
Dirty Heads,"Come with me to a place by the sea
If your ship breaks down you can always find me
Dirty J chillin' underneath the shady tree
My fans are always welcome with my friends and family
And if you wish, you can stay as long as you please
Just lend a helpin' hand up in our cabin by the sea
Well everyday is beautiful, the sun yes and the breeze
And everybody lives together here in harmony
And we will sing just as loud as we please
And we will be forever so free
So come follow me
To the cabin by the sea

Picture you and me
By a cabin in the sea
You paint the fence, I'll hang a tire from the tree
Our friends are all around
And the storm is a no-show
You said we look better in a black and white photo

Picture you and me in a cabin by the sea
Sit up on our porch and we can burn a couple trees
Our friends are all around
And the storm was a no-show
You said we look better in a black and white photo

But what the photograph don't show
Is where we're headed tomorrow
And when we have to go,
We'll always be together
In the black and white photo

Gather up some rocks and make a circle in the sand
We'll fill it up with wood and make a fire with our
hands
The smoke starts to rise, the moon starts to shine
You bring the weed, we'll bring the whiskey in a bottle
Pass it all around until it's all gone then
We'll put a message in the bottle
Put the cork back on
We'll throw it in the sea
The message, it will be:
If you find this send an ounce and another bottle,
please
And we'll sing
Just as loud as we please
And we will be forever so free
So come follow me

Ooh-oh, say we look better in the black and white photo

And when the sun goes down
We can start a fire to sit around
When the sun goes down
We can start a fire, start a fire

When the sun goes down
We can start a fire to drink around
When the sun goes down
We can start a fire, start a fire

When the sun goes down
We can start a fire to sing around
When the sun goes down
We can start a fire, start a fire",Cabin By the Sea [Live]

She left me here
With sand in my bed
She played me all night long
But I'd do it all over again, Oh

My Sweet Summer is gone
And on my mirror, she made it clear
Her Lipstick can't be wrong
My summer, summer, my sweet summer is gone

My Sweet Summer is gone

Warm was the weather outside the day we met
Blue was the color of skies the day she left
Short was the time we had, it was the best
'Cause long were the nights we spent with no rest
I met her on a Friday, she left on a Monday
Wrote me a letter said she hoped to see me someday
We had a good time, I can't deny that
You can be my sunshine every time you fly back

Cause there's another one you're loving, and
I hate to see you go

My Sweet Summer is gone

With sand in my bed
She played me all night long
But I'd do it all over again, Ooh

Yeah she left in the morning, gone without warning
Fun while it lasted, lost in the moment
She played me real good, took me for a ride
Now she's off on an airplane, back to real life
Yeah she dipped out
Smoked all my weed then she flipped out
Left in my slumber, waited 'til I passed out
And on my dresser was a paper and her number
I filled up with grass and I burned it, for summer

Cause there's another one you're loving, and
I hate to see you go

On the outside of the fence

Where you going, I wanna know
Plunge the spade deep in the soil
So you'll be near me

Insert the name it once told

Forever

As I grind up these remnants
Breathe it in blow it out to the emptiness
I act on love but sometimes my love is the deadliest
I feel the mood change when the high hits and these lights dim
These people are strange
I'm a stranger storm riding
She loves the shade
Below these leaves her body lays
Beneath this tree I placed a grave
Replaced her moon with roots and rain
And now she's mine

And when flowers grow from bloody soil
It makes them ultraviolet, my love

Gave me a touch
Said what's up
I said fucking, nothing much

Very super sick and ready to roll
Got the grinder out and shredded the dough
Now it's time to get kinetic, we headed
For vertical travel you like never before

What I'm thinking, I'm thinking a Ménage
Loving the feeling, I got to end a massage
I gotta sit I'm thinking I'm having dinner with God
Super silver haze, taking me up
Super killer babes, shaking they butts
All the beauty steady making me puff
And the central making me lust
That's what I yearn for
Something so beautiful when we cipher, I'm not thinking about no germ so
My turn you all
What about some love and I'm concerned though
We learn though
Really make you make my worm grow

I can feel it coming down harder than before

Written on bamboo
Get another tattoo
As I light up a Camel
Just might have a fight at night
While I write by the light of the candle
When the vibe gets low and the mind will show
And the voice begin to ramble
Leave me for dead and take my head
Raise a cup put up on the mantel
Lifes color’s vibrant
Wonder where the time went
I am living priceless while your life is on consignment
Sniper with alliance
Rifle breaks the silence
I’m shooting off my mouth to show
The essence of defiance
Time to shred rage is on
If the feeling ain't right then I’d rather be wrong
And if this night’s just right hangovers long
Molotov night

Smile on my face in the middle of a riot
Looking from the top
Even if you wanna try it
You meet me at the highest
Leave with the lighter
It’s dark in the shadows when you’re hanging out with giants

Cast away to an island
Nothing’s harder than hiding
Being all by myself
You’re resorting to violence
You turned into a tyrant
Telling me stop being silent

Push me too far I unload my battle ship

No one can break my silence
They so violently keep trying
I’m just holding on to what’s real
I’m searching out for what’s true
You can take all that you want

Forget your mind and shut your eyes so that you can see
And leave the gray old world behind you

With our sweet hearts we tried to make a brand new start
May the fabric never tear us apart

And some day when we're in the cold
Here's a semblance we can hope
So pick a posy and put it on your heart for me

It wouldn't hurt just to give it a try and win

But I bet you can't do ?em half as good as me
Throw it out when it's over, it's over

So sow it up, kid, have some clout
We?ll go to mine and sulk about
How the sun will shine tomorrow

Of the nuts I bust (I bust)
I'm swerving, looking through my rearview nervous
While your head steady working
And your neck steady jerking
Up on your knees in my seat
And your lips steady slurping
I don't just kill a knob
And I know your mouth finna' throb
And baby if you could
Shine and rob with your tongue
Like old Inga Shywood (Shywood), situation all good
I love the way you got straight to it 
And plus I love the way you do it
I wouldn't take nothing from you
Girl you's a true headhunter
Booger-lips turner
You must have got it from you mother
Now look up in the sky, it's a pimp in the air
So freaky bitches better beware
I got your mind, mega blown
With the game that I spit
And keep them freaky bitches horny as hell",Ride

[Verse 1]
That hoe don't like me and I know it cause I fucked her baby daddy
The dumb bitch that's why she can't stand me
On the weekend I was creeping
With yo man Hilton Inn bitch in 210
That hoe don't understand that I can fuck her man
I want to take him home bitch cause I can
I'm looking good when I fall off in this club
These hoes hate cause they know what ???
I got a man but I really want yours
That nigga had you thinking he was with his boys
You just the baby mama and I don't see the drama
So why this hoe thinking she's the holy one Shana
You never was, you never will
That's how I feel bitch I'm justing being real
Them hoes mad cause I'm riding in that Caddy
Well stay the fuck out of mine and you can have it

Friday night
A chick flick in the VCR
I watched you
Roll your eyes
And knew I'd have to twist your arm when you said
""You expect a guy like me to sit and watch this mushy stuff!
They always fall in love when they first meet
That never happens to folks like us.""

Tried not to laugh out loud cause I remember when

It happened to me just a few months back
In the middle of the week and just like that

You're not like me
You don't believe in fairy tales

I used to feel the way you feel

Dirty Three,"Last boat, stand in a river;
Muddy river, how I love her
Hawk flying is fooling his folly
Gas hurricanes spray over Heaven
Weeping willow is bawling the light
On fire.
Humans running for cover,
Wishing for life, gripping the light
House lift up, trees lift up
Cars intersect in the middle of the sky.
O time before, no pull, no gravity on the ground
Givin' up--it's over
The world's weight is over
The limit
Our bodies are exploding
As the sky spills through our mouths.
All the blue blood is flowing
The cities, its contents have been ripped out.
The world is gone.
Did you know it would last this long?
You made it to the dark, now you're gone.
You are gone.

Frozen in a secret space
A great big place,
Dark-spilling universe.

Shadows start to fall
Temptation is calling
Coming for us all

Flames are getting higher
People come and go
Just for a second
I was in a world of my own

It's a habit of mine
Sometimes it makes me wonder
Is it passion or crime
It's like a wave that pulls me under

7 o'clock in the morning
Somewhere I shouldn't be
My heart beats out a warning
Don't bite the hand that feeds

It's a habit of mine
Sometimes it makes me wonder
Is it passion or crime

There's a place for me
And life is full of questions

Through these veins I feel
A certain kind of thrill
And I'm flying in all directions

Drown in all the glory
That surrounds you
Surrounds you!

Won't you shelter me
Keep me company
As I'm searching for protection
To keep me alive

With these hands I feel
A certain kind of thrill
And I have in my possesion
What keeps me alive

It turns my head around
And that keeps me alive

K hat's geschafft vor 'n paar Monaten mit Kiffen aufzuhören
Und gewinnt g'rade Distanz zu den Dingen, die ihn zerstören
Hing 'n paar Jahre in der Luft
Wenn er sagte: ""Jetzt is' Schluss."", ging's gerade erst bergab
Resultat daraus war Frust
Ja, er hat alles wirklich wichtige vernachlässigt
Oft schien theoretisch alles gut, aber nie tatsächlich
War der derbste Ochse, ist zusammengefallen
Wirkte im allgemeien wie 'n Schatten seiner Vergangenheit
In mancher Zeit fiel ihm die Decke auf den Kopf
Wir trafen uns auf ein, zwei Zigaretten um den Block
Er erzählte immer von Pech und einem Loch, in dem der Ausgang fehlt
Und dass die Trauer quält
Ich rede immer von Entscheidungen
Heut' hat er 'n Stress im Griff und geht zum Sport
Wenn ich ihn seh', nehm' ich ihn fresher mit, als je zuvor
Er sagt, in Zeiten, wo man die Tage zählt
Nicht steh'n und in Bewegung bleiben, darum geht's

Zeiten kommen, Zeiten gehen, bleib' nich' stehen
Wenn sie dich mit auf Reisen nehmen
Es geht um Bewegung, keiner kann am Zeiger drehen

V ist, seit ich ihn kenn', einer der Ziele formuliert
Mit 'ner Ausstrahlung, dass ihn nix und niemand irritiert
Ja, der Junge hatte immer genug Träume für zehn
Neue Ideen, wild entschlossen Erfolge zu seh'n
Die Hälfte von allem, was ich weiß, weiß ich von ihm
Ging's um Weiterkommen im Kopf war'n wir beide ein Team
Einer meiner besten Freunde, das wird immer so sein
Weil wir mehr als unsere Meinung und Erinnerung teilen
Vor ein paar Jahren zog er eine Weile weg zum Studieren
Es wurd' klar, dass man langsam die Connection verliert
Er ist Idealist mit 'nem Drang zu mehr
Heißt, egal was du machst, mach's mit ganzem Herz
Zu viele geben Versprechen, du bist einer, der sie hält
Wegen der Entscheidung, die du fällst
Ich weiß seit lang nich', wo du bist, was du machst, wie du gerade lebst
Und denk' immer an Bewegung bleiben, darum geht's

Bei mei'm Bruder is' gerade jetzt das Zweite auf'm Weg
Und ich kann es kaum erwarten, die Kleine zu seh'n
Als wir uns kenn'gelernt haben, war'n wir beide noch blind
Für das Wesentliche, alles hatte keinerlei Sinn
Es fehlte 'n Ziel, damals war das Leben 'n Spiel
Mit den Jahren kommen Erfahrungen, die geben Profil
Wenn ich heute so bedenke, wie wir ehemals war'n
Bin ich einfach nur zufrieden, welche Wege wir nah'm
Leben kann man nich' berechnen, es geht sein' Gang
Geh' nich gegen an, lass es gehen, geh' und steh' dein Mann
Ich bin mit dir, neben dir, hinter dir und schieb' an
Wenn du die Segel hisst und den Wind nich' spürst
Rücken an Rücken bis zum letzten Tag

Schon zu Zeiten der Maya war es normal, dass der eine 'n Pool hat
Während der andere auf der Straße wohnt
Das ist die Natur des Menschen Geiz zu fühl'n und nicht zu teil'n
Schon die Māori wussten, jeder kämpft für sich allein
Schon die Tuareg zeigten, dass die Menschen halt nicht fähig sind sozial zusammenzuleb'n

Gut, da war mal irgendwas in Frankfreich vor 200 Jahr'n

Während man ihn reitet und die Angst nach Futter - rasend schnell

Man zeigt dir den ganzen Kuchen und die Krümel sind für dich
Mit den Jahren kriegst du 'n Knacks in deiner Psyche und zerbrichst

I hope that you can hear me,
I hope that you can feel me.

Well I've been here all night
And I'm watching you

Is it really you or just a machiene
That's giving you life and
Making it seem that there could be hope
I could say it to your face?
If it weren't for you then
There would be no grace
That's covered my life.

And found my joy for life again
