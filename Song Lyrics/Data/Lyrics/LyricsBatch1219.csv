The Escorts,"And I wake up in the mornin' 
With my hair down in my eyes and she says ""Hi"" 
And I stumble to the breakfast table 
While the kids are goin' off to school goodbye 
And she reaches out 'n' takes my hand 
And squeezes it 'n' says ""How ya feelin', hon?"" 
And I look across at smilin' lips 
That warm my heart and see my mornin' sun 
 
And if that's not lovin' me 
Then all I've got to say 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime 
And there's no such thing as Doctor Seuss 
Or Disneyland, and Mother Goose, no nursery rhyme 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime 
And when my self is feelin' low 
I think about her face aglow and ease my mind 
 
Sometimes I call her up at home knowin' she's busy 
And ask her if she could get away and meet me 
And maybe we could grab a bite to eat 
And she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me 
And I'm always late 
But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me 
'cause she's made that way 
 
And if that ain't lovin' me 
Then all I've got to say 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't snow in Minneapolis when the winter comes 
And there's no such thing as make-believe 
Puppy dogs, autumn leaves 'n' BB guns 
 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't rain in Indianapolis",Little Green Apples
The Escorts,"Ooh la, la, la, la.
I did you wrong, my heart went out to play 
And in the game I lost you, what a price to pay!
I'm cryin', ooh baby baby ooh baby baby
 
Mistakes I know I've made a few, 
But I'm only human;  you've made mistakes too!
I'm cryin', ooh baby baby ooh baby baby
 
Ooh baby baby
Ooh baby baby I'm just about at the end of my rope.
But I can't stop tryin', I can't give up hope 
'cause I feel someday I'll hold you near, 
Whisper I still love you 
Until that day is here ooh I'm cryin'.

The Essence,"Dream away near the fire
Near the fire in our eyes
Save your soul from the fire
Or you'll burn
Drown away in the fire
Like ice
Move away from the fire
Or you'll burn

Into the heat we shout like hell
All the angels follow
Wasted time we fall apart

Safe again and the ice melts
In our hands
You move again like the fastest
Slowest words
Like heaven's gone and I'm waiting for the light
As we walk into the fire
It just shines

Into the dream we shout at you
All the angels follow
Dream away just through the night

Everybody just felt cold
Just dream away all through the night
We move through the woods
Hear a scream oh it's ice cold
It seemed so low we wasted all those times
Times

Into a dream we shallow
And all the angels follow
Into the night I die so cold",Burned in Heaven

I always believed
Always the same somehow
Do you want to break up
And believe I'm gone
But don't you believe
Just everything I say
I'll never know why
I always ran away
Do you want to believe
I would only leave
 
But watch this tonight
Another film gone
I'll never know why
I always sing this song
Do you want to believe
I could only sing
 
And I'll dance
And I'll scream
And I'll tear
The walls down
Once more
If I could only
Forget your heart
Forget your name
I'll never know why
I always say the same",Thirtysecondsong

The Essence,"You don't bring me flowers
Cause the flowers are dead for you
You watch me standing alone
On a bridge
I thought you told me the truth
In a room for years we stayed
We stared each others' eyes

This way

Like a sad goodbye
 
For always and always I'd stayed
And always and always you run away
 
I don't bring you flowers
Because I know it's no use
I know that I must go on
With or without you
I watched you for hours and hours
This picture in my hand
I could scream like you used to
Scream only
And cry all the time
 
For always and always I'll remember you
For always and always you'll remember me

The Essence,"On a cold september night
We met
And felt our love
First time
We held each other close
And all she said ""just hold me tight""
I held her in my arms once more
And wandered in the park with the dog
We laughed and cried
And talked how good it felt
And kissed for ever more
And how we only used to feel
And all the plans we made
And all that mattered was our love
Sealed with a ring
Engraved
As the yeards went slowly by

And all these things
Just changed somehow
I wander in the park alone
No smell of you
No fur at all
I hold you in my arms once more
A picture of a year before
I laugh and cry
And think how good it felt
When we kissed evermore
And now I only think of you
And all the love we had
And all that's left
Of me and you
It's just the ring

Days when the rains came ?
Down in the hollow

Hide behind a rainbow's wall

Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium

The Et's,"Je me demande pourquoi les bonhommes de neige ne pleurent qu'au printemps x2

En hiver il y a du vent et du froid un sale temps et le soir 
Tous les gens sont en noir
Le visage triste c'est la crise et la brise joue l'artiste 
Et la neige comme des larmes dans le ciel nous attriste
Un personnage dans le noir y assiste 
Un bonhomme de neige qui pourtant n'est pas triste
Devant lui défile des silhouettes sombres des ombres qui en nombre
Dans leur manteau s'enfoncent
Malgré tout il a un sourire sur ses lèvres il célèbre l'hiver entouré par de jeunes élèves
C'est pour ça qu'il ne pleure pas c'est pour ça qu'il ne pleure pas


Refrain

Je me demande pourquoi les bonhommes de neige ne pleurent qu'au printemps x 4


Au printemps tout le monde souffle les fenêtres s'ouvrent 
Et quand tout le monde dit ouf sous le soleil notre ami souffre
Plus les couleurs se déposent plus notre ami se décompose
Et plus les degrés montent et plus c'est dur de garder la pose
Ce qu'il ressent c'est que plus personne ne lui ressemble 
Il plaide l'innocence pendant que le soleil le descend
Son moral et tombé de ses échasses 
Il a perdu de son charme on a même pillé son écharpe
L'homme de neige n'a plus son sourire sur ses lèvres ça s'achève 
Plus de rêve délaissé par les jeunes élèves 
Il ne pleure qu'au printemps il ne pleure qu'au printemps

C'est marée haute je ne sais plus à quoi m’amarrer

C'est un festin sein et de fesses hein
des timp des pétrins je ne mange pas de ce pain
mais bon je suis un blédard alors parfois je déteins
Les parisiens se prennent tous pour les plus beaux
les plus haut on ne voit pas les autres depuis le hublot
les parisiennes se prennent pour les plus belles
et plus elles grandissent leur copains deviennent au pluriel
Dans ma ville on vit au rythme du métro
des mégos et des gos et trop souvent de l'égo
de texto pour aboutir sur du sexo
ma ville a pas mal de blem-pro
mais bon je l'aime trop

The Et's,"Je réalise que la vie n'est qu'une salle d'attente
Pleine d'épreuve qui te pousse à presser la détente
Je ne suis pas triste même quand mes yeux versent une pluie battante
Parce que je sais que de l'autre côté beaucoup de personne m'attendent 
Je réalise que l'amour n'est qu'une salle d'attente 
Des projets des disputes des moments de détente
Et on attend on attend que la haine se répande
Et plus on tire sur le fil et plus il se détend 
Je réalise que le succès n'est qu'une salle d'attente
Plus on avance plus on avance plus il y a de chose à apprendre 
Et plus on donne plus on donne plus les autres en attendent 
Plus tu monte sur du monde plus tu as besoin de défense 
Et j'ai peur que la mort ne soit qu'une salle d'attente
Pas de paradis pas d'enfer pas de vision marquante
Juste une salle comme une autre où tout le monde s'impatiente

Je vois des filles des coeurs qui vacillent des soleils qui chavirent des esprits qui naviguent (dans mes souvenirs d'été) x 2 
Dans mes souvenirs d'été


Couplet 


A la sortie d'un bar au milieu de nul part
Après un tour en caisse je finis par éteindre mes phares 
Elle s'appelait Laeticia ou quelque chose comme ça 
C'est ce que ses lèvres m’ont dit avec un gout de Tequila
Au détour d'une ruelle je suis tombé sur elle 
Après quelque mots au râteau elle préfère la pelle
Et devant son hôtel elle m'a laissé son tel
Et aujourd'hui encore elle attend que je la rappelle 

Couplet 


Quelque part sur la côte j'en ai trouvé une autre 
Et grâce a quelque potes on s'est retrouvés côte à côte 
Je ne me rappelle ni de son nom ni de sa jupe ni de ses bottes 
Et si je n'ai plus de nouvelles aujourd'hui je pense que c'est de ma faute 
A l'intérieur d'une boite quelque échanges de droite
Après une soirée arrosée on se retrouve en boite 
Elle s'appelait… hue … ça finissait par A 
C'est son accent qui me l'a dit en me lisant mes droits 


Refrain",Souvenirs D’Été

J' ai perdu mes repères
Je viens d' une autre planète
Isolé dans l' univers 
cette réalité m' étouffe

A la recherche du Bonheur 
Bientôt à Cour de Carburant 
Dans un vaisseau à la dérive 
Alors je lance un SOS

Depuis môme il n'y a pas de mot correctement me nomme
J'ai les deux pieds sur le sol mais les pensées qui s'envole
j'ai le passé qui me colle mais mes actes qui s'en veulent
qui s’engueulent et je me sens seul et je noircit la feuille
je le sentiment que c'est ma maison qui m'acceuille
Et j'appelle et j'appelle des souvenirs a la pelle
et j'ai de la peine oui de la peine car trop manque a l'appel
Je veux prendre une direction mais je ne sais pas laquelle
Je veux allé vers le succès mais j'ai peur de tomber de ma selle

The Ethiopians,"When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me

The Ethiopians,"You've never seen my face before
You will not recognize my voice
I am the perfect law to end these wicked crimes
I am a man without a past

I face a world without a future
And I've done it all at least a million times
I'm the eyes that read between the lines
I devise the rumor and vicious lies

I do everything I can to hide the truth
But can you see it in my eyes?
I kill spies

As I walked into the room
I couldn't help but feel the tension
I can hear your thoughts, I can read your mind
I've been through this all before

By persistence, by intention
I just do my job and leave the past behind
Once there was a time when I believed
Anything could happen at any time

I've been waiting for this moment all my life
And now at last the pleasure's mine
I kill spies

Always so easy to play
I'd rather keep my head down
Carry out the rest of my day
Somethin' 'bout the way that
People love their harm
I've got an eye for trouble
And that's what keeps me up in arms
You've got this thing about you
That keeps me on the edge of my seat
'Cause every time you smile
I can tell you're just showing your teeth

It bothers me to notice
But it sure seems you like that game
Surprises me every time
But really it's just the same
You handle everything and everyone
With that velvet glove
But when you take it off
I can see your skin is not enough
There's something there about you
Like an animal ready to feed
And every time you smile
I can tell you're just showing your teeth

Speak a little softer now
Or maybe just use your eyes
Pull her in around you
Using love as your disguise
There's danger in everything
You say and do
I guess we're not so different
And that's what makes me blue
The funny thing about it is
I know you got what I need
When every time you smile
I can tell you're just showing your teeth

leave the winter on the ground.

in the bedroom and all around.

Touch me now, I close my eyes and dream away.

It must have been love but it's over now.
It must have been good but I lost it somehow.
It must have been love but it's over now.
From the moment we touched 'til the time had run out.

Make-believing we're together,
that I'm sheltered by your heart.
But in and outside I've turned to water
like a teardrop in your palm.
And it's a hard winter's day, I dream away.

It must have been love but it's over now,
it was all that I wanted, now I'm living without.
It must have been love but it's over now,

The Eurobeats,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

For the one that makes me weep

Give relief and wash away 
The memory of the night before

So it stood ninety years on the floor
It was taller by half
Than the old man himself
Though it weighed not a pennyweight more
It was bought on the morn
Of the day that he was born
And was always his treasure and pride
But it stopped short
Never to go again

Ninety years without slumbering

Swing to and fro
Many hours had he spent while a boy
And in childhood and manhood
The clock seemed to know
And to share both his grief and his joy
For it struck twenty-four
When he entered at the door
With a blooming and beautiful bride

Not a servant so faithful he found
For it wasted no time
And had but one desire
At the close of each week to be wound.
And it kept in its place
Not a frown upon its face
And its hand never hung by its side
But it stopped short

In the dead of the night
An alarm that for years had been dumb
And we knew that his spirit
Was pluming his flight
That his hour of departure had come
Still the clock kept the time
With a soft and muffled chime
As we silently stood by his side
But it stopped short
Never to go again

The Everly Brothers,"O little town of Bethlehem,
How still we see thee lie!
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by;
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light;
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee to-night.

For Christ is born of Mary,
And gathered all above,
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love.
O morning stars, together
Proclaim the holy birth!
And praises sing to God the King,
And peace to men on earth.

How silently, how silently,
The wondrous gift is given!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of his heaven.
No ear may hear his coming,
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive him, still
The dear Christ enters in.

Where children pure and happy
Pray to the blessed Child,
Where misery cries out to thee,
Son of the mother mild;
Where charity stands watching
And faith holds wide the door,
The dark night wakes, the glory breaks,
And Christmas comes once more.

O holy Child of Bethlehem!
Descend to us, we pray;
Cast out our sin and enter in,
Be born in us to-day.

The great glad tidings tell;

When flowers were a-bloomin'
Sweet Willie on his deathbed lay
For the love of Barbara Allen

He sent his servant to the town
The town where she did dwell in
Saying ""Master dear has sent me here
It remained for Barbara Allen""

Then slowly slowly she got up
And slowly she went to him
And all she said when she got there
""Young man, I think you're dying""

""Oh don't you remember the other day
When we were in the tavern?
You drank your health to the ladies there
And you slighted Barbara Allen""

He turned his face unto the wall
He turned his back upon her
""Adieu! Adieu! To all my friends
Be kind to Barbara Allen""

She looked to the east, She looked to the west
She saw his corpse a-comin'
""Oh sit him down for me"" she cried
""That I may gaze upon him""

The more she looked the more she grieved
She bursted out to cryin'
Sayin' ""pick me up and carry me home
For I feel like I am dyin'""

They buried Willie in the old churchyard
And Barbara in the new one
From Willie's grave there grew a rose
From Barbara's a green briar

Collecting tickets from everyone there
And finally reaching the side of the boy
He gruffly demanded his fare

""But I'll pay you back someday""
""Then I'll put you off at the next stop we make""

And I thought of angels as I saw her there

Though life has been bitter she'd live it again
And carry that cross that is more than her share

It wouldn't take much just to gladden her heart
Just some small remembrance on somebody's part
A letter would brighten her empty life there

Who'd think they owned heaven if she was their own
They'd never be willing to let her sit there

I hope your mail always fails to reach you
Until you want to hear from me
I hope your wristwatch goes berserk

I hope your phone will never ring & you can never sing
I hope your car doesn't start, cannot move
Until you want to be with me

I hope your brand new dress gets torn
But I'm not angry, just forlorn
I'll make a voodoo dance to fit with bats & owls
We'll haunt your house on rattle chains
We'll hang around until you call my name

And tell me that you want me back again

I hope your luck will get stuck on black cats

The Everly Brothers,"We hold hands in the movie show
So they say that we're old fashioned
Or we stroll beneath the silvery moon
And we carve our initials in the old oak tree.
That's old fashioned.
That's the way love should be.

We enjoy sitting side by side
In the booth at the ice cream parlor
Where we play the nickelodeon
And we dance when we hear our favorite melody.
That's old fashioned.
That's the way love should be.

It's a modern changing world
Everything is moving fast.
But when it comes to love I like
What they did in the past.

I'm the kind who loves only one
So the boys say I'm old fashioned.
Let them laugh, honey I don't mind.

The Everly Brothers,"It's a nickel for the fiddler
It's a nickel for his tune
It's a nickel for the tambourine
Kind of afternoon
It's a high holiday on the 21st of June
And it's country music in the park
And everybody's ruined

It's fountains full of dogs and kids
And it's freaky apple pie
It's the ones just come to play
And it's the ones just passin' by
It's coats of many colours
And it almost makes me cry
It's ice cream on a stick
And it's something you can't buy

It's a fiddler from Kentucky
Who swears he's 83
And he's fiddled every contest
From here to Cripple Creek
It's old ones and it's young ones
And it's plain they have agreed
That it's country music in the park

The Everly Brothers,"Alone in a barroom, a young girl is sitting
And smiling at nothing at all
And she stares now and then at the eyes of the men
In the mirror that hangs on the wall

She's waiting for someone and knowing there's no one
Who cares if she comes or she goes
Just a soul in the shadows the world never sees
She's somebody nobody knows

Someone no one's ever known
Cryin' where no one can hear
Somebody's dyin' alone
In a city where nobody cars

Down in the gutter, an old man had fallen
Like someone the world threw away
And the late crowd was leaving and nobody even
Took time to look down where he lay

The old man was crying and helplessly tryin'
To wipe off the stain from his clothes
Just a soul in the shadows that life left behind
He's somebody nobody knows

Someone no one's ever known
Cryin' where no one can hear
Somebody's dying alone
In a city where nobody cares
In a city where nobody cares

When we were in the tavern?
You drank your health to the ladies there

She saw his corpse a-comin'
""Oh, sit him down for me"", she cried

She looked as though she'd been a'cryin' half of the night

All the things I've done and how it's been
And I can't help believin' in my own mind
I know I'm gonna hate to see it end.
I've seen a lot of sunshine, slept out in the rain
Spent a night or two all on my own
I've known my lady's pleasures had myself some friends
Spent a time or two in my own home.

I have to say it now it's been a good life, all in all,
It's really fine to have a chance to hang around.
Lie there by the fire and watch the evening tire,
While all my friends and my old lady, sit and pass a pipe around
(alt- sit and watch the sun go down)
And talk of poems and prayers and promises
And things that we believe in
How sweet it is to love someone,
How right it is to care.
How long it's been since yesterday,
What about tomorrow and what about our dreams
And all the memories we share.

Days they pass so quickly now, the nights are seldom long
Time around me whispers when it's cold.
The changes somehow frightens me, still I have to smile
It turns me on to think of growing old.
Although my life's been good to me, there's still so much to do
So many things my mind has never known
I'd like to raise a family, I'd like to sail away
And dance across the mountains on the moon.

How right it is to care.

 Down in the Tennessee hills
Aint' no smoggy smoke on Rocky Top

The Everly Brothers,"I can see the turning of the key
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me
I thought that he was right but he's afraid
But something's telling me I wear the ball and chain

My patron saint is fighting with the ghost
He's always off somewhere when I need him most
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill
But my heart is telling me I love you still

Everybody's wearin' a disguise
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes
But me I can't cover what I am
Wherever the children go I'll follow them

I march in the parade of liberty
But as long as I love you I'm not free
How long must I suffer such abuse?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?

We sat in an empty theatre and we kissed
I asked you please to cross me off your list
My head tells me it's time to make a change
But my heart is telling me ""I love you, but you're strange""

So one more time at midnight near the wall
Take off your heavy makeup and your shawl
Won't you come down from the throne from where you sit?
Let me feel your love one more time, before I abandon it.

I see you in the street, I began to swoon
I love to see you dress before the mirror
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?",Abandoned Love
The Everly Brothers,"It was the Senior High School yearbook 
The class of '63 
I'll never forget the way you gave 
Your book and pen to me 
It was all talked out and settled 
You new I'd understand 
A girl with dreams as big as yours 
Just had to make some plans 

So I turned to your best picture 
Most likely to succeed 
The only one in the whole damn book 
That didn't show you with me 
And it said that you liked inner strength 
So I tried to be true to form 
And I hid my teenage broken heart 
Instead I signed this poem 

I hope you always drive a Cadillac 
I hope you always drink champagne 
I hope you always shine with the sunshine 
I hope you never have to face the rain 
Unless the clouds are lined with silver 
May every heart you meet be gold 
And may you find the world as kind as you've been told 

At the ten year class reunion 
They read your personal note 
And displayed your cover photograph 
In your full length sable coat 
But the words underneath the picture 
Were what mattered most to me 
There was something in between the lines 
That no one else could see... 

It said
I always drive a Cadillac 
I always drink champagne 
And if you make time while the sun shines 
You never have to face the rain 
I travel fast because I go alone 
Everybody gets bought and sold 
And I wondered if you'd really become that cold 

That was the last word anyone heard from you 
Until I got your card today 
A single line and signature 
That said ""I'm coming home to stay"" 
I wonder what life has done to you 
I wonder why you thought of me 
But if you stop by to say hello 
I wonder what you'll think if you see 

An old ragged high school yearbook 
That falls open to just one page 
With a picture of a young girl's face 
Full of beauty, dreams and rage 
But the words underneath the picture 
Is the verse that's still so true 
It's the one I swore no one would read 
Unless I showed it to you 

I hope you always drive a Cadillac 
I hope you always drink champagne 
And you'll carry my heart wherever you go 
Even if I never see you again 
But if you bring it back home to me 
Maybe then it'll mean you know 
That the strongest love's the love that let's you go... 

I hope you always drive a Cadillac...",Always Drive a Cadillac

In love's sweet innocence

The Everly Brothers,"No one can make my sunshine smile

She goes out seven nights a week
But she's unhappy all the whi-ile
Each night a different guy-uy
Does his very best to try, but
No one can make my sunshine smile

My sunshine used to smile for me
But then she traded me for sty-yle
Now she's got Romeo
Who'll buy her fancy clothes, but
No one can make my sunshine smile

Once her smile could light up the room
And make the sun look dim
Her laugh in her eyes went away
Her makin' my day begin

But since she said goodbye to me
She hasn't smiled for quite a while
I was just her little clown
But since I'm not around, well

Is hollow and thin
The sound of tears falls on my ears
Just how it all went wrong is not very clear
My pillow is cold, I feel the fear

I don't wanna love you
But I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
Something in my heart tells me be still
(Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba)

I don't want to love you
But I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
I don't want to love you
But I will, I will, I will, I will
(I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will)

It's out of my hands now, beyond my mind
I don't understand now, my eyes are blind
It's sad to discover what's under the cover
Of their eyes you know

A smile that's blinding is most [unverified]

You dim the lights, I see the tears

I don't wanna love you

I Wonder If I Care As Much
As I did before........

Last night I cried myself to sleep
For the one that makes me weep,
I dried my eyes to greet the day,
And wondered why I have to pay.

The tears that I have shed by day
Give relief and wash away,
The mem´ry of the life before,
I wonder if I´ll suffer more.

[Chorus]

My pride is made to say forgive,
and take the blame for what you did,
It´s your mistake I´m thinkin´ of,
I wonder if I´m still in love.

My heart can´t thrive on misery,
My life it has no destiny,
When things get more
Than I can bear,
I ask myself ´Do I still care?´

      I like the Spider and the Diving Bell

      The ferris wheel

      I'll ride the Rockoplane or the Tilterwhirl
      It wasn't on these rides I lost my girl
      Way up high is where I lost her
      On a ferris wheel

      Pretty faces squeal by your coloured lights
      I saw someone steal her kiss from her that night

      I'll pay my fair and ride the bumper cars
      Those turning cars won't make the teardrops start

The Everly Brothers,"There was a morning train used to come on through
When this sleepy town was alive
And ev'ry Sunday we would come and see
Some mighty fancy people arrive
Ooohh, they arrived aboard the milk train
(La-la-la-la-la-la la)

There was a well dressed lady from the city
Used to always give me her smile
And she looked so fine, she was sweet and kind
She let me get to know her a while
Ooohh, for a little while
Back when the milk train used to rumble my shack
Used to stop outside o' my door
But now the milk train doesn't stop by here anymore

And I wander down that rusty old track
Like a lonely old-timer out of my mind
Lookin' for that lady who was sweet and kind to me

Used to stop outside o' my door
But now the milk train doesn't come by here anymore
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)

Now the only thing to come on through
Is a Jimmy-John now and then
And I dream of the day she'll come back this way
And let me get to know her again

Used to stop outside o' my door

Was too large for the shelf
So it stood ninety years on the floor
It was taller by half
Than the old man himself
Though it weighed not a pennyweight more
It was bought on the morn
Of the day that he was born
And was always his treasure and pride
But it stopped short
Never to go again
When the old man died

Ninety years without slumbering
Tick, tock, tick, tock
His life seconds numbering
Tick, tock, tick, tock
It stopped short

In watching its pendulum
Swing to and fro
Many hours had he spent while a boy
And in childhood and manhood
The clock seemed to know
And to share both his grief and his joy
For it struck twenty-four
When he entered at the door
With a blooming and beautiful bride
But it stopped short

Not a servant so faithful he found
For it wasted no time
And had but one desire
At the close of each week to be wound.

And its hand never hung by its side

And we knew that his spirit
Was pluming his flight
That his hour of departure had come

With a soft and muffled chime
As we silently stood by his side

I saw an old mother with silvery hair
She seemed so neglected by those who should care

And I thought of angels as I saw her there

Though life has been bitter she'd live it again

As I did before 

Last night I cried myself to sleep 
For the one that makes me weep 
I dried my eyes to greet the day
And wondered why I had to pay 

The tears that I have shed by day 
Give relief and wash away 
The memory of the night before 
I wonder if I'll suffer more 

I wonder if I care as much 
As I did before 

My pride is made to say ""Forgive"" 
And take the blame for what you did 
It's your mistake I'm thinking of
I wonder if I'm still in love

My life, it has no destiny 
When things get more than I can bear

She made it with a bang
Accordin' to the story in the paper this mornin'
Jenny is the leader of a teenage gang

Jenny has a brother and he's hot on my trail
Her daddy wants to ride me out of town on a rail
I hope I'll be around when Jenny gets out of jail
Poor Jenny

I went downtown to see her, she was locked in a cell
She wasn't very glad to see me, that I could tell
In fact, to tell the truth, she wasn't lookin' too well
Poor Jenny

Her eye was black, her face was red, her hair was a fright
She looked as though she'd been a'cryin' half of the night
I told her I was sorry, she said ""Get out of sight""
Poor Jenny

It seems a shame that Jenny had to go get apprehended, a heckuva fate
This party was the first one she ever had attended
It had to happen on our very first date

Jenny has a brother and he's hot on my trail
Her daddy wants to ride me out of town on a rail
I hope I'll be around when Jenny gets out of jail

Though life has been bitter she'd live it again
And carry the cross that is more than her share

It wouldn't take much to gladden her heart
Just some small remembrance on somebody's part
A letter would brighten her empty life there
Rockin' alone in an old rockin' chair

I know some kids in an orphan's home
Who think they owned heaven if she was their own
They'd never be willing to let her sit there
Rockin' alone in an old rockin' chair
I look at her and I think what a shame
The ones who forgot her she loves just the same
And I think of angels as I see her there

Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness, hello loneliness
I think I'm-a gonna cry-why
Bye bye love, bye bye sweet caress, hello emptiness
I feel like I could di-ie
Bye bye my love goodby-eye

There goes my baby with-a someone new
She sure looks happy, I sure am blue
She was my baby till he stepped in
Goodbye to romance that might have been

I'm-a through with romance, I'm a-through with love
I'm through with a'countin' the stars above
And here's the reason that I'm so free

In and out, of a sleep 
Behind the wheel, black eyes

Find your angel, lose your hobby
Everybody, you gotta do something right
If you find love hold on tight

don't push, your love away
Don't push, your love away

then on the walk on my way back home
I get a call from a friend on the telephone
He says come here I've got this girl to see
But beware, love isn't always free
Upon first glance, I got so hungry
Forbidden fruits, you gotta taste them
I took one bite, we all take chances
Poison lips, doomed romances

don't push, your love away (don't push your love away)
Don't push, your love away (don't push your love away)

a kiss of death, on the door
That's what you get, for takin home a whore
I shouldn't say that, it doesn't sound nice
Faith removes my fear sometimes
I'm too shy, you're too sharp
Together we can work eachother out
Loves too quick, she's always been
We're in your bed, drunk with adrenaline

don't push, your love away (don't push your love away)
Don't push, your love away (don't push your love away)

and I can see better days
We can share, love can save
You can hide in yourself
We can go our separate ways

and I've seen better days
Pass me by in a haze
And we've seen better days
Pass us by in a haze
I've seen better days

It's my life and I'ma live it like I want to

Check it
Another day another dolla
Is the reality of my mentality
Otherwise don't even botha
You see my father was a wise old man
Always creatin the plan
For me to conquer this land
He said I am what I am
So be the best that I can
And if them others don't like it
Then why should I give a damn (huh)
Maybe so cause when his life wasn't right
My mother picked up them pieces
And continued on with the fight
So now it's plain to me
It ain't no game to me
See mom and dad corrected math
1 and 1 equal 3
4 and 5 I count my sister and brother
Stay alive till we die
And don't you ever be worried
Cuz I'm down with a ride
Through peaks and valleys to Cresent Hills
Tumble down I'll set a new ground for Jack and Jill
Ever wonder what put the thunder deeply in my eyes
Take a look and you'll find a sunshine

The Eyeliners,"Last night*San Francisco
Tonight we're in LA
30 Days untils I see you
Hearing your voice is not good enough
I wish I could be seeing you tonight

I'm thinking of the time
That I saw you last
Time has passed me by too fast
I think of yesterday
It seems so very far away
I wonder if you think of me
I wish you were here with me

So here we go-c'mon let's go

Last night*New York City
Tonight*Pittsburg, PA
20 Days until I see you
Hearing your voice is not good enough
I wish I could be seeing you tonight

The days turn into weeks, Weeks to a month
And you're still the one I'm thinking of
We're driving farther, but we're getting closer everyday
Blut still we're having so much fun
It feels like it has just begun

So here we go-c'mon let's go

Last night we're in Chicago
Tonight we're in Greenbay
10 Days until I see you
Hearing your voice is not good enough
I wish I could be seeing you
Tonight you seem so far away
But I call you 'cause you say
You stop, drop everything
When the phone begins to ring

How are you today?
Is everything okay?
Before you go, there's one thing you should know
That there's no one that I'd rather go with to a
Punk Rock Show

Hearing your voice is not good enough
I wish I could be seeing you tonight




",See You Tonight
The Eyeliners,"If you need a friend,
Don't look to a stranger,
You know in the end, I'll always be there.
And when you're in doubt,
And when you're in danger,
Take a look all around,
And I'll be there.

I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say.
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be.
But if you'll wait around a while,
I'll make you fall for me, I promise, I promise you I will.

When your day is through, and so is your temper,
You know what to do, I'm gonna always be there.
Sometimes if I shout, it's not what's intended.
These words just come out, with no gripe to bear.

I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say.
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be.
But if you'll wait around a while,
I'll make you fall for me, I promise, I promise you I will.

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

The way you run my life
But you always insist on another little
Twist of the knife

Your lips I can't resist
Your eyes they hypnotize
With an endless supply of bullets to bite
So every day I can take another little
Twist of the knife

Your lips I can't resist
Your eyes they hypnotize
With an endless supply of bullets to bite
So every day I can take another little
Twist of the knife

Well a man takes an ounce of dignity
And a pound of foolish pride
And he gives it up for a woman like you
To keep her satisfied

[Chorus: x2]

It's a shame
It's a shame, shame, shame
It's a shame
It's a shame, shame, shame, shame , shame

If you don't do it quick, we'll have to operate

Staring at the ceiling thinking just my luck 
Better roll back over why get up

Well I can't quit drinking, I'm nervous all the time 
When I wake up, it's like a ton lead on my mind

I remember a gun and calling somebody's bluff 
I better duck under the cover why get up

The Faint,"Feel the vapor pressure drop
As the dark steam pours out the entrance
Real cold world is swirling into a club
That keeps the real life world out

Where every sense seems deathly
Weak from the frozen time you spent in transit
The glass dance world flickers on
And the low end thaws your anxious body

Maybe I feel detached, I may just look too shy
It's a disinterest not that I'm a timid guy
I call them bodies but they are attentive too
I feel the social glare I feel the attitude

Watch as mirrors clear themselves
With the breath of frigid air that eased in
Made up babies all rotate
As a siren spins a beam of amber

Time sliced beat by beat in a row
In a club, in a line, in the city
The glass dance world flickers on
Because the cycle happens enough

A baby falls out warm, it's screaming for its life
An infant tries to dance as it grows up then dies
That's simplified but, uh, when your complexion dries
You wake up cold and think, you wish it'd been this way

The Faint,"I steal the notes from other bands.
I fill their shoes with wet cement.
I make you think of certain things
And when you talk the things you'll say,

I'm pretty sure of what you want.
I bet you want the same as me.
You want to think of something smart,
Something someone would repeat,

but I'm giving up on all that fuss.
I'm gonna tell you how it is.
Then, when you get your turn to talk
I hope your microphone is off

And the critics go, ""Whoa...yeah...yeah...""
They'll go, ""Whoa...yeah...shotgun...""

But, for now just watch the screen.
Let me control the things you think.
You'd like to think you could resist,
But you're being hypnotised by this.

Think of the clock you thought up.
How it's wagging back and forth.
How you're hypnotised by us.
Are you studying my pores?

When my hand snaps you'll wake up
To your daily concerns.
I'm counting backwards in your head.
You're letting me do all the work.

",I Disappear [Album Version]
The Faint,"In the beginning there was semen,
In a deep mound of flesh,
And a crest that traveled,
On a wave of their own mess.

Through a tunnel of mucus,
And onto a vault,
With tourists and traffic,
I just paced myself.

Not I as my whole self,
Just the half that I had,
Before greeting the rest,
Of my better half.

A connection was made,
Through the shared love of science,
And vows were taken,
A seat was hired.

A cavern of fluid,
Brought shape to my hide,
In the months that remain,
To the time of my life.

Add flash for the reason,
Was spilling from the crack,
To the palms of the doctor,
To a towel full of scraps.

My brains wouldn't fit,
Through organ sex,
An incision was made,
With a scalpel and mess.

I should have noticed the beauty,
And not how it hurt,
Wet like a cherry,
In the bloodbath of birth.",Birth

This is the tale of his replica.
Name was J. Temperance
Only two did not hate him
Because peasants fear local indifference
Pet shop and the vet, Cameron.
One night vet is called out
From his overpaid leisure
To Temperance household, their limit ran out
And phoned his wife in terror.
The next bit is hard to relate.
(There are no read-outs to this part of the track.)
The new born thing hard to describe
Like a rat that's been trapped inside
A warehouse face, near a city tide
Brown sockets, purple eyes
A bed with rubbish from disposal barges
Brown uncovered no changeling,
As the birth was witnessed.
Only one person could do this:
Yes, it's Cameron
And the thing was in the
Impression of J. Temperance.

It just goes to show

I got no nerves left Monday morning
And I think I'll cut my dick off
The trouble it got me in
Went home to my slum canyon
On my way I looked up
I saw turrets of Victorian wealth
I saw John the ex-fox
Sleeping in some outside bogs
There's a silent rumble
In the buildings of the night council
It's a meeting of controllers
Who drive right through the gates
In white roll-tops

And I guess this just goes to show
The lie dream of the casino soul

I'm a bit jagged right now
In a tongue-tired, wired state
Cause Sunday morning dancing
I had an awake dream
I was in the supervision dept.
Of a bigtown store
Security floors one to four
They had cameras in the clothes dummies.
A man came up to them
He wanted sex in the dummies eyes
Then came up the cry:
""Security, mobilized!""
Meanwhile in the sticks
Proles rich, dance in cardboard pants
And I guess this goes to show

Via the ocean - plague came
Plague came & we're not the same
All around is pure tension
Beliefs and tears now & again
From where has this great sadness came
From sou'west flew plague
From northwest plague came 

I laughed at chicks with frustration
Fear of plague has sent us home
For love at least of our dear mum
Father takes it in his stride
Says 'back in the closet, son'
Was it ocean brought the plague?
Over the ocean came plague 

Plague came, nothing is the same
All there is is death and pain
Hearts now broken on our beach
[Love dissolved as they do up]
Love dissolved by Haitian sun
Did South Atlantic bring plague?
What evil ocean brought plague? 

Plague flew up from an ocean
From satan's tree and his baboon
A body's waste 'neath a gibbous moon
Rancid kid drowned in lagoon
From still blue ocean came plague
From Caribbean plague came 

Plague came in that Satan made
And our friends became deranged
Secret glamrock, gleeful hat
We stock Far Corporation
Glamrock family leisure zone 

It was an evil plague 
They sparked up and they built the boat
Put wind in its grim sail

The German athletic star was continually ill.
For months doctors were puzzled.
The star would complain of the smell in his room.
On visiting him this was found to be true.
An odor resembling hot-dogs permeated the whole bedroom.

A solution was only discovered by my closely
Watching his brother Gert.
Gert was handsome, well-meaning, but slightly a careless type.
Not malicious, I hope you understand and grasp.
No chance.

But on returning from his clerical job, Gert 
Would park his Volkswagen at the end of the day
Willy-nilly in the driveway, usually the wrong way round,
So that the exhaust fumes would flow upwards right through
The open windows of the athletic star's upstairs bedroom.
(Carburetor)

I also discovered that Gert would turn his engine
Over for up to an hour. I don't know why.
Citizens in my street are also
Partial to this.

I've got a load of hogs and they've got to go.""
""I'll see you when I get back from Chicago .

She said ""John, you know I love you, I wish you wouldn't go,
Send your babies some money. They're hungry and cold.""
The last thing she said, and then she hung up, was
""John you gave up my loving to drive an old truck.""

I made my trip up to the depot
I was gone two months cause I shot up my dough
When I got home my family was gone
The best friend I had rung my telephone.
He said ""John, I guess you wonder 'bout your babies and wife
Pneumonia got your babies and your wife took her life.""

The Fall,"Day by day.
The moon gains on me.
Day by day.
The moon gains on me.

Purchased pair of flabby wings.
I took to doing some HOVERING.
Here is a list of incorrect things.

HOVERED mid-air outside a study.
An academic kneaded his chin,
sent in the dust of some cheap magazines.
His academic rust, could not burn them up.

Recruited some gremlins.
To get me clear of the airline routes.
I paid them off with stuffing from my wings.
They had some fun with those cheapo airline snobs.

The stuffing loss made me hit a timelock.
I ended up in the eighteen sixties.
I've been there for one hundred and twenty five years.
A small alteration of the past. Can turn time into space.

Ended up under Ardwick Bridge.
With some veterans from the U.S. Civil War.
They were under Irish patronage.
We shot dead a stupid sergeant,
but I got hit in the crossfire.
The lucky hit made me hit a time lock.

But, when I got back.
The place I made the purchase, no longer exists
I'd erased it under the bridge.

Day by day.
The moon came towards me
By such things.
The moon came towards me.

So now I sleep in ditches.
And hide away from nosey kids.
The wings rot and feather under me.
The wings rot and curl right under me.
A small alteration of the past.
Can turn time into space.
Small touches can alter more than a mere decade.

'We drove the Moors back into the sea and now we ride their waves!'
And a little bit of something about the positive vibes of the sea
'I feel at one with the waves!'

The Farm,"Call the disused derelict buildings
They tell of stories of time gone by
They tell of broken dreams & promises
Of all those forgotten lies

And the waste grounds of a city proud
Tell the story you know too well
Just sit back for a while and listen to the story I tell

You tell the story
You tell the story
You tell the story
You heard ten times before

You wait for the day it must come soon
To get you away from your feelings of gloom
There's no real hope and there's none on it's way
You only survive from day to day

You tell the story
You tell the story
You tell the story
You heard ten times before

You tell a story of a city proud
You tell the story you shout it out loud
The same old story you wanna hear no more
The same old story you've heard ten times before",Tell the Story
The Farm,"I open my eyes and what do I see
Four walls staring at me
Will you ever remember
Will you ever remember
I'm thinking of you all the while
To see your face and see your smile
Stand by me while I'm away
Stand by me for another day
Very, very, very emotional
(Don't you ever go away)
Stay free, stay free, stay free
All of your days
You make me happy you make me smile
I wanna be with you all the while
Will you ever remember

The Farm,"Remember boy that your forefather's died
Lost in millions for a country's pride
But they never mention the trenches of Belgium
When they stopped fighting and they were one

A spirit stronger than war was at work that night
December 1914 cold, clear and bright
Countries' borders were right out of sight
When they joined together and decided not to fight

[Repeat: x2]
All together now
All together now
All together now, in no man's land

The same old story again
All those tears shed in vain
Nothing learned and nothing gained
Only hope remains

[Repeat: x2]
All together now
All together now
All together now
In no man's land

The boys had their say they said no
Stop the slaughter let's go home, let's go, let's go",All Together Now [Album Mix]
The Farm,"This looks like my day
To myself I'd often say
The winds of change are here
Don't give up don't have any fear
'Cause you know you've got it

Don't ever let them push you around

The Farm,"I know a man get in touch if you can
I know a man a very incredible man
He's a big tall man in a big black hat
A wolf in sheep's clothing yes he looks like that

You are what you are

The Farm,"You were working as a waitress in a cocktail bar
When I met you
I picked you out, I shook you up, and turned you around
Turned you into someone new
Now five years later on you've got the world at your feet
Success has been so easy for you
But don't forget it's me who put you where you are now
And I can put you back down too

Don't, don't you want me?
You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me
Don't, don't you want me?
You know I don't believe you when you say that you don't need me
It's much too late to find
You think you've changed your mind
You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry

Don't you want me baby? Don't you want me - oh
Don't you want me baby? Don't you want me - oh

I was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar
That much is true
But even then I knew I'd find a much better place
Either with or without you
The five years we have had have been such good times
I still love you
But now I think it's time I lived my life on my own
I guess it's just what I must do

Don't you want me baby? Don't you want me - oh
Don't you want me baby? Don't you want me - oh","Don't You Want Me [7"" Mix]"
The Farm,"You remember when I stood by the wall
You asked me when I thought the wall would fall
That was less than two years ago
Impossible to see impossible to know

When the people make up their minds
Courage and strength they will always find

Nobody can really lead the way
When the people want to have their say

Won't you tell me how long
How long
Won't you tell me how long
Must this go on

Ivory towers and those meaningless words
Recited by people like a well known verse
We're into the 90's and the pain goes on
Listen to the people with their freedom songs

Won't you tell me how long
How long
Won't you tell me how long
Must this go on

Won't you tell me how long
How long
Won't you tell me how long
Must this go on (on and on and on,
On and on and on, on and on and on,
On and on and on)",How Long [DVD][Live]
The FARM,"The other day I called myself complaining
Now my boss has got me working over time
Then the stranger who was sitting there beside me
Said,I spent all day in the unemployment
Are there open shifts, are they hiring on
I'll work any hours even all night long
If you could put a good word in for me

Every time you think you got it bad
You can find someone who's got it worse
All the things you take for granted now
They started out as blessings first
If you got someone who loves you
And a steady job that puts food on the table
If you're strong and able
Man, be grateful

We complain about how much it's gonna cost us
To feel our 20 something thousand dollars cars
And living in the land of milk and honey
It's so easy to forget how lucky we are
We can work hard and buy a patch of dirt
And on Sunday morning we can go to church
And pray for those who don't have it as good as you

Every time you think you got it bad
You can find someone who's got it worse
All the things you take for granted now
They started out as blessings first
If you got someone who loves you
And a steady job that puts food on the table
If you're strong and able
Man, be grateful

Every time you think you got it bad
You can find someone who's got it worse
All the things you take for granted now
They started out as blessings first
If you got someone who loves you
And a steady job that puts food on the table
If you're strong and able
Man, be grateful",Be Grateful
