Red Norvo,"Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song
Red Norvo,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things
Red Norvo,"You're just too marvelous, too marvelous for words
Like glorious, glamorous and that old standby amorous
It's all too wonderful, I'll never find the words
That say enough, tell enough, I mean they just aren't swell enough

You're much too much and just too very, very
To ever be in Webster's Dictionary
And so I'm borrowing a love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous, too marvelous for words

You're much, you're too much and just too very, very
To ever be, to ever be in Webster's Dictionary
And so I'm borrowing a love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous, tell you that you're marvelous
Tell you that you're marvelous, too marvelous for words",Too Marvelous for Words [*]
Red Norvo,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When
Red Norvo,"Dear when you smiled at me, I heard a melody
It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me started a symphony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

'Twas like a breath of spring, heard a robin sing
About a nest set apart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies blue again
What else could I do again
Keep repeating through again
""I love you, love you""

I still recall the thrill, guess I always will
I hope 'twill never depart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies blue again
What else could I do again?
Keep repeating through again
""I love you, I do love you""

I still recall the thrill, I guess that I always will
I hope 'twill never depart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart",Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart

Red Norvo,"Just you, just me
Let's find a cozy spot
To cuddle and coo
 
Just us, just we
I've missed an awful lot
My trouble is you

What are your charms for?
What are my arms for?
Use your imagination!
Just you, just me
I'll tie a lover's knot
'Round wonderful you!","Just You, Just Me"
Red Norvo,"I let a song go out of my heart
It was the sweetest melody
I know I lost heaven 'cause you were the song

Since you and I have drifted apart
Life doesn't mean a thing to me
Please come back, sweet music, I know I was wrong

Am I too late to make amends?
You know that we were meant to be more than just friends, just friends

I let a song go out of my heart
Believe me, darlin', when I say
I won't know sweet music until you return some day

Red Norvo,"I was doing all right
Nothing but rainbows in my sky
I was doing all right
'Til you came by

Had no cause to complain
Life was as sweet as apple pie
Never noticed the rain
'Til you came by

But now whenever you're away
I can't sleep nights and suffer all the day
I just sit and wonder
If love isn't one big blunder

But when you hold me tight
Tingling all through, I feel somehow
I was doing all right
But I'm doing better than ever now

But now whenever you're away
I can't sleep nights and suffer all the day
I just sit and wonder
If love isn't one big blunder

But when you hold me tight
Tingling all through, I feel somehow
I was doing all right
But I'm doing, yes, I'm doing
I'm doing much better than ever now",I Was Doing All Right
Red Norvo,"Jeannine, I dream of lilac time
Your eyes, they beam in the lilac time
Your winning smile
And cheeks blushing like the rose
Yet all the while, you sigh when nobody knows
Jeannine, my queen of lilac times
When I return, I'll make you mine
For you and I, our love dream can never die
",Jeannine (I Dream of Lilac Time)
Red Norvo,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay",Love Is Here to Stay
Red Norvo,"This is my first affair, so please be kind
Handle my heart with care, oh, please be kind
This is all so grand, my dreams are on parade
If you'll just hold my hand, they'll never, ever fade

So tell me your love's sincere, oh, please be kind
Tell me I needn't fear, oh, please be kind
'cause if you leave me dear, I know my heart will lose its mind
If you love me, please be kind

Tell me your love's sincere, oh, please be kind

Red Norvo,"""Fall in love, fall in love"" says my heart,
""It's romance, take a chance"" says my heart.
But each time that I'm almost in your arms
This old school-teacher brain of mine
Keeps ringing in false alarms.
Then my head rules instead and I'm wise
To the schemes of that gleam in your eyes
so I kiss and run
But the moment we're apart
""Oh! You fool that was love!""
Says my heart",Says My Heart

Red Norvo,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 

Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 
Oh lady be good to me.","Oh, Lady Be Good"
Red Norvo,"Yesterday you came my way,
And when you smiled at me,
In my heart I felt a thrill you see,
That it was love at sight and
I was right to love you as I do.
Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know
I'm on your mind each place we go
They can't believe that you're in love with me.

I have always placed you far above me.
I just can't imagine that you love me.
And after all is said and done,
To think that I'm the lucky one.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

Skies are gray. I'm blue each day
When you are not around.
Ev'ry thing goes wrong, my dear I've found
But when you're by my side I fill with pride
For I'm so proud of you
It all seems too good to me to all be true

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know
I'm on your mind each place we go
They can't believe that you're in love with me.

I have always placed you far above me.

And after all is said and done,
To think that I'm the lucky one.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.",I Can't Believe That You're in Love With Me
Red Norvo,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April
Red Norvo,"I've got you under my skin.
I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
And I like you under my skin.",I've Got You Under My Skin
Red Norvo,"The moon was all aglow
But heaven was in your eyes
The night that you told me
Those little white lies

The stars all seemed to know
You didn't mean all those sighs
The night that you told me
Those little white lies

I try, but there's no forgetting
When evenin' appears
I sigh but there's no regretting
In spite of my tears

Who wouldn't believe those lips
Who wouldn't believe those eyes
The night that you told me
Those little white lies

I try, but there's no forgetting
When evenin' appears
I sigh but there's no regretting

Red Norvo,"You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die. 

You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".",Mood Indigo
Red Norvo,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies

Red Norvo,"You must have been a beautiful baby, 
You must have been a wonderful child 
When you were only startin' 
To go to kindergarten

An' when it came to winning blue ribbons, 
You must have shown the other kids how

Red Norvo,"I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance with You
Red Norvo,"I'm in the middle of solving a riddle that no one can do;
That goes for Albert Einstein, the League of Nations too,
So now my fine and feathered friend,
I'll leave it up to you.

If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers, 
How much do I love you?
Then what have I got to pick to turn the trick
And make you love me too?

If Simple Simon sat beside a shallow saucer
Tryin' to catch a whale
Then what have I got to try to make you buy
The heart I've got for sale?

How much wood would a wood-chuck chuck
If a wood-chuck could chuck wood?
I'd chuck double with no trouble
If it did me any good
If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers
I'll tell you what I'd do
I'd pick a peck of peppers
Sit beside a saucer
I'd even be a wood-chuck 
Chuck-in all I could chuck
Just to make you love me too.

So long so long so long he's back again

When I turned seventeen
We had passion, we had dreams
Thought the love we were fighting for
Was something holy, something more

When I turned twenty-one
We were outside on the run
When I walked out with my girl
We went halfway around the world

I dreamed I saw her standing there
Running for the boy inside the man
I was hit hard by the light so bright it burned
All at once I knew she'd understand
Boy inside the man
The boy inside the man
When I turned twenty-five
We were hungry, we had drive
When I turned much older then
When the boy was lost in pride

Now I just turned thirty-one
I have lost and I have won
Still I've kept my dreams alive
Cause the boy will never die

Running for the boy inside the man

Why I remember the first truck I drove
I was so proud I could hardly wait to get home to show my wife and my little boy
And my little boy was so excited like so when he saw his first snow
He wasn't old enough to say too many words
He just kept hollering goddyup go daddy giddyup go
So that's what I named the old truck Giddyup go
Oh things wasn't too bad of course I's gone a lot

I couldn't find out what happened nobody seemed to know
So from that day on it's been me and old Giddyup go

When up beside me pulled down a brand new diesel rig

And as she pulled around and back in front of me a big lump came in my throat
And my eyes watered like I had a bad old cold

Well I pushed old Giddyup go stayed right on him
Until the next truck stop where he'd pulled up
I waited till he went in and I offered to buy him a cup
Well we got to talkin' shop and I said
Now did you come by the name on your truck Giddyup go
Well he said I got it from my pop
Dad used to drive a truck that's what mom talked about a lot
You see I lost mom when I was just past sixteen and I lost all track of pop
Mom said he got the name from me
I shook his hand and told him that I had something I wanted him to see
I took him out to the old truck
And brushed off some of the dirt so the name would show
And his eyes got big and bright as he read Giddyup go
Oh we had a lot of things to talk about and buddy I felt like a king
And now we've just pulled back on old 66 and he's handled that big rig

And trembled at the likes of what I learned

I've looked into my mind while I was freezing
And asked myself the question who am I

And felt the kin to men who leave their wives
I've searched and finally found the perfect woman
And learned too late she never could be mine

And after about six years of being in and out,
I got home one day and found my wife and little boy gone;

Well we got to talking shop, and I said,
“How'd you come by that name on your truck -- Giddyup Go?”
“Well,” he said, “I got it from my pop.

That's what Mom talked about a lot.
You see, I lost Mom when I was just past 16,
And I lost all track of Pop.
Mom said he got the name from me.”

Well I shook his hand and told him
I had something I wanted him to see,
And took him out to the old truck,
And brushed off some of the dirt so the name would show.
And his eyes got big and bright
As he read “Giddyup Go.”

She never closed her eyes to sleep
Till we were all in bed
And on party nights till we came home
She always sat and read

We had little thought about it then
For we were young and gay
Just how much Mama worried
When we children were away

We only knew she never slept
While we were out at night
That she waited just to know
That we'd all come home alright

And sometimes when we'd stay away
Till 1 or 2 or 3
It seemed to us that Mama heard
The turning of the key

For always when we'd step inside
She'd call and we'd reply
We were all too young back then
To understand the reason why

Till the last one had returned
She always kept a light
For Mama couldn't sleep until
She'd kissed us all good night

She had to know we were safe
Before she went to rest
For she always feared the world might harm
The ones she loved the best

Once she said, ""When you are grown
To women and to men
Perhaps I'll sleep the whole night through
It might be different then""

So it seemed that night and day
We knew our mother's care
For always when we got back home
We found her waiting there

Then came the day
We were called together 'round her bed
""The children are all with ya now""
The kindly doctor said

Then in her eyes there gleamed again
That old-time tender light
That told that she waited
Just to know we made it home alright

She smiled that old familiar smile
And prayed to God to keep
Her children safe from harm throughout the years
And then she went asleep

My dream is a treasure that I'll always keep
I dreamed about Mama last night

Red Sovine,"If jesus came to your house, to spend a day or two.
If he came without warning, I wonder what you'd do.

Yes if Jesus came to your house, to spend a day or two.
If he came unexpected, just dropped in on you.
Ahh I know you'd give you nicest room, to such an honored guest.
And all the food you'd serve to him, would be your the best.
And you would keep reassuring him, that you're glad to have him there.
That serving him in your home, is joy beyond compare.
But when you saw him coming, would you meet him at the door,
With arms out stretched in welcome, to your heavenly visitor.
Or would you have to change you clothes, before you'd let him in.
Or hide some magazines, and put the bible where they had been.
Would you turn off the radio, and hope he hadn't heard.
And wish you hadn't uttered, that last loud hasty word.
Would you hide your worldly music, and put some hymn books out.
Could you just let Jesus walk right in, or would you rush about.
And I wonder, if the savior spent a day or two with you.
Would you go right on doing, the things you always do.
Would you go right on saying, the things you always say.
Would life for you continue, as it does from day to day.
Would your family conversations, keep up its normal pace.
And would you find it hard each meal to say a table grace.
Would you sing the songs you always sing,
And read the books you read.
And let him know the things on which you mind and spirit feed.
Would you take Jesus with you everywhere you planned to go.
Or maybe would you change your plans, for just a day or so.
Would you be glad for him meet your very closest friends.
Or hope that they'd stay away, until his visit ends.
Would you be glad to have him stay forever on and on.
Or would you sigh with great relief, when he at last was gone.
It might be interesting to know the things that you would do,
If Jesus came in person, to spend some time with you.

If Jesus came to your house, I wonder what you'd do.",If Jesus Came to Your House
Red Sovine,"Dear John, oh, how I hate to write
Dear John, I must let you know tonight
That my love for you has died away like grass upon the lawn
And tonight I wed another dear John

I was overseas in battle when the postman came to me
And he handed me a letter I was just as happy as I could be
For the fighting was all over and the battle have been won
Then I opened up the letter and that started, dear John

Dear John, oh, how I hate to write
Dear John, I must let you know tonight
That my love for you has died away like grass upon the lawn
And tonight I wed another dear John

Will you please send back my picture, my husband wants it now
And when I tell you who I'm wedding I know you won't care, dear anyhow
Now the ceremony has just started and tonight I'll wed your brother Don
Will you please wish us happiness forever, dear John?

She got a sandbox, In the backyard to play.
Sand was everywhere as she play and she laughed.

She got a bike to ride with all her friends.
She skinned both her knees, as she played and she laughed.

As I look out across at my beautiful lawn
The house is quiet, There's no children at play.
And I say to my wife.

Mr Angry neighbor yes I know just how you feel
Cause I've been taking your fruit but don't tell me I steal
I haven't been in your yard my tracks ain't on your ground
Your tree hangs over my fence the nights you're not around
I didn't jump the fence the fruit was offered free
I couldn't reach your apples if you just trimmed the tree
Well sure I've held your darling but Mister where's your sense
She's the one got lonely I didn't jump the fence

Now friend you see that little trail that runs between our home
These ain't the shoes that wore it there the nights that you were gone
So don't show me your anger or shout I stole a kiss

Red Sovine,"We just finished our dinner and
I'd gone in the den and turned on the TV.
When she walked in and kissed me
on the cheek like a million times before.
And she said ""Honey, I know It's late.
But if you don't mind, My shoppings gotten a little behind.
So I think I'll drive downtown to the grocery store.""

Well.. I didn't look up, Just nodded OK and asked her to
hand me an ashtray.
And when she did, I reached over and squeezed
her hand, And then she left.
And I shuddered a minute
At the thought of my world without her in it.
And I reassuringly sought the touch
of my wedding band.

Well.. I musta been dozing,
'cause I didn't hear the door.
And I thought now that's strange,
I've never done that before.
But I looked up, And she was standing by my chair.
""Kinda snucked in on me"" I said,
And she smiled and nodded her head.
And I told her that she looked just like an angel
standing there.

For a long moment she didn't say a thing.
And then she caressed her gold wedding ring.
And I thought I saw a tear drop in her eye.
""Honey, You'll never know how much I love you""
She said.

And I thought of the many years that we had been wed.
As I told her that no one could be as happy as I.
And then the strangest feeling filled the room.
Not one of happiness but one of gloom.
And for the first time in my life, I saw sadness in her face.
I reached out to touch her, and she drew away.
And she told be again, That ours was a love..
That time could never erase.

And then I thought I heard a thousand voices singing
But I realized it was the telephone ringing.
And that's when I saw the halo
Surround her pretty golden hair.

I turned trembling to the receiver and heard a cold voice
say there had been a wreck out on the highway.
And I knew that when I looked back, She wouldn't be there.
Because it was an angels way of saying our last goodbye.",The Last Goodbye

My world won't be the same since she's gone from me)

I have gone to visit the grave of a friend of mine and as I walked thru the grave yard
I noticed this man kneeling down by the grave of a child
And in his hand he held a big red rose and tears were streaming down his cheeks
I walked over and laid a hand on his shoulder and started to talk to him
And during the course of our conversation and in his broken English
This is the story just as he told it to me
He said to me Mister I've walked down the street today
And I passed about the big flower shop
I walked in and I asked the man in the shop I said boss how much is for one red rose
Then he looked at me with one big frown and he says it's one dollar please
But in a buyin' buyer was well dressed blonde lady walked in
And she says how much is for one red rose
And he looked at her with one big smile and he says ten cents
Now I said boss how come to you to charge me a dollar for the rose
And you charged the young lady only ten cents
Then he said look Mister you tell me why you want the rose
And maybe I give it to you for not
I said boss I'm a hard working man working a railroad and gonna make too much money
And I got a little girl and her name was Rosa o Rosa's just about this high boss
Every day when I'd come home from the work
A little Rosa come running to meet her papa
And she'd throw her little arms around my neck and say papa and I'd say Rosa
But one day boss I've come home from the work I don't see Rosa
I looked down by the railroad track and I see one big crowd
I'd go down and I pushed the crowd this a way and pushed the crowd that a way
There was at my feet lay my little Rosa and that's why I want the rose boss
I wanna put it on little Rosa's grave
Then man he didn't say not but he picked the biggest and the reddest rose
And he gave it to me
And I said thank you boss thank you very much

Red Sovine,"(Bringing Mary home)
I was driving down a lonely road on a dark and stormy night
When a little girl by the road side showed up in my head lights
I stopped and she got in the back and in a shaky tone
She said my name is Mary please won't you take me home
She must have been so frightened all alone there in the night
There was something strange about her cause her face was deathly white
She sat so pale and quiet there in the back seat all alone
I never will forget that night I took Mary home
I pulled into the driveway where she told me to go
Got out to help her from the car and opened up the door
But I just could not believe my eyes the back seat was bare
I looked all around the car but Mary wasn't there
A small light shown from the porch a woman opened up the door
I asked about the little girl that I was looking for
Then the lady gently smiled and brushed a tear away
She said it sure was nice of you to go out of your way
But thirteen years ago today in a wreck just down the road
Our darling Mary lost her life and we srill miss her so
So thank you for your trouble and the kindness you have shown
You're the thirteenth one who's been here bringing Mary home
You're the thirteenth one who's been here bringing Mary home

Red Sovine,"The highways that wind and wander over mountain and valleys deserts and plains
I guess I've drove about all of 'em
Cause for the past 25 years now the cab of a truck has been my home
And it'd be kinda hard for me to settle down and not be on the go
Why I remember the first truck I drove
I was so proud I could hardly wait to get home to show my wife and my little boy
And my little boy was so excited like so when he saw his first snow
He wasn't old enough to say too many words
He just kept hollering goddyup go daddy giddyup go
So that's what I named the old truck Giddyup go
Oh things wasn't too bad of course I's gone a lot
And after about six years I got home one day and found my wife and little boy gone
I couldn't find out what happened nobody seemed to know
So from that day on it's been me and old Giddyup go
I've made a lot of friends at all the truck stops
And some of 'em would kick me about my litle sign
Of course they knew where I got the name
Cause I told 'em about that little boy of mine
And how his first word about that old truck was Giddyup go
Today I was barrelin' down old 66 
When up beside me pulled down a brand new diesel rig
Both stacks of blowin' black coal
And as she pulled around and back in front of me a big lump came in my throat
And my eyes watered like I had a bad old cold
A little sign on the back of the truck that read Giddyup go
Well I pushed old Giddyup go stayed right on him 
Until the next truck stop where he'd pulled up
I waited till he went in and I offered to buy him a cup
Well we got to talkin' shop and I said
Now did you come by the name on your truck Giddyup go
Well he said I got it from my pop
Dad used to drive a truck that's what mom talked about a lot
You see I lost mom when I was just past sixteen and I lost all track of pop
Mom said he got the name from me
I shook his hand and told him that I had something I wanted him to see
I took him out to the old truck
And brushed off some of the dirt so the name would show
And his eyes got big and bright as he read Giddyup go
Oh we had a lot of things to talk about and buddy I felt like a king
And now we've just pulled back on old 66 and he's handled that big rig
Better than any gearjammer that I'd ever seen

Then we joined the crowd
I can't dance, took a chance
And right then we started
 
Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose
I fell and when I rose
I felt ashamed and told her 
That's the latest step, that's the latest step
That's the latest step, my honey
Notice all the pep, notice all the pep, notice all the pep
She said, ""Stop mumbling, tho you are stumbling
I like it just a little bit, just a little bit, quite a little bit""

Take a chance do this dance
They think it's a bear
People rave and they crave 
Just to do this step
Off they go, nice and slow

Will the answers follow
Or will the wind and rain
Predict tomorrow

Or will they combine
And dictate our fears
Feeding our minds
The violence here

We can end the apathy

When we enter the darkness

Will our heart lead the way
In the land of thoughtless
Or will you just fan the flames

Or will they combine

Redemption,"Anything we should know about your change? 
I still remember the sound of your voice calling out my name
And I still remember my face examining itself,
Knowing things would never be the same
I still remember your smiling face across a crowded room
I still remember, through the weathering of time,
That first embrace that sealed our doom
 
Your eyes stare at me from every storefront
And your voice calls to me from every restaurant
And your laughter pierces me as I stand beneath the open sky
And your absence murders me as I sleep perchance to die
Seems like to escape is what I ought to do,
But every road I take brings me back to you
 
I am frozen in the moment, clinging to your memory
And I don't want the ignorance
That a spotless mind would bring,
But I'm scared my dying breath may be your name
 
It's just like I sang to you:
Everyone knows that we live in a world
Where people give bad names to beautiful things
And if it's really true that people should leav
Once they've got what they came for,
I certainly hope that you're holding it close to you now
 
I am frozen in the moment, clinging to your memory
And I don't want the ignorance
That a spotless mind would bring,
But I'm scared my dying breath may be your name
 
I still remember the sunlight on your face that warm November day
I still remember my heartbeat quickened by desire,
Unaware of prices I would pay
I still remember the closing door the night we said goodbye
I still remember losing you for good
And knowing that a part of me had died
Seems like to escape is what I ought to do,
But every road I take brings me back to you
 
I am frozen in the moment
(Please do not forget me)
Clinging to your memory
('Cause I will not forget you)
And I don't want the ignorance
That a spotless mind would bring,
But I'm scared my dying breath may be your name
Please let me be frozen in the moment
Let me hold on to those memories
And I pray that things will be all right

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past

Like the kicker in a julep or two

Without dancing with me

Redman,"Look! Up in the sky! 
It's a bird... 
It's a plane!
Hee hee hee hee, naw! It's Sooperman Lover, baby! 

Daddy, Daddy! 
Would you please read us a story? 
Alright, get over here and sit yo big ass down  
Lemme tell you about the Sooperman Lover... 

A yo, I was out to lunch and shit 
Puffin' on a blunt to get my head ready
Boogie'n to my Walkman 
With an ""S"" on my chest 
(Bust a move!) 
Yes I'm a super hero, don't forget 
I smoke mad niggas 
So to hell with cigarettes 
But anyway, 
Let's get back to this skit 
You know who the fuck I am 
So git off that ol' bull-shucks 
Lunchtime was up, (Fuck!!) 
Let me jet, or I'll collect unemployment bucks 
On the way back, black, 
I spotted this object, a stray cat 
Stuck in a tree 
With a tag that says that: 
""If found, 
Please return to this address"" 
(How did you see it)? 
Nigga! With my X-Ray eye set! 
Like ""Pchooooww!"" 
I jetted to the closest phone booth 
Quick fast, 
I dipped into my Sooperlover suit... 

(I can leap, 
Tall buildings 
In a single bound...) 

Boom!! 
Right through the fuckin' phone-booth ceiling! 
(It's a plane!) 
Naw, Sooperman Lover's the name 
I can slam King Kong 
And pick up freight trains 
On a mission, 
To save this cat that was wishin' 
He was in his litter 
Watchin' Fritz on channel 6
Relaxin' 
Feet cocked-up just a little 
With a cold cocktail 
And a bowl, of tender vittles 
I snatched, him 
Took off through the air like a pigeon 
Quick so he won't start 
Meowin' and bitchin' 
The letter in cat's tag address
Said the projects 
(Elevator's broke!) 
So I had to take the back steps 
(Knock, Knock) 
The door opened 
Then my eyes swole 
From this bad ass dame (Damn!) 
Sippin' a quart of ""Old Gold"" 
""Yo, is this your cat?"" 
""Awww, yes! Where'd you find him at?"" 
""He was stuck in a tree, 
Around Uptown Manhattan"" 
""Well how the hell did you save him? 
Are you Police Undercover?"" 
""Naw baby, 
The ""S"" on my chest stands for:"" 

[Chorus:] 
Sooperman Lover (Yeah!) 
Baby call him the Sooperman Lover 
Something wrong... 
Something wrong, indeed 
Something wrong. Yes, yes indeed... 

She was grateful 
Lookin' for ways to repay me 
No money, 
A donut, and some...um coffee maybe? 
Of course 
What kind of sauce did I take? 
Make my donut jelly 
And my coffee Sanka 
We sat, 
Unhooked the cape from the back 
She felt my arms 
'Cause my pythons looked stacked 
""Goddamn, Sooperlover! 
Your shit looks thick 
Tell me, how strong are you 
With muscles like this? (You bad motherfucker!)"" 

(I'm stronger than a locomotive) 

I'll keep hittin ya like Rocky 
She ran to the room 
And came back with a 
Negligee, high-heeled shoes, 
Wit' a blunt in her mouth 
Ready to roll up, 
Hey hold up, she had the dollar folded up 
To mix the coke with the smoke 
Yo, she was no joke 
She took a sniff, 
Some got on her top lip 
That bitch stuck out her tongue 
And gave her top lip a lick 
And said ""Here baby, hit it."" 
""Naw baby, I ain't wit' it 
You'd need more than a body 
To make me want to hit that shit!"" 
But I'll hit the blunt 
So she took out her fronts 
Cracked the Philly 
Opened the bag and laid out the skunk 
Then I took a long pull 
It was hype outta sight 
We ran into the bedroom 
So I cracked my pants for head room 
Later, tossed the covers 
And oh, brother! I was wit' it 
Ready to hit it 
Asked my dick, ""Yo, wassup G?"" 
""Yo man, shit's thick"" 
Licked her down her belly 
And kissed her on her back 
Stuck my hands between the legs 
And I felt the ball sack 
As big as mine (Yo!) 
This bitch must be craze, 
So I threw my suit on 
And I was Swayze... 
'Cause I'm the:

Redman,"Make my funk, the P-Funk
I wants to get funked up

Make my funk the P funk, we thump
Lyrics that bounce the brain, make emcees jump
Sky high
Can't touch the level so why try?
Fall Guy compare me status to fly guy
Rough and rugged, and brother it takes ten to conquer
That's why I'm on probation
Ever since three, I cut throats of emcees
Mediocre lyricist who burnt with degrees
Of two-ten
Not from an oven, but MAC-10
A MAC-20 maybe if I didn't subtract ten
My background straight from a black mans culture
Want more, buy the video or Redman sculpture
For your mantle, damn you
Too hard to handle
E-Double slam once, and Redman slam two
Break hooks, earthquake shook the state of NJ
Okay, bust the big gate
For microphones that have swollen mic cords
PE fights for power
Redman fights for soul power
Funk is strong as a tree trunk
Ask me the flavor
Make mines the P funk

You could bet I drop heavy so girls grab your Kotex
I catch fits when I blitz a rhyme grit
And my lip gets to the point, to rip some mo' fly shit

Renegade rapper, rip when it's rhyme time
Punk push a pen and pencil when I'm pissed
Pack Pistol Posse, flow some more pro shit
Fee-Fi-Foe-Fum, funky to floor, ay
Fuck ya freak words for foreplay
Quickly, quiet is kept, never quack
On the Q-Tip I quote, I throw lines like a quarterback
A monster, murder motherfucks like Manson
A madman, who mutilize men with 9-M-M
Bullets blow bad, brother back to back I slam
Bread and butter, break beats to Bam Bam
Jump off the jim before I jack my Johnson
I jam like Janet, chew MC's like Swansons
Dennis stamp dummy, I'm diggin a dungeon
Can you dig that I dig deep, to destroy dumb-dumbs?
Yes, I yam what I yam when I jam, bro
My afro's in the house (yo yo yo)
Long as I live large, life will be luxury
Ladies in Lamborghinis, love is like luck to me
Nasty nigga, competition is none
From Newark, New Jersey, knock heads like Mike Nunn
Shit, grab the steel when I'm strokin'
Smoke with shotguns but the sign said no smokin'
Cool it kiddo, I control from sea to sea

Negro, funkin' it with the style in your ear, bro
To make you fear me like Cape without Robert DeNiro
You big pussy, so funky that you have to douche me
You can't hear me then my record label didn't push me
I know I'm sayin' 'funk' too many times in my rhymes
But if I wasn't that, I wouldn't freak it in the line
But it don't seems to matter 'cause my shit get fatter and fatter
I'll do the funk in your face and it slaps ya
How does it feel with the face full of funk
With the bass in your trunk, weed laced with the blunt
I puff, I never got snuffed, bust while I dust your monkey
Ass off then I just crush on the hush hush
So if you want a taste of the funk from the gutter
Ask the brothers (Why?) 'Cause I'm bad (Word to mother)

Yo kid chill, a'ight, a'ight, check it out

Flexy I'm sexy when I'm standin' in my drawers
If you can't check me when I'm rappin', put the tape on pause
And listen to the incredible shit that I kick my man
Give me five on the backhand then stick
Your finger in a hole and chop the stick quick
'Cause my lip get to the point, to STILL rock the fly shit
Since you're holding your breath, I hold my jewels
I swing hardcore, so I walk, holdin' my tools
The original P-Funk, takes no junk, from a chump, or punk, G
I been this way every since nine months
So get down while I rip the raps from my lip 'cause
My shit's more deep, than any tape from Enigma
The gettin' nice, thinkin' killer brother who pop trash
Basic instinct — I'm a shooter so they got blasted
Much ass I kick, groove to the master mix
My song still pumps when it's not even mastered, bitch!
My shit's very chronic so rewind it
'Cause it's like.. eh-eh-eh-eh beyond, bionic!
'Cause I'm a wild and crazy guy! No lie!
Last brother to battle me I started pissin' in his eye
I'm bad, word to mother, to the motherfuckin' Hubbard
Eatin' her curds and whey, puffin spliffs 'cause she doesn't
And if you still don't under-fuckin-stand where I'm comin' from
Listen to my nine, understand where it's hummin' from!

But for now I ""Get on up!"" rhythm and funk
Makes you hump like Technotronic I'll make the Jam Pump
Strong to the finish when I freak the fly gimmick like
""Du-na-da-du-duh!"" without eating my damn spinach
Cause when I'm on a roll, that's when Redman start
""To chill,"" round off backflip cartwheel
""Ah, you guessed it!"" I know
When my afro grow that mean more rhymes to flow
But I continue, on the menu, and send you
On a jam that earthquakes the whole damn venue
It's like this, it's like that, I won't slack
I pack more steel than the cops pack blackjacks
Word is bond, the quiet storm broke your arm
When I sound off from here all the way to Hong Kong
Drop pound for pound to throwdown and strut
Yo E what's that funk mode? ""Get on up!""

""I just want to jam for you""
""Ev-everybody get up!""
""I just want to jam for you""
""Get on up!""

Check this out here, let the rough cut cut your ear
Hit Squad's the crew I'm twenty-two and Beck's the beer
Float like Muhammad, roll-on like Secret
Me rip, the crowd in half on the sneak tip
Til they crumble, too humble for you to stumble
I sting like a bu-bee while the others bum-bumble
Don-dan-dan, do-do-dan-ding
Extremely wild, like the hair on Don King
Cause I kick the mode to make your brain explode
It's the HUH, the funk, now I'm known around the globe
So buckle up, hush up, while I freak the funk to get down
With the sound, grab my bozack then I freeze now
On your mark, get ready, get set, let's go
With the flow to jet like Delta, or Jesse O
Whiz with the bends I clean my front lens
With a system, that knocks harder than Rin-Tin-Tin
Without question, I'm flexy when I'm sexin
Wicked when I Kick It like A Tribe Called Quest-in
The rude Redman rip backbones and hips to bits
Then split ya from your wrist to your armpits
But true indeed, since pop's dropped the seed
I knew I'd be, the funkiest brother that ever bleeds
Rough and rugged, more nuggets in the bucket
That's dum dum dollars, and yes Redman love it
Pound for pound, I throw down to make ya strut
Yo E what's that funk mode? ""Get on up!""

""I just want to jam for you""
""Ev-everybody get up!""

Me havin' him scooped up, he woke up with his dukes up
That caused me to cut the hands off the man with the chainsaw
Plus I got his brain pickled in a jar
So let's get down with the funk break, cause they tailgate
My rap style, so to cut em off I truncate
And rough em up, tough em up, like bust em up

On the strength!
Party with Machine and Oprah Winfr'
First class tickets, hotel bitches puffin mad blunts
Blunts?
Blunts
Blunts don't don't rhyme with Oprah Winfr' troop
Who cares what rhymes with it long as the funk pump through my Benz truck
Now you know you don't own a Benz
Yes I do and chrome's the trim
Black with a system when it's hittin I'm pullin mad skins
With Olde E sittin in between my lap
And when brothers act up, a gun machine I pack
The original P-Funk, got the jewels trunk, a funker
When I'm sexin, my bad is bigger than any buster's
Like Max and
Wait wait wait, could we get on with the tape?
Lights, camera, hah, action
Welcome to Red's tape, may I take your order?
It's a slaughter if you order the hit without the water
And then swallow without the damn water to follow
You might be doin the stupid dance and win a grand at the Apollo
Whatchu know?
I'm rough, snap necks, drink Olde E, but crack Beck's
Wreck anything that's wet, when I have sex
For instance, I mix with, a style that make you shit bricks
Tsk tsk, I'm musically gifted, to rip it
Um-shat-lot, Red got crazy knots
And knots in the pots, got props from here to George Washington Bridge
I get biz, I use hats, so no kids
Fuck, I took out more suckers, than a
Hold up! I don't think I can freak the funk like that
I might have to nap, because my afro is like Shaft
Puffy, fade it quite lovely and to snuff me
Get your gang, cause I'm Fightin with more Power than Chuck D
Chuck D from Public Enemy?
Yeah he's a friend of me
The one that say ""Brothers and sisters?""
Yeah but he's no kin to me
I'm strictly negro, I freak the style and there it goes
Boom!
If a stitch in time saves nine, then I got shit sewed
Put pins in needles, and needles in pins
A happy man is a happy man, that, when I'm hittin skins
Fuck skins, I'm hittin puss when it's gush
Then eat it when the puss is well cooked
Look!
Up in the air?
No the cab
Who's in the cab? Whut Thee?

Redman,"When I come around homeboy watch yo nuggets

Chill and relax, I'm back in effect

I'm don't care, I'm still wild like tone loc
I'm swift, a.k.a. a black stallion
Fat herringbone, with no medallion
Hello, I still got the same funk flow and yo

When I rock I need all the girls with me
So I can be their baby tonight, like Whitney
Houston, producin' a style that make a smile
To make you say, ""ooh child!""

Hall of fame it hang it so no one can claim it
I rule from my style from the boondocks
Now my shit pumps in the boombox
Yo red, my ears are ringin'
Hey, Erick Sermon!

Plus you have the crotch to drive me crazy

Put down the microphone
Thank you, right about now I'm through
I'm ghost like Casper see you!

When I come around homeboy watch yo nuggets

Funky fresh in the flesh, the superman grand slams a new twist
Scoop this, Redman is milk like two tits
I stay, freshly dipped with the nine
And a clip on my hip, money grip, no bullshit
I tic-tac on small cracks I'm all that to fall black
My jaw snap with raps so umm, get the balls jack
Flavor like flav, plus I'm well paid
Own a maid with a plaid, mack daddy of the decade
At a slow rate, I sparkly like Colgate
My dick's name machete, I stab much ho-cake
I don't have a car, but own a pair of Reeboks
It gets me where I'm going, until my damn feet stops
On and on like a switch, bust the mix
Jam, oops! I turn up the pitch
To make me boom to zoom with the tune
To make the cow jump back over the moon
It's Reggie Noble, Yeah, I'm feelin' kinda so-so
I dog you like toto, make Rudolph nose glow
Funk out of site with the type of hype
To make you say umm, a dy-no-mite!
Chiller, chiller than the ice on vanilla
I kill more kills than the quills from tequila
I'm down with the green eyed brother named Erick
Charlie how you rate this? (hmm, jam like Bo Derek)
I'm deeper than a valley, peace to cool v and sally

Redman,"Whoo  hahh... ohhahh  wooooh 

Aww shit!! 



Hey dudes my interludes more fatter than most niggaz LP's 

So don't sell me to stale cheese 

I'm more nicer than Little Red Robin Hood's grandmama 

puffin on ganja  sippin on a  Cherry Bianca 

My grand finale's like an alley when it's rowdy 

kick more bars than the penile G 

And let my nine clap loudly 

Click click  bee yow  bang  booyaka!! 

What am I do to ya? It's somethin new to ya 

Like screwin ya, all over my studi-ah 

Ride on my MP-60 and let the S-950 squeeze your titties 

That quickly I hooked you, now fix me with your lips 

B...otch, unloosen my belt thinkin to grab the crotch 

But before you do move my glock before it shoot my cock 



And see basically them trick bitches get no dap (word) 

And see basically Redman album is no joke (word) 

And see basically I don't get caught up at my label (word) 

Cause I kill when they fuck with food on my dinner table (word) 



I drop a punchline at lunchtime 

cause I'm a Close Encounter of the None Kind 

with dumb rhymes 

I battle allay'all at one time 

So fuck all you fools out there with the large vocabulary 

in your sentence, I don't need that shit to pay my rent with, huh 

And to the nosey snake-ass hoes I ask you 

Why you be acting all fly 

when your monkey-ass work at fast food? 

And why is it everytime that a multiplatinum artist 

always use the underground to make a comeback? 

Is it fair to the hardcore niggaz that rap? 

That don't give a fuck about the radio 

plus the next bitch at that? 

And being hardcore and mad about wearing high-tech boots 

and black skelly hats? 

And making fake-ass frowns because your best buddy packs? 



Think about it 

Sip on a chocolate thai, and let your brain fall out of focus 

This is another episode, coming live from the Funkadelic man himself 

Yeah 

Ahhh 

Huh",Basically
Redman,"And I say right about now you are rockin' with the best!
Can I get a hit? Thank you 
What you're about to experience is a walk on the Funkadelic side
Who knows better than the Funkadelic devil himself
To all knotty head niggas, bob to this
Come walk with Def Squad on the darkside
Coming to you live and direct without further adieu
I bring to you Redman one more time
This is Jeff Stewart and you know how I do it god damn!

So who's that funky nigga that's known to kick the fat shit?
The mirror said ""You are, you conceited bastard""
Done by the dogcatcher, dogcatcher, it's the dogfetcher, I betcha
Ah, with the slang
Get you coughed up from the weed it'll bust your brain
The top notch of hip-hop and I'm on the charts
I'm catchin' applause when I rock the micraphone from the heart
My style's foul, so look into the eyes of Lorimars
As you can see, I drop funk bars from here to Mars
Still rollin' down the highway wit' my forty between my lap bitch
Crossin' DTW, coming into my lap and
Boy my skills are stacks, I love to do it from the back
My style swarms over ghettos like crack
Blow in any hood and puff a blunt with any nigga
As long as we both got, it don't matter who's gun bigger
But I bet you you can't do that, 'cause the multi-platinums
Can't save your ass on the block, and you're fucked if it ain't pop
The funk is blowin' wattage out your fuckin' trunks
Like peak Puma, I known to give a whole lots of lumps
Props I got, coming through your block nine cocked
My socks, even got three-eighty-nine shots
Don't press it, I hang 'em like them niggas do in Texas
You don't have no heart you chestless, 'cause your heart's on my necklace
I give props to real MC's like KRS-One
Kool G Rap, Buckshot, Busta me and I'm from
The East coast! Where a nigga like you get that fat?
And since you came out gassed, well I'm closin your gas cap
The creature, from the deeper, ultimate funk freaker
Represent New Jersey, keep your eyes up on the bleacher
A menace like Dennis, I got game like Ennis
I can french-kiss my lyrics, then I run trains with sentence
Lord have mercy! It's too much funk to cope with
Droppin' dope shit after dope shit, we're atrocious
That's from the lungs, that rings from here to kingdom come
And I don't have to be a Special Ed to get dumb!",Bobyahed2dis
Redman,"I'm like row row like I have cerebral palsy 
My flows be's wet like all you girls drawers be 
Crack the dill's spread the Buddha in the hid-ouse 
Roll it up and Diddas, who tipped in for the 10 bag 
Etcetera, I roll my blunts with two textures 
Pick up 50 bags and then I smoke all the extras 
It's the truth like funk 180 proof 
Don't drop your drawers I'll fuck through your daisy dukes, true 
Put your fingers up in the air if your high 
I walk by, so f-in' dry 
I swing up in it 'bout an average as half as 
Good as Reggie Jackson's that's why you talk backwards 
And touch bills and Bogart shit like Humphrey 
You couldn't beat me if you ran with 21 Jumpstreet 
Or 90210 fuck it yo, in the movies
I'm the Nigga puffin' Buddha in the back row 

[Chorus:]
I can't wait to get it on [Repeat 8x]

I'm just a smoky boy, I'm from the land of the lost 
You can't see me like Charlie Angel's boss 
I'm often coolin' round the Bliddocks 
I rock round the Cliddock 
My Gliddock cocked from here to 16 for Liddocks 
I tried to Thomas if I'm gettin' scopic 
I was built like two tits but now I'm butter like Blue Bonnet 
Now who got the funk, we got the funk 
A yo well, I got the weed, we got the blunt 
I never sniff, I used to puff Buddha's in the jail 
Back in 88 when it was 20 cent a gram 
You couldn't read me in braille, hell 
I write my names on walls in smoke spots when I'm buyin' L 
The fly guy with force like Luke sky 
Down for 8 ball see twa bitch if you fly 
The funkadelic been rockin' mic's since the fourth grade 
I terminate like X and I terminate like Schwarzenegge' 
Dum di dum, rock like Buju Banton 
Soup like won ton, fuck by the ton 
Please, my whole crew's makin' cheese 
Tonight's the night baby so suck up on these 
And it's on 

[Chorus]

I said, I catch the A-train to the left, smoke the junk 
I set shit off like Boba Fett. 
Big up to all my Nigga's in the housing projects 
I'm Runnin' up in your contingents and split your guts, round and round 
If you get scared of my lines when I rock well 
Got wits like Pernell, shits the bomb like Akinyele
Rickety rock it, mind be best to knock this 
Waste Nigga's like toxic, wet like galoshes 
Can I handle my biz? Yes you can 
I 'cause chaos and bring a lot of def to jams 
Yes I can, now ask to get out 
Pop the trunk, clu-clunk and now give me a ba-bump ba-bump 
Oh, cool, smooth like two blue suede shoes 
Y'all faggot's stepped on my Huffman and Coo's 
Word to Dan, tan, pillow and cool be	 
Switchin' speeds like Bruce Lee ridin' a Fuji in a movie 
I drop on the one, fuck the two three 
Funky like a box of Coochies on looseleaf 

Yo yo I said 
Switchin' up speeds, like Bruce Lee 
Ridin a Fuji, in a movie 
I've been sayin' some shit
Now, if you didn't get it 
Laugh now...  And figure that shit out when you get home",Can't Wait
Redman,"Yeah, bout to fly that knot
Redman, Keith Murray, Erick Sermon with the, cosmic slop
And we all pack glocks
Word is bond, word is bond
Fuck around and get shot

As I flip, skip to the beat, on wax, and tax
I react with tons of macs, a ball, and some jumping jacks
Flyin expert, puttin in work
No question, cosmic funk and weed session
Like Gangstarr, step up, it's hard to earn
But I change up the mode, and blow up the globe
The bandit, spittin dialect umm (ummm)
Catchin wreck umm (ummm)
One two micraphone check (ummm)

        to hell and beyond
Funkadelic drop the bomb!!

Boo-yaa!
I'm that type of nigga to give it to ya
My cosmic slop rules all blocks with funk maneuvers
My flow freeze the Nile, the funk child splits the river
Then I crush, like the bom-ba-zee was rushed, through my verbal lust
I'm spaced out, I lost my mind on cloud nineteen
Visine for eyes, when I blow alpines
Dial 9, 0-0, for the hero of the weirdos
I hope my brain don't bust
Transform into a 7-11 Slurpie slush
It's the fly, my music will burn eyes
Twice the chemical of Clorox
Then I do an autopse on four cops
When my jaws drop, ock, I fidget my nuts a lot
Got the two glocks, with oowops then bodies trace the chalk
I'm like an eclipse on a Friday, the 13th
With black cats and Haley's comet, blazin blunts in my driveway
Nostradamus predicted, for you funk fiends
That def squad will get the fuckin cream like noxem...geyeah

        for those that remember pics and afros (it's on like that)
        platform shoes and bell-bottoms some got em
        spaced out, way out, is what I'm talkin about
        in the cosmic slop of the ghetto
Zuzuzuzuzu, zuzuzu, zuzu zuzu zuzu
Zu zuzu, zuzu zuzu zuzu zuzu zuzu zuzu

With amazing manifestations, I dictate to nations
More cosmic funk innovations in my creation
This cosmic sick mic cylcicyst
Mega segments, be sega, like genesis
I orbits the solar system, listenin
Guzzlin, never sippin, or slippin and sympin when the track is rippin
I gotcha brain cells bendin and twistin
Man listen, I give your whole crew a ass drenchin
Just for mentionin, goin that route, runnin yo mouth
You get your head smacked off towards down south
And your crew too will be spaced out
Way out, no doubt, y'all niggaz need to stop
And get with this cosmic slop

Can I, drop the funk on ya, run it on ya 
Strong as ammonia, smell it from here to California 
Cause Reggie Noble dropped that cock named Noble at Sunoco 
I'm better than rice and beans when I rock you ocho to ocho

Convertible, fuel-injected, that's why my style's well-respected 
I'm dope on the ridealz, so fidealz, on my didealz 
And chumps are wondering what two niggaz dropped the funk funk 

Verbally you never heard of me I smoke you third degrees 
And cause surgery for emergency 
Cause Reggie Noble's known like burglary 
I get hot busted when I dip my nuggets 
Hey, if it take a million niggaz to stop it just like Chuck did 
Cause we run around Newark with the nine cock 
Keep it heated for the brothers that's not off my block 
And if ya don't know the flavor, be a tough guy and enter 
So go show you more nigga events than Jacob Jaffrey center 
I'm genuine, to the rhyme, get your canines 
Cops that got the hot glock stocked for when it's playtime 
I rock around the Robin TWEET TWEET on the calendar 
Cause you couldn't pull my number if your class major was Algebra 
I make bitches moan to my Stallone without Sylvester 
Cause I'm more deadlier than a whole school system of investors 
So check us, I always smoke mad blunts before breakfast 
Cause I, Get Around like 2Pac with Poetic in my Justic

And if you keep on with that dirty mistreatin 
I'm gonna whoop your ass, til your heart stop beating 

And yo, chronic bubonic the funky bionic 
You find it I'll have to rewind it where minds are blinded 
Time for some action so time to find it 
I smoked out like a cookout, look out my dick's out 
That was last album when I was bouncin on trains like Malcolm 
I was hiiiiigh, I thought I wouldn't survive 
That's why I quit my nine to five and got live 
Because this hip-to-the-hop shit fills my pockets

We're From the DarkSide radio 
Niggaz  better get your flashlights 
'Cause it's pitchblack! 

I travel the Milky Ways  and the stars of the Gods 
Then return six billion feet beneath to get cigars 
My lyrical format sounds off like gun claps 
Underground, where you need flashlights and hard hats 
My mind is ten levels deeper than Jacob's Ladder 
Batter the paragraph, after your gall bladder will shatter 
Nyphomaniac on track when I Flex like Funkmaster 
Flex you can bet I'm not playing with a full deck! 
I go far beyond acting hard and pullin' triggers 
I just want to die and come back as the Nile on the river 
Zone until I figured, how to wake up in the morning 
And the corners of my mouth be like foamin' when I'm open 
Y'all neighborhood roughnecks, I cause a threat 
My silhouette, who pack smacks niggaz just like Treach 
Comin' through comin' through, put your hands on your handfun

All aboard motherfuckers! While your brains get jacked 
I'm souped like two scoops of funk juice  word to mother 
The way I kick you swear that Jim Kelly was in this motherfucker 
The darkside brings apartheid 
I act wild like them niggaz from Chi-Town on the Southside 
Sweeter than this, whoopin' niggaz down like Jack Nich 
When I backflip my tactic graphics 
Ooooooh! Redman jams it in 
Due to difficulties I won't be done by ten

I keep the Buddha to last me through the week y'all 

Come take a trip on my cosmic movie boogie flicks 
Far beyond space so niggaz say your grace 
It's a True Lie that I bring drama like Schwarzenegger 
When a baby, I had other babies in labor catchin' vapors 
With two gats I move like too fast like Paxton 
Ask Toni Braxton who got seven days of action 
Black stars or moons eclipse the volume 
Bang zoom I'm sendin' honies on the moon with ten bags of boom 
Ridiculously I will pimp an MC 
To degrees I leave spots like chicken pox, check the synopsis 
I grow confusing just like Rubik's cube boxes 
Float like the butter, fly so what if I 
Blow your lenses, tear the fuckin' hinges 
Did I mention that my lyrical format gets more ahs than a dentist 
When I'm in this, the knotty-headed era causes terror 
Y'all gimmick motherfuckers better get y'all shit together

So nigga how you roll a blunt? Aiyyo  how you roll a blunt 
Flip the script on some other shit like how you roll a cunt 
Now, I smoke the Maui, wow-wee 
Then I'll be back for me, I'm Sure, like Al B. 
Go Uptown, smoke quarter-pounds at the Dungeon 
Keith Murray meets me at the spot with the Bom-Ba 
Go back to Jerz and smoke with Diezel Don 
Huh, pick up a bag from my block, two-oh's the number 
Who can get swift with the microphone mist 
Plus I'm crisp like CD's on LP's in 3D 
My funk respect it, cosmic injected 
That cause me to Set It Off just like that club record 
Hit it from the back, stay strapped like two packs of lubricants 
It's gonna hurt, no it's not a gat experience 
The funk dweller, creeps through your cellar 
And if your moms don't know your ass better tell her, like this y'all 

There's a million and one blunt spots all over the world 
That got good herb for all you boys and girls 
Which one do you go to? *many shouts* 
Which one do you go to? *many shouts* 
I'm packin buddha by the pounds and pull my Phillies from knapsacks 
Hey yo I didn't know your nickel bags come that fat 
Yo check it, my lyrics strip the track butt-naked 
Catch the Local to the A to the buddha to my vocals 
And I, set the world on fire 
Get a billion people higher, from just one blunt in my cypher 
You swore to God you was mixed in bom-ba-zee 
The rhymer Bombs Squads and MC's like Hank Shocklee 
I spend a knot at all the buddha spots 
From fifteen to fifty-fifth I ran all through the blocks 
I set it off jock, I light a blunt for my nigga D 
That's doin three pack, now where I get the hash at 
You can't fuck with my funk cause my funk is kinda abstract 
Past that, I'm rough like McGruff on dust 
There's a million and one blunt spots in America 
Yeah I'm tellin ya 

Now just throw your blunts up in the motherfuckin air 
Smoked out with niggaz from North Newark to Montclair 
I rip the nouns from antonyms to synonyms 
'Cause I got soul like James Brown and rock M&M 
One of the America's Most Blunted 
Smoked out with MC Eiht and Compton Most Wanted 
Ninety degrees, smoke with L.O.D. on the Island 
Then back to Stat, to smoke more packs with the Shaolin 
I showed the women how to roll a blunt stronger 
But it didn't work, because they Lee nails got longer 
But the weed is good for when you're mackin 
And girls can front it off like they don't know shit that happened 
I know what happened, I told her, BACK, NICK that motherfucker 
So check! 
My stamina, your ass couldn't snap with cameras 
Leave you on your back like Godzill did Gamera 
Props on blocks smokin the choc and what-nots 
I might catch a nickel bag sale from bus stops",A Million and 1 Buddah Spots
Redman,"Y'all motherfuckers buckle y'all motherfuckin' seatbelts 
If you need to get high  there's a mask and shit in the overhead compartment 
I can't tell y'all what the weather's like 'cause my radio's fucked up 
And if we should experience any type of motor difficulty 
Don't panic  take one more hit off the oxygen mask 
Calmly put your hands between your legs 
And kiss your black ass goodbye!! 

I'm swift like a motherfuckin' gift for Christmas 
When I send my vapors off like Halls menthalyptus 
My verbs and nouns shatter walls of underground 
Let me be blunt: I like crackin' brews with bitches 
The ninety-four era I cause terror, whatever 
Rainin on you punks with the funk, so get your umbrellas 
My guns cruise, tennis shoes, what's happenin' 
I got clapped on, now I'm the one doin' the clappin' 
I'm Flexi Wit Da Tec like Artifacts make Memorex 
Blow tape decks when I'm more strapped than latex 
Felt like menopause, I make niggaz act like beatches 
Yo yo that nigga Red be frontin with they ass full of stitches 
Woo! I just don't give a fuck 
I bite your whole nipple off, sick like sickle-cell anemia 
Travel around my curse universe 
I'm droppin' 98.7 degrees down to Red Alert 
Droppin' the slang, I'll bust your brains with the real shit 
Come hit my blunt so I can make y'all feel it 
Abuse niggaz verbally so call Dyfus 
I'm a warrior, to the heart, but I didn't kill Cyrus 
Noorotic, my style format rocks the project 
I get as ill as chief of police on narcotic 
Give me a time and I'll free your mind and lick your 
Funky emotions, to blow your veins up with funk overdosing 
Now who's that nigga that got your crew bellin'? 
Not with guns with funk when I rock tracks like Van Halen 

I'm in the world, with Jacob's Ladder 
I'm seein' a lot of happy copycat rappers actin like they got asthma 
They attackin' me, they slowin' they rhymes down actually 
They got factories with little dolls named after me 
But it's no question my funk segment leave the whole atmosphere 
Pressed-in, I take advantage of niggaz like I was molesterin' 
Newark New Jersey's what I represent 

My brain be zoned and I phoned home to ET's home 
And to hook me up with stash spots to put my chrome in 
Whattup to Prince Street, Avon Ave I roll a spliff with 
Fat to be passed through Bedrock and Diamond District 
So what the fuck I got clapped on for my truck 
Then I laughed cause fuck the cash I just wanted my tape bag 
Fantastic fabulous my shit is fat shit 
The bomb like Elway throw bombs on John Madden 
Fuck that, let's get to the point, my shit's the joint, I roast 
Motherfuckers from the East coast to the West coast to your breakfast 
Voltage, I got funk for days by the buckets 
PPP packs a bunch of wild motherfuckers 
Hold hold hold, wait wait wait 
Let me school this bitch 
Yo bitch my shit is tight, can any MC do this 
And come back on the mic? 

I think not, my paper make pen leave nuff ink spots 
On blocks where your punk ass still bustin' off slingshots 
Talkin' shit about me when I'm drivin by slowly 
Sayin' I'm this and that when half y'all punks don't even know me 
Now just for that I let your girl suck my dick from the back 
And let your moms give me cornrows on my crack 
'Cause I'm nasty like that",Noorotic
Redman,"Sat down and opened my mind and said it's time 
For me to design the right lines 
Make you one of a kind boy rough and 
Tough and all that stuff 
Sure enough I'll make the brother's change their minds 
Then you understand my only principle 
No need to fuck with the born invincible 

I'm rated X like a porno feature 
Leaving MC's dazed and catching an anesthesia's 
Even females get rocked when they try to cock 
Block the man from doing this hip hop
Techniques unique and that's my word is bond 
Rockafella's the name but the screaming I'll rock on",Rockafella (R.I.P.)
Redman,"Yo  this blunt is for all the niggaz that was in the 
Holding pen with me in central booking 
Welcome to the system

Spock, got the glock, now I'm smoking out your sess spot 
I rock from here to Bedstuy, I hit the spot like XY 
Who is that nigga that's coming six billion feet 
I roll my funk and find tone even smoke up blues with 18th Street 
I cut massively with sneaky styles like Dick Dastardly 
Look at the letter-coated afro like my man Shaft would be 
The new vroom, crisp like chicken and Chinese food 
I'm just like The Whispers here to put you in the mood 
[Jumping Jersey] Yeah you heard me, got more family than the Partridge 
Roll the red carpet for Red from here to corner markey 
You're trying me, I'm a menace of society, right

Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on [somebody, help 
Me!] Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on

My momma used to tell me turn that shit the fuck off 
So I had to play like Foxy and get off [get off] 
My shit was thick I bought a clip then cocked my own grip at honeydips 
'Cause moms made enough loot just to pay the bills with, beeitch 
Selling bags from uptown 
Me and Lester put our money together now we got the block locked down 
31 to local A-Train's, Hoboken 
I took the back way, New Jersey transit cops were open 
I'm hoping, that they don't go inside my boots 
'Cause we had everything, from jewelry to Thai-one suits 
And client el, I'm drinking Ballentine L in hell 
So Redman rock well before our record sell 
Then my moms crib was jacked by the jealous 
[And if ya ain't come back] Is what the base-head used to tell us 
[Yo fellas!] Our whole scheme sinking like boats 
'Cause Les mixed biz with pleasure when we should of stuck to lactose 
But every good thing comes to a end 
With no ends, on the block, selling weed again 
My moms tried to make me go to school, I just didn't listen 
Got locked up, now I'm all in the system, listen 
 
Whats up! I tickle your putty-cars with my loonie raps 
On groovy tracks, I make new jacks catch convulsions like groupie acts 
From my city I spread it all like Jiffy 
It's a mystery, my spliff be live like 145th be 
I mold like clay, and roll dice just like Andrew 
I stay strapped just like bamboo, my crews got mad handle 
Whatever, the weather be, I got mental telepathy 
So throw your bombest rapper and watch me intercept emcees 
I keep my car underground just like the Lords 
Even though I'm known, like all the four wheels on the course 
So let me pull up to your bumper like Grace Jones

Redman,"Hyah! Attention to all you punk motherfuckers out there 
(Uh huh uh huh  check it out  check it out) 
Funky Noble Productions represent for the nine four and nine five area 
Reggie Noble and Rockwilder in the house for the nizzow 
If you don't know you might as well close your biz out 
(To my peeps in Queens) 
Yeah  oh shit  yo  it's a bird 
(Nah I thought that shit was a fuckin plane dude) 
Nah nah nah, it's Soop, Soop, Soop-a-man

Hah 

Well it's the Soopaman Lovah in your motherfuckin town

Honeydip, now all of y'all up in that funny shit 
But I ain't switched, still a honeydip is a honeybitch 
in the mix! So bitches be lookin fly and I'll run in em 
With they toes and nails done, hair wrapped up with pins in em 
Fifty-four eleven Reebox bitch which you need not 
to do is get fly, cause where I'm from, bitches get speed knots 
Slow your monkey ass down and hold your horses 
Don't want to know your name don't want to know none of your sources 
Just fix me, with a quickie, I swear more Lake's than Ricki 
So bad I use my X-Ray vision to give y'all clits a hickie 
And plus the weed I puff is from the planet of Cheech and Chong 
Where the earth is chronic, and How To Roll a Blunt is the theme song 
Oh you makin me horny! Well uhh, let me wipe that wetness for ya 
Slurped and burped, got that bitch more open than my door do 
Let's take a journey up in the stars where I live at 
Where I fuck Jane, Judy Jetson, and that robot bitch-ah 
Grab onto the cape and uhh... I said before I took her 
don't choke me! And it's up up and away I took the hooker 
And it's on 

We landed on my planet, we smoked out like a fuck up 
Bought a dime from Jabba the Hut and some uncut for the hooker 
She said, ""I don't sniff blow I just smoke weed to get me horny. 
So I'm nothin like that bitch in your last Soopaman Lovah story."" 
You go girl! But I didn't believe her, had to make sure 
Where you from, the projects? ""Yeahhhh, but I'm single. 
You needed a quickie and I'm just that bitch to break you off, shit 
my pussy's so good, it tickle my legs when I walk!"" 
Oh really, just show me a couple of ways how you'll thrill me 
She lifted up her dress and the whole area got chilly 
""So what you think of that?"" I threw that bitch back on my back 
Shit I live ten miles away, but I made it fo' seconds flat 
I lived in the same building with Mr. Spock and Captain Kirk 
Got R2D2 and Mork from Ork puttin in work 
See I got the block sewn ""Oooh baby let's get it on!"" 
About time, I opened the door she had her ass and tits showin 
She rushed me to the room and stripped me out of my attire 
She tied me to the bedposts then she lit the room on fire 
She took out a scarf wrapped it around my eyes till I was blind 
But with my X-Ray vision I saw the icepick from behind 
So I broke out the ropes, smacked the hoe, then suplexed her 
She pulled out a Tec and wet my chest with the S1's 
""Oh shit I'm shot!"" There was blood all over my finger! 
I think I left my other bulletproof suit in the cleaner 
She gave a whistle, they came in crews, word is bond 
It was a bunch of Martian bitches with bodysuits and Platforms 
""Damn, I gotta think of a plan, whatamIdo? 
Did Superman have a gun?"" Nah, but the Soopaman Lovah do! 
So I pulled out the fo'-fifth, left the bitches open 
Had another clip in case some mo' bitches want mo' shit 
And I saw that trick Bewitched flying on her broomstick 
Pa-dow! Shot her down because I leave no witness 
Job well done I cleaned myself in a hurry 
Oops! Gotta catch this blunt session

But the funk just don't stop
As we take y'all fat roly-poly asses on another journey
To the darkside...

Verse One:

Wuditlooklike? When I wipe off my sweat
Verbally I'm Untouchable like Elliot Ness
To the best of my ability I rock any facility
And fuck the yellow cabs I smoke buddha out deliveries
I'm just as high as the fuckin friendly skies
When I'm, open, you can't even see my chinky eyes
Cause the buddha I smoke, is no joke, when I'm loc'ed
Then I wet it, then you be like -- that shit be soaked!!
I'm saggin my.... Karl Kani...
and Two Black Guys when I get busy like the L.I.
Well I, swing it back and forth like a leaf
Without traffic I flow like the B.Q.E.
But I can pass niggaz straight out of first-class
Then leave em huffin and puffin like first day at Lemans class
PPP, got the glocks and techs
And Def Squad always got some fly shit on deck

Chorus: repeat 4X

I said wuditlooklike (wuditlooklike)

Verse Two:

A-hem... 
The Funk Doctor Spock blow the watt through your box
I come hotter than Treach, you bet about callin the cops
Because (this type of funk you don't hear on the regular)
Rock six seven eight nine ten (to eleven ta)
Knew my style got more powers than Cocoon
Zoom your focus, I drop the mic and leave it smokin
When I'm vexed, my concepts Wreck like Effect
Verbal communications blow to the next ep
I'm robbin your brains with antilogical, phenomical
Suicidal with lethal type funk spread your nodules
Straight up the weight up plus I max like a Beta
Boy I fuck your head up like a blunt that's laced up
The boogie verbalist, vocalist
I get open with, puttin scannings on the fake soloist
My style reachin down like Ike, switch up like dykes and
You'll be tellin your psychologist wuditlooklike

Verse Three:

Wuditlooklike suckers, punk motherfuckers
Bitches be actin funny, don't wanna show me no love cuz
They think I'm crazy and like mentally sick
Ahhh, give em the dick then they quiver like fish, then I
Smoke a pound of herb a day, and yo
Some bitches say, I'm the Mack like Maceo
I don't be that I just beez the funk disease
that leave MC's, recognizing like Sam Sneed
The funkindominal, I bring drama to any rendezvous
Rock three-sixty-five, twenty-four, Monday through
That other shit, makes them other ship, flip
funk ridiculous, inconspicous with lyrics
A-uhhm, oh-seven-one-oh-three's where I from
Been gettin dumb, every since Harlem World used to jump
And that's for all them hardrock niggaz that's comin in flocks
I bust off the glock for the hood and the block

Chorus ",Wuditlookllike
Redman,"East Coast, West Coast
All my country, funky, brother, motherfuckers

To my, no good niggas, and my, no good bitches
Sorry if I left somebody leavin out with stitches
Seems y'all too bold for ya britches
Enslaved your mind like cotton pickers for runnin wit some rotten niggas
I get raw to the core with hardcore metaphors
Resevoir Dog style, truly yours
Yes, I be the slug up in your chest
Then you wonder why you can't feel the full strength of cigarettes
My nationality is, brutality
I got the gun up under your leather nigga so walk casually
You'd be surprised how much info you can get
For a bottle of crack to find yo' punk ass and yo' kinfolks
Plus, that crew you run with is butt
I was dusted one day when I made your man choke up
Rappers comin to New Jersey and be gettin fucked up
Talkin about where they from and shit when dem sons ain't runnin shit
And GOD FORBID! you do a show in da Bricks
You'd swear you was fly and how we bring so much turbulence
I keep your nervous level high nigga
You better kiss your son and daughter, tell em bye nigga
When we creep

I give respect to all my woolly niggas with the Rolex
Shinin briquettes, flashin cash and dumpin Moets
Especially when my royalty check is late, I don't hesitate
I scoop up Keith, and see who's flashin at the Palla-
-dium, hide your weed niggas cause here I come
Lookin bummy for low profile, so loud MC's overlook me
I slip the bartender some raw
Just to tell me [how much cash and Dom P you pour]
Huh, I should start robbin rappers in the industry
If we ain't clickin then I'm engineerin your injuries
Forty-eight tracks of automatic semtax
Lyrically splat-datted till your mentality blacks
And I don't give a FUCK if you did thirty bids
Still I bring Ecstasy like I'm the rapper Jalil
Blaow blaow blaow, lickin shots for your fuckin
Mind, I got you niggas duckin out like I'm one-time
Or five-oh, po-po, I drive hoes nutty
Like I be doin security at my live shows
Your A&R is a punk, he got you gassed
When I brutally smash any contender in my weight class
Aiyyo Twinz yo this nigga got jewels

When we creep",Creepin'
Redman,"Original rude bwoy on your scene
Haha  ha ha ha!
Everybody light your blunts get your smoke on

Just roll that weed (roll that weed) just roll that weed (roll that weed)

Ayo yes it's me the MC Grand Royal
Spittin' that Newcleus I suggest you Jams On It
I'm not a role model I cracks the Beck's bottle
Smoke blunts, play pretty MC's as sex models
So inhale, exhale, what you smell?
Derail the frail blind MC off my trail
If he use braille, see I never been touched
Regulate the street tactics then parlay in the cut
Uhahh, lay back and hit this while I shit this
Flip this, get some ass flow at long distance
And plus I pack nine inches in my britches
And keep an instant lit for the funky ass bitches
Newark, New Jersey's on the map, comprende?
And confrontations start from the blunts and the Reme
And if any, MC out there want to test
Call my boy Poppa see to put a slug in your vest

Ow, shit I'm just one hip nigga
Shit is off the hook when my crew is in the mixture
What I deliver, over tracks and rivers
Is making your lungs collapse and quiver, it's the
PPP foundation in your ass
We be the bomb like that Oklahoma blast
Then outlast, a few clowns, sounds
Raps, stay bein' the mack like Dru Down
Ask me what I smoke and I say, ""It's the method!""
Funk off the hook I leave shit disconnected!
What's the name of that town rollin' up trees?
(Jersey smokin' up the bom ba zee!)
It don't stop, you better move slowly
I make that chest wet and cozy
Then dip low-key like OG's
Then inject that antidote to make you OD
You know a better flower get the dough G and show me
I bet you I make em more pussy than Jonsy (meow*)
And show em How High I am just from the nosebleed (How High)
I keep it Naughty By Nature
Kick that rugged shit that Maybelline could make-up, lace up

Smoke lalala (smoke lalala)

Funk Doctor, got your ass locked down proper
Let me next blast derelicts, Binaca
I'ma Star at War, smoke blunts, don't Chewbacca
The head banger boogie for the marijuana shoppers
Lace the tracks with stacks of artifacts
Make the police arrest me for givin' the cardiac
'Cause I'm the shitter, headbanger non-quitter
Twenty blunt a day nigga, Land-cruise whipper
I represent, commence to beat an instrument
Who's next to get that ass bent ten percent
I make you boo pass off your jewels you lose 'cause

React opponent, I Got Five On It
Met some hoochie, now I got fifty-five on it
With two Coronas, I dominate my opponents

Fuck such and such, I roll tight like handcuffs
Rock that ass to sleep with discrete techniques
I beez that, freak of the week like I made Knee Deep
Hold up! Rotate around the solar, badder than Cobra
Composure never sleeps, my stream pumps Folgers
I'm sauteein MC's with fried rice up in the wok
Without the MSG and chopped celery
See, I made it, my flavor situated
From the nickel plated mic that's hot, to leave your brain inflated
Plus, I'm thick like Quakers on papers
Bodacious MC's get turned to lower cases
Lettering, and the medicine, that I'm swallowin
Get you hollerin, like Marvin Gaye when his father shot him
In the chest, I roll with two stacks of Tecs
And mad niggas in sets that'll roll up in your rest
UHH! Mister Fantastic's crafted off that 50 sack of ass kick
When I'm blasted, my mathematics get drastic
That you can't see with bifocals
Watchin MC's go up and down like stock brokers
I leave your brains on tilt, with ill skills that's milk
That's rougher than jeans that Gloria Vanderbilt
I'm poppin mad shit, plus I can back it
Your man'll be like ""Yo, get that dust off yo' jacket""

It ain't a test or quiz that my Squad can win
Those who know the biz, know we wreck kids, get biz
You'll digest, multiple stab wounds to the chest
Then I copycat, kill the rest
With no method to my madness
Bless the apparatus with the baddest
Determined to be the last man, standin on the planet
You'll get attached, like a blood suckin' leech
When you fall into my rhythm of speech
Your ears get embraced with a touch of the bass
Head get wrapped up, neck get thrown in a neck brace
Rough rhyme mechanical, lyrical at it who?
Will ironically chronically murder you and your crew
My directive, through where I live, is kinda primitive
See I get to the bottom of the problem, and make shit give
Step in the jam, hooded and high, plastered the master
Cast to the masses grabs the mic
Ten dollar rappers is what L.O.D. goes after (Tweek, Tweek)
To my Squad, there's no matches, we bashes
Do photo flashes in all flavor S-classes

I'm more wetter than your boy bigger
So how you figure you can fuck with this rap unemployed nigga
I should own a fly bitch house and a Benz
But I got chickenheads criminals and broke friends
That love to get ends, keep the seventeens spinnin'

Def Squad, Erick Sermon, Redman keep keep it on
K to M Keith Murray keep keep it on
Keep keep on, ya don't stop
Keep keep it on, and ya don't stop
Keep keep it on, and ya don't stop
K-Solo, Redman, ya don't stop
Erick Sermon, Keith Murray ya don't stop

I X'd ya amateur, damage ya, have fools jumpin off
Cliffs grabbin their ass cheeks yellin Geronimo
It ain't a problem at all when K solve
Three-hundred and sixty degrees rhymes or boulevards
Are charged, by my entourage, who put the Ram in Dodge
Bas cla in bumba claat
Maintain, few remain in the game
So I remain focused and pop's the main aim

Well it's the Funk Doctor Spock, the pon cock lyricist
My mentality's so def yo I ain't even hearin this shit
Biscuits be cockin back when I be coming
I guess they heard how I be takin MC's out by the hundreds
Wanted, for two million and a body alone
And use the microphone as my accomplice
Scientist still trippin, thinkin
What the fuck is this funky fungus that growed amongst us

Sprayed a few, shank a few, rap crews say they shamed too
But can't hang two, like we do
Fuck them, they better bow slow
This rhyme'll cold hit em, real quick cause I'm K-Solo
Battle any dude, this retifuge I'm in cruise
See what the better vet, could do, to you undouche
You three groups, four punkses at a time
I box two and knock em out at the drop of a dime

The long faced murderer
Servin over two billion motherfuckers a day like Mickey D's circular
Workin a shifty hour like a burgular
My crew herbin ya like we never even heard of ya
Odds are evens, that I'mma be the one creepin
My new niggas check the flows of the major deacon
The bazaar, the rap non-superstar
When I step up I pump volume like rah

My afro blows in three-hundred sixty degrees
So this makes me, the light skinned Richard Roundtree
Vocabularies very, loquacious
And gregarious, pump that too, go grab the dictionary
Fly word that we flip on the M-I-K-E mike
My crew be like, this style's hype
Wrong's the opposite forget the bullshhhh
To rhyme like the K-Solo, you need more than a soul kid

Come closer, while I lock it down like I'm supposed ta
You battle me, you won? You might of, but then you woke up
My turbulence will make peanut butter choke up
Call me tha Brick City, Stock Cock Broker
Y'all niggas is fools, playin with hood moves
You couldn't total my amount if you sung I Missed You
Dissed you dismissed you yeah I fixed you
Let your girl suck on the shit that I piss through",It's Like That (My Big Brother)
Redman,"Somebody light the fuse so I can bring bad news
To all these crews who can't NBA Jam with the shoes
That double shot Hennessy got my mind trippin'
Drunk enough to start a campaign on ass kickin'
With my nigga Keith who give assists like Scott Pippen
For MC derelict whippin, cap or cock twistin
Drop your money in the slot if your block don't got
A real representer cocked for action like my block got
Rhyme skills three and a quarter for them drop tops
Your caliber, straight up pussy who pop Glocks
While I kick facts react on funky tracks
Give me room like the Hyatt while I run this jungle habitat
And if I snap get that monkey off my back
Me and mic's together roll tighter than Slick and Vance Wright
Toast to the real MCs that can feel me
And if your bitch ain't jumpin now then later on she will be
All these weak punk MC's kill me
They don't thrill me, come to Jerz and get Jacked like Jill G

Hoo, ha (""Iz he for real he can't be"")",Iz He 4 Real
Redman,"Hahha
Now everytime I grab the mic I always start shit up
Sharper than your double-edger, watch me carve shit up
Live and direct, respect it to the underground connect
Pah!! I'm wreckin any MC you select
Yo E, load me in your gun, light the flares
Give me forty-eight bars, and I go out like gays at Billy Bear
Wear and tear, I'm wreckin for the Bricks I swear
Jump in my way and get your body splattered everywhere
Conjunction junction what's your function
It's that nigga who's so swift I could lose a compass
Step into jams, with seven niggas in a Land
And forty motherfuckers in some fucked up caravan
Drop the Fahrenheit back down to zero
Bring Heat to the streets like Al Pacino and DeNiro
Raw dog material, grand imperial
Talk to my shotty nigga, my ears ain't hearin' you

(We on fire tonight, and the place is lookin' steamy)
(As we proceed)
(We on fire tonight, and the place is lookin' steamy)
So take heed to what I'm saying
Cause tonight's the night, and me and my nukkas ain't playing
(We on fire tonight, and the place is lookin' steamy)
(As we proceed)
(I'm on fire)
Rockin' on, Redman rockin' on

Now do I look crazy? Deranged, maybe?
You shot first, your Glock burst, but it graze me
Now time for lyrics, put up your guns
And watch me get this shit hoppin like the West was won
Got that lyrical chicken feed, for all chicken heads
Crowd your Rap City committee like I'm Big Lez
More sicker than them Menendez brothers
You need Cochran when you're fuckin with Judge Dredd
Put your fingers up if you love hash and cash
I been that way since Ike Turner was kickin Tina ass
Hookers ridin dick, like I'm a motorcycle
You wanna shine bitch? Let me Simoniz you
I make sure your vision blur, till you don't know what occurred
Until I black out every nerve
Foul women get served as chicken head hors d'ouerves
I drop your tops like your heads was convertibles!!
Hah, if you still look up in the sky I'm still high
All the way live like Lakeside
Wann die? E (whattup son), you got this beat bumpin'
The way I feel niggas ain't leave until they up in somethin'
Pack my dutch like the niggas in the county
Dayrooms, stay tuned, for Doc Illuminati
Up around them big butt freaks is where you find me
(Martini and Rossi, Asti Spumante)

Rockin' on, Redman rockin' on

To my people in the back, if you're not the wack, say
Don't stop, the body rock
To my people in the front, if you're tokin on blunts, say
Don't stop, the body rock
I'm too strong for you to listen
I started spittin, that's why the brick niggas be lickin
They stay on magazine printing equipments
And lyrics I got em by the shipment, where your bitch went
I'm smokin leaky out the Lec-y, fatal
My Squad steps with the ultimatum, true dat
My muzak, move crowds, like down the hill moved crack
For those who stepped on toes, I want my shoes back
Buddy, bringin money to your girl
For your little daughter like I'm Cutty
Twenty dollars a pop to dub me, I bug G, quote it
I see you noticed how I leave microphones corroded
Hahahahaha, your staff not up to par
You raw? You more like Zsa Zsa Gabor
Call deep niggas, keep the gas pedal floored
And I pump the funk to keep a room and board",On Fire

Pick it up, pick it up

While I crack a cold Beck's and keep the hoes in check
The double-S vest nigga wreck the discotheque
Sit back relax and while my Squad kick tacks
Then tap your man back and be like ""Did you see that??""
Ahh yes, comin from the North South East West
Hold your nose and take a deep breath, recess
We bless, mics, three times a day
Three times a night, it all equals subliminal sequels
Strictly laughing at MC's
Lyrics for years that run more than ten deep
Niggas be like ""Ahh he changed his style up""
Shut the fuck up, ya still a dick-ridah
It's nine-six so get wit' it
Peep that back-in-the-day shit when that other Squad was Hit-tin
Listen, must we forget, I originated
All that wild shit, that rrraahh rrraaoowww shit
That jump up and ready to fuck shit up now shit
Brick City!! Is where I get down kid
Peace to all my buddah smokers on Prince
Fuck what ya heard, Brick City runs shit

First of all, MC's be on my balls, straight up
Pubic hairs and everything, lick the whole plate up
Bay Area, roll up your Las Vegas
To all MC's, I love it that you hate us
Drop skills that might send wind chill factors
Back through Patterson, J.C
And Hacken-sack
Step uncorrect and get blackened
The assassin, find da MC's by the jazz men
I don't tote guns I tote funds
While you still puzzled how my antidote runs
Your whole vocabulary's played out, admit it
Still wack if it came out my mouth and I spit it (Get on down)
You remind me of school on a Sunday
No class, beatin all King's down
Doin over seventy, in a Hyundai, blast
Give em a good reason to open Alcatraz
Back, nobody got the Red shook
Been a weirdo ever since the doctor said PUSH
Def Squad skills make it hard to overlook me
That's why the hardcore promoters still book me
You shook G, word up, hah hah

If you see a bag of weed on the floor motherfucker
What the fuck you gon do
Pick it up, pick it up

Aiyyo, don't ride the dick of these real MC's
We pull Joints like Spike and blow crews to degrees
Then we buy G's with a half a pound of dope MC's
We bag for cheese just to get weed
Smoke indoneez I'm milky like Magnese
Oh-seven-one-oh-three, rest them car thieves
Guzzlin quart for sports of all sorts
Nonchalant spark buddah on the front porch
At courts, F-U-N-K-D-O-C
S-P-O-T, feel the Solo type remedy
Then freeze.... (Get on down) hah, ha-hah
Where was I? Oh yes
Sippin on Cristal with fingers up your bitch dress
Don't play close cause jealousy make folks act loc
Another nigga smoked from impression
Second guessin my verbal weapon, you're lettin
Spit, sixteen bits, come equipped
And I still walk around with the hooked up
Motorola flip on my hip, fuck the government
Drop shit, it's a microscopic topic
How I stay mo' bent than McDonald arches
And uptown got the la-la spots
And bad ass hoes with 54-11 Reeboks
But still, I walk around with the grill
Cause niggas be blinded by this hip-hop shit for real
I ain't havin that, I'm clappin shit
Fuck this rappin shit, I cause accidents
To any, MC who wonder what got in me
To get busy, it's simply Ginger and Remi
It don't stop, Def Squad crew is hot
Fillin up your brain with supreme octane, and it's on
(Get on down)",Pick It Up
Redman,"I'm the bomb, ringing off all types alarms
My palms, be swift with the pen like Lynn Swann's
Aggravated assault, against an MC
Beat him down with the mic and all types of pedigrees
It's mad real in Da Bricks, plus I roll thick
You can quote this, I'm the Moby Dick of dopeness
Bitch, walk the walk if you talk the talk
I DK New Jerz, and DK-New York
I don't push a lot of vehicles, but I push a used one
With a tape deck, if it's feasible
Tell the truth, I don't own a Lex Coupe
But I get you souped when I rock respect due
Ice a nice nigga that wanna get diced
Slice the mic device like the body of Christ, twice
E Double if you feel me hit me once
(A breaker one, a breaker two)
Cause trouble to your family and friends
Let me cut the bullshit, just hand me yo ends
Got caught out there cause you were Mack without 10
Punch you in your chin, the rucker, bringer, live from Hell
But stay cooler than a double L
Turn a felony to a misdemeanor
Now the court subpeonaed me to get my act cleaner
Fuck that, still walk out holdin my strap, blunt, grabbing my weiner

Rock da spot
Yo

Now first of all I go for broke, check the third quarter note
I make you feel like your water broke
Can't tell whether male or female
I fucked up your frame well, the monogram can't tell
All aboard my balls, cause my dick
Don't got a lot of room for the rest of y'all
Grab on my pubics, let my music take flight
Rock indo and out-do, dick run in and out yo
Bitch, about nine inch up the clit
Can you feel me comin, yeah I usually make em shit
I shines MC's up for auction
So I can sell em on Saturday, Keith put the bat away
Let's lay in the cut, so we can break his whole anatomy down
And turn into an ass-kicking holiday
Word, I rolls with the Funklord
With more flavors than them motherfuckers on them Benetton billboards
He's bleeding get the gauze
He shoulda knew Def Squad crew is who I kill for
Push the clip in, slide the top back
Make sure it's off safety, in case he wanna counteract
Shit like that get me vexed
So I crack your ass like corn while your bitch crack my Beck's

Rock da spot
Yo

Aiyyo, catch this picture, of me in the mixture
So you won't forget the black Jack the Ripper
Sorceror offin y'all with techniques
A universal lingo, with the odd speaks
Control more blacks than Harlem week, freak
Smokin that leak at full peak
Peace to Greg Street, and underground radio technique
College radio, know I mack shit like Maceo
Yeah, the East coast West coast dick giver
I oughta be an alkie, the way I hit liver
Deliver, the milk to your door
Real raw shit you never seen before
So when you come inside, and do the front
Watch the double-pump shotgun and please don't run
Relax your minds, let your conscience be free
And get money, and G's and roll these trees

While you pussy niggaz call id, when I blaze 
You step life your wifee got a baby on the way 
The way I flex son you think I'm made out of clay 
I'm illin', my lyrics on the blocks make the killings 
I string your moms out until diapers take to chillin' 
I don't like to toot my own horn but I'm the shit 
And if you hearin' me I see you paid that twelve cent 

So peace to homey $hort Dog! 
Peace to that funky nigga Snoop Dog! 
Peace to that old nigga Dirt Dog! 
Pour some beer out on the curb for your dead Dog! 

You can call a female, a dog too (true) 
You can feed they stinkin' ass Eucanubu...Dog!
They fuck your enemies and bring the beef to you 
You got me, I left a couple in your Fubu 
A real raw dog never get jealous 
They keep they shit cocked if niggaz try to dead em 
So ask 'Face, keep your mind on your money 
I keep the stinkin' ass hoes doin' laundry...Dog!

Redman,"Yo  I gotta back ache  stomach ache diarrhea  vomiting 
Cold feet  runny nose  head ache  insomnia 
Cranky  moody  burpin' while I'm cursin' 
Baby chair tied in a suburban drinkin' burban 
I'm only three  and gotta chip Motorola 
A hoochie babysitter with snitches by the stroller 
Lyin  cryin  whinin'  teasin' 
Suckin' tities like I had years of breast feedin' 
In the beginning I was sinning 
Kept my mama back and forth 
To the hospital for the constant kickin' 
Kept them ass whippin', I'm gettin them all 
Show off like Fodolo so fuck all y'all 
Do you get your ass whipped with your mom's bad luck 
Like ahuh yeu yeu get hit by a truck 
Playin' catch a girl, fuck a girl 
Throw her in a sandwich 
Just a young boy doing grown man shit 

[Chorus] 
I'm just a young boy doing grown man shit 
I'm just a young boy doing grown man shit 
Like kickin' your ass 
I'm just a young boy doing grown man shit 
Smokin' weed 
I'm just a young boy doing grown man shit 
All day check it out 

I'm only thirteen puttin' in work 
Rockin' chinese shoes with high top converse but first 
We was all gas watchin' game of def with Bruce 
Walkin' home from the movies 
I thought about the sex often 
I even kept a heartland for them white girls on magic garden 
Light skin, chubby and shit 
Ran my mama's phone bill for callin' Biggs Biggs Biggs 
The old hands used to make them little niggaz fight 
The lead patch was the shit if you snatch it right 
And everybody knew the pattern of pac man 
Rams was 15 and that then was happenin' 
Niggaz used to get robbed at twin city 
I was cuttin' on SL's glue with a penny 
When EPMD dropped Its My Thing 
I said damn I gotta get up in this rap game 

[Chorus] 

I used to tell my Sis I'm gonna make it bitch 
So close to gettin' on I could taste the shit 
In a hot ass room cuttin' smooth operator 
In my last year at West Side High I barley made it 
Flippin eightballs, going to Montclair State 
I passed one class and still owe their ass cake 
For quick cash, Doc hit up 13th Ave 
Sell white boys oregano dash then we laughed 
That was the days now the times switched up 
Son either walk them dogs, snuff it or get snuffed 
Them ho's got triflin' but much thicker 
My weed got better so easily I fucked shit up 
I test y'all with my def squad cam 
And I don't stage show dive unless y'all amp 
To all my fans, arivaderchi to ya 
And any ho that didn't blow Doc, I never knew ya! 

Now I'm a grown man doing grown mans shit 
Now I'm a grown man doing grown mans shit 
Like still sqeezin' your titties 
I'm just a grown man doing grown man shit 
With a big ass car 
Now I'm a grown man doing grown mans shit 
Rollin' better credit 
Now I'm a grown man doing grown mans shit 
Yo yo shit is crazy 
Now I'm a grown man doing grown mans shit 
Like smackin' your ass 
Now I'm a grown man doing grown mans shit

I got the down south funk when I clown out punk-ass 
Police want to call dogs and sound off pumps 
I short your blaupunkts if you thump my tape 
Yo dial funk if you're mo' stiff than riker's isle bunks 
Get out your seat, e, spit out the beat 
The tracks plow underground concrete out the streets 
From baldies to fades, when I rock mc's wave 
More flags than puerto rican day parade 
And give up, I got the rare footage, of fiends walkin 
Barefooted off my rhyme don't dare cook it 
You might fall in to intervene 

And new jacks and they girl become pookie and that, prom queen 
That bodybag won't fit you tonight 
You want to blow up? Drop the mic, stick to the pipe 
Hand to hand my crew'll cripple your click in a fight 
Take my tapes way down south and triple the price 
Step up on the scene like whazzup? Hey suga' 
Before you cock-tease doc, how that cash put up? 
And only way I stop til your click say when 
They had enough, cause I could bump to six a.M.

Would you kill for your life? (Man listen) 
Can you get busy all night? (Man listen) 
(Yo, yo-yo) (man listen) 

My life is a rap, each song is a flashback 
Of antagonizing anxiety attacks 
The beat hits the ground and the earth cracks 
Niggaz be like, ""oh no not them!"" yeah we back 
With rhythmatic articulation, god-forsaken 
Sick manifestations, pump pump in your face then 
The lyrical force that I put in a rhyme 
Will hit you with more power than a molecule enzyme 
No matter who what when where how I'll lay you down 
With a sick illed out fictitious style 

Yo, we all represent the hood -- the only difference 
Between us is that we make the shit look good! 
Programmable annual slammable 
You lyte as a rock and I cram to understand you
So for niggaz on a mission kissin ass and dissin'

If it's hot to your crew, then it's hot to the next patient 
I'm in The Bricks like backspins on the mix 
I'm not a playa, but y'all hatin' me like I'm a pimp 
These cars y'all talk about, the Doc already whipped 
You bout to go downtown bitch, like Tha Shiznit 
Overseas bangin' cot in the parkin' lot 
I'm overdosin' in a Amsterdam coffee shop 
And when you lust for hardcore music to bust 
Trust that nigga who bubble mo' than Alka-Seltzer Cold Plus 
Static, niggaz actin' all dramatic 
I'd rather smoke cabbage, in the chair gettin' tatted 
My P.O. tried to violate me for the habit 
Because I walked in the office rockin' straight karats

Gonna ride in the hoop' with a freak tonight 
Hope to God I don't have to pull the heat tonight

Get dap like the Mad Rapper, ""Who da fuck are you?"" 
The Loaded Desperado, I'm cooler than Rollo 
(Aiyyo, what you hittin' Doc?) I'm hittin' hoes up in the Tahoe 
Gettin' chickens fightin' in the back of the Apollo 
Say, ""Fuck dat!"" if I'm a tough act to follow

Only right I spiral the hot shit that I know

And get a gangsta bitch who love robbin' shit!

You don't stop y'all, it don't stop nigga 
I turn an independent woman back into a hoochie 
Make a Jew rock a Dashiki and a Kufi

Put rappers under pressure, with no cooker 
 
Rock it to a T. like Booker, you're straight shook up 
I can't hang with pussy niggaz who be scared as hell to push up 
Too much money and, not enough time 
It be, too many thugs and not enough nines 
Hey hoe, here come five-oh, stash the blow

Yea i'm gonna let the gorrilas up in your building 
Kick your door, shoot up the ceiling 
Snatch the coke, kidnapp the children 
Don't start lying about your tire being flat 
Or catching a allergy attack 
I'll axe the battle and the bat 
Saddling them ho's like yeeehaw! 
Bitch enjoy the tour when you're fuckin 
the Doc 5 O'clock free ride 
Ambulance too late for them 
These paper thin niggaz robbin' at the ATM with a staple gun

And smash the hardest artist regardless in steez 
I'm heartless with these (you ready) cock it and squeeze

Guaranteed to blow your vision if we engage in collision 
Talk slick and be laid out in chalk

Every week, check stubs to show the judge I got a job 
Damn this; Soopaman used to stack them chips

I'm not a hater but the Caped Crusader blockin my dough 
And I'll let off before I push broom on HBO for Mr. Show

Police is lookin for me, call the mayor he'a hang up 
Nowhere to run to and Brownstone even know it 
So I pack the fo'-fifth, and the ice on your wrist, forfeit 
No game; slappin all hoes who got the fame 
Then I rob em with chickens who got phone bills in they mama name 
(You've been framed!) Yeah yeah I know I gotta go out

But when night time comes tha monkeys come out
Crackheads, hustlers, chickens, carjackers, thieves, hoes
All these mutherfuckers come out when the lights go out

Don't matter how large your crew is
Don't matter what city your stinkin' ass is representin'
Give a fuck how much money you got nigga

While y'all stash clips in bags of Bar-B-Q potato chips
Plus your main honey loved us
Slip her some bom-ba she'll fuck twenty of us

Yo, you pack that little ass gun like Harlem Nights
After we brawl and fight, yo bitch I'ma ball tonight
At shows we so tight we flow like it's one mic
Raw underground, yo Don, tell em what that dough like

D. Don, I gets mine, and stay gettin' it
My thug mind'll brawl with rhymes and stay shittin' it
Check my shine, iced out platinum like your pendant
V.I.P. ghetto nigga, hustlin' and spendin'
Got bitches trickin' tryin' to get with me
Got police, flock niggaz tryin to cop from me
How many pouns you want, how many pounds you need?
I cultivate, every block I go and drop seeds nigga
I grow trees, niggaz know me, for bein' low key
That hustler from A.C.

I'm steady shittin' on hoes, Grand Royal like the Green Eyed Bandit
Jump straight in the Lex offa New Jersey transit
Let my man spit that Don shit
Gov-Matic spit that shit that's toxic, I rock shit
It's that hot shit like Busta Bust got
Plus I bust glock, on pussies I trust not
They get blown, burned like minutes on cell phone
Bring the terror to your block like the toughest nigga from jail home
And you dead gone when my squad come around
We hella illa from Isabella to Downtown",Boohdah Break
Redman,"From a place that had no meaning
From the wilderness of time
To the land of new beginning
Starting with a new design
Never doubted for a second
That I'd do it on my own
And I held onto my corner
Trusted in the things I know 

You will never feel
How good it is to love me
Rather than control me
I don't need the world weighing down my shoulders
But that's all over here I am

I made it back
From a place called nowhere
I made it back
To do this once again
I made it back
From a place called nowhere
I made it back
Once again I made it back
 
Got a chance to fix up neatly
Set it off and not too late
Saw the light and walked towards it
I'm the master of my late
Coming up just wasn't easy
It took all the strength I had
Now I'm ready for the action
Mamma got a brand nu bag

How good it is to love me
Rather than control me

Soopaman Luva flyin' through the f***in' sky
I'm lookin' for my mojo, I'm fried chinky-eyed
My cape is still tore up, but I make a lil' money
I'm like Ace Ventura, duckin' my landlord
The land of the poor, where I handle my biz
I got a weed spot on the block Hannibal live
Pokemon on the pipe, Rudolph the deer Red-Nose
Glow in the night, when his nose gettin' right

I pimp Snow and Vanna White on the hoe stroll
Dr. Ruth on E, sippin' Old Gold, Mr. T on crack, mohawk cornrow
In South Park with the Chef, in the stolen Ford
I'm lookin' for my mojo, where it at?
Got a APB on it dawg, where it at? I ran into Cita, from BET
She said, ""Man is a n****, that's fast on the trigger
I thought he was you, when we had the party for two
My girlfriend said the same, majority rules""

Damn, who takin' my women?
Who takin' my chickens around thanksgiving? Now that's pimpin'
Called my man Meth and Bishop Don Juan
He smokin' a blunt, other sippin' Sean Don
He said it ain't the game, but how you play it
So I can't hate the game, so I'm dyin' to play it
Now I'm back in the air, ready to put my smack down
I'm searchin' for the impostor to pat down

I'm urgin' to put the glock up and clap rounds
It's curtains like Jimmy Hoffa, he not found
So ride on me, try homey
Your plan'll fail like the Acme Kit from Coyote
Now I'ma find the bastard that stole my juice
Soopaman Part Five, in your archives

I'm yo Soopaman baby, that's who I am
Flyin' through the air, without a care
I'm high as hell blazin', that Cali weed
That Kryptonite bud, that sticky green

We gon' take it down like this, yo, D-Don, Don..

[D-Don]
It's bone-afficial my nizzle
D-Don got issues, and a type team that dismiss you
Oh boy! I gets more +Chips+ than +Ahoy!+
I got toys that deploy, I just aim and destroy
I keeps it gully in a bonafide skully
I ain't never had a hit but still get props like Nelly
I'm platinum in streets I got, love in the streets
And I'm more underground than your, basement concrete
Braids in my hair, gold still in my teeth
Still, bringin the beef if you're, bringin me grief
I, rat-a-tat-tat it like one-two one-two
Cock my shit back and let off on your whole crew
I'm Brick City baby twenty-fo'/seven
A project nigga that's, tryin to see heaven
I done ran through hell with gasoline drawers on (AOWW!)
I'm the portrait of a hustler, and once again it's on
I still got money buried in my back yard
I'm Bumpy like Johnson, they call me D-Don
My shit's so dope when you smoke you nod
And I spit that shit that leave you holy like the song

[Pacewon]
Yo.. we from the place where they pump out D and steal cars
Kids wild wave at you and smile you feel large
like they cut, and you got the power to heal scars
Never down cause the underground crown is still large
See I rap for a livin, probably rap 'til I die
If you dope, where you been at? Your raps is a lie
I'm all real, the one, the raw deal
Do tour, come home, do a flick for four mill'
What the hardcore heads on the block would call ill
Never catch me at the ball-out spot with small bills
Innovative rapper, rhyme in new ways
When I spit niggaz cough up blood for two days
Never catch me with material girls, they fugaz'
Rather bounce with a short chickenhead in blue shades
'Til the day I'm rich like Bruce Wayne
I'ma kick raps like pimps blew game
Ridin through your block with six new chains on
Pullin over droppin H-bombs
No doubt I got it locked Sanford Ave. to Penn Station
Chancellor to Central a thousand men waitin

[Chorus - 2X w/ minor variations]

You heard me light the Dutch (smokin weed)
Rock on like what the fuck (what the fuck?)

[Roz]
Fuckin with me is a close call out of my crew
Don't try it I fuckin roast why'all, you and your co-stars
Next up to bat, I done had enough of cats
Blast tracks like what the fuck was that?
Roz spit rawness
State to state, hood streets and block corners
Rhymes hold so much weight, the feds on us
Lot of niggaz didn't want to see me last
But I won't stop just slow down like Easy Pass
Back up and give the are room
Or we gon' brawl worse than cartoons in bar rooms
In my city they don't pop they collar
Cats that do, get shot drop and holla
I'm from the be	-are-I, see-K-S
And my, squad is hot, any beef they bless
Any, squad that test gon' meet they death
Ask yourself, do you really need that stress?

[Shooga Bear]
Aiyyo, I project my voice so it's right in the crowd
There's a sign at the door, no bitin allowed
Plus the blows that I throw bring a light in the sound
So whoever want the drama I'm invitin them now
Phenomenal shit, spit 'til my abdominal split
Plus combined lines so minds demolish a click
Still burn MC's like Everclear, never fear
With razor sharp skills so ill they, sever ears
Hard to the roots a hundred proof with no chaser
Scarves and some boots a hundred troops with chrome bangers
Now rock with me, I spray blocks with glock fifties
Still when I spit I flip like Spock sent me
And never gave a fuck what a rapper grossed
But if they, brag and boast I'ma clap the toast
why'all can analyze this, watch me paralyze clicks
And sabotage why'all, I ain't a fan of why'all shit

[Double O]
I'm a nasty ass disease, and now I got ya mouth celibate
I'm a direct descendant of Hannibal's elephants
That's word to mother, them damn jokes is over
You gon' run your mouth like a motor 'til I fuck up the rotor
It's Double O again, still runnin, still gunnin
It's like I got a cast-iron dick, I'm still cummin
Talkin that killer shit like you blood raw
And ain't even did ten minutes in the back of a squad car
Be big niggaz to they weak, I'm true to the streets
why'all niggaz is half-assed like one booty cheek
I'm (??), why'all is Swiss Miss
My camp'll make your army pull back like a slipped disc
It be the Bricks again, with me with them steel rods
It ain't right unless Shane, Tariq, and Raouf Nayim is involved
I did ery'thang from robberies to dope
And why'all just lie about it, like it's a big-ass joke
Playin like kids, I think you want me to spank you
Ninety-nine on the charts with a ship anchor on your ankle
And if you niggaz don't like what I say
I'm in Newark on Market and Hasley e'ry fuckin day

Brick City, Jersey, I got the weed, homie
Na, na, na chill, chill, chill, na, na chill , where the weed at
It's da bullshit, bullshit, yo where the weed at fellas, what you lightin'

Yo, yo, you motherfuckers gon' learn
When it come to this shit, I ain't about takin' turns
'Cause Doc's in the place, the cold nigga, I'm too late to thaw
Doc unfold niggas 'til they ribs is raw

Whether you up the ball or ride the bitch
My pens write with a vengeance and Viagra in
Stay hard like the biceps when it's stacked
I'm gritty, I wouldn't love in a tennis match

I don't like to sign autographs half the time
I scribble my name and draw a jackass design
Calvin Kleins spilled on the floor, you just got
Dogged on the tour, so, send some new whores, H O

I got a food table to warm, a new neighbor to warn
And people at the label I'm on
Crunch time, what you think the forty-four is for
When I grub, I want the whole smorgas board

Gotta clean my act up and, get my thoughts straight
Stop smashin' the five and appear in the court dates
I won't ride the bike unless it's C B R
With no tricks but a bitch it'll be on next

I'm still wheel handlin, you die in a ambulance
Block prime scramblin', glock nine handlin'
Duckin' the flows of mind travelin'
You heard it before, you ain't Sunshine Anderson

Got a bomb plantin' and I'm ready for more
Bitches gettin' in my party givin' head at the do
All my niggas and my shorty's and get high in the audience
I carry a gaudy gun, you'll die in the audience

That's the bullshit, the bullshit
We walk up in the club we on the bullshit
That's the bullshit, the bullshit
Fondling your bitch ass off the bullshit

That's the bullshit, the bullshit
Brick City, Brook-non off the bullshit
That's the bullshit, that's the bullshit
That's the- nah, nah, nah, nah, chill nigga
That's the bullshit

Yo, I put the pressure on a man without a gun in my hand
His limpin' lenny turn around and then I pump from the pants
One nine in each arm, I get hot as I squeeze from it
Now he's a cheap ornament, died in a street tournament

Peep the clues, not deep with dudes
My Benz don't carry shoes 'cause I'm cheap as Jews
But I let off this cannon bet your fleet would move
After that I tell you and what the beat to do

Fuck the Visine, duck when I lean out the window
With a shottie with me and myself and Irene and my team
Fuck your mainstream dry off feet
I'm explosive as Simon in Die Hard 3

Now you wavin' six flags like you at GA
'Cause my gun on standby like a flight delay
Sprayin' water on all those whoever's hot
Take they mic, take they jewels, then them Bezell, Doc

Stop IC-Don, get gone, nigga I'm here
Sippin' a beer, 5th with the clip in the rear
That'll lift him off his feet, make him flip in the air
I pull big guns out, like I'm hittin' a deer

You don't really know when trouble come
When you open your door and somebody
In yo, house chewin' bubble gum
With double guns, cocked in each hand
Nigga, you about to be buried in beach sand

I don't care if you broke or not
I don't care if you sell weed, dope, coke or not
Nigga, I still smoke the glock
Give your face polka dots, y'all better hope I stop

Man doom, I kidnap a classroom
Hide 'em in the left wing of my bathroom
Do you think you could survive all that we bring, ya
Bullets, comin' at ya just as long as your finger

And every, morning I linger on the corner just drinkin'
Borin' and thinkin', how I'm 'bout to score with this ink pen
You better hope we blow on this rappin' shit
You don't want us to go under the mattresses

Shorty lookin' at me funny like I don't get bank
My house is hot bitch, I swim in my fish tank
Every car got a bar, the whole clique drink
I'm a dirty nigga, nuts sweaty, dick stink

After we fuck, I'm takin' you to S and D's
That's a lie bitch I am on ecstasy
I won't remember none of this when the X in me
So if you want sex for free, check for me, IC-Don

Yo, dat bitch, splittin' cigars better than me

An' you see my name when the track is on

With her toes in a pump with a shotgun pumped out
Dat bitch, that'll roll proper, two phones
One for tricks an' one for callin' the Doctor

I produce joints that loosen up the socket
Crowd surf through the mosh pit on some rock shit
Bang your head to this, pump your fist if your feelin' it
Ride the fuck out, bust a clip for the fuck of it
This is as good as it get, who you rollin' with? (You)

And drop heat on the streets through zero degree storms
And keep the ghetto, pop your metal
Smoke it like a cigarette till ya optic yellow
The addiction, ain't no friction

Take your street work, let your bitch pump it
I'm your next door tenant, that'll strip you down

Half my brain is still experimentin

Stickin the Easter Bunny for sneaker money

The gorilla in the motherfuckin mix
They call him Lethal Lip
The linguistic full metal jacket of vernacular ballistic
Shootin off at the mouth without chap or a blister
He got hairs on his funk and didn't flunk diaper rash
Gorilla goin postal.. verbally toxic
Metal pierced forked and hollow point tongue
dumb-dums piled shot from gamblin gorilla gums
Hooked on phonics, packin a viscious vocabulary
Malicious with malice and mayhem
Fuck a gorilla dictionary, Magilla Gorilla talkin to ya

The street volume up to ten

My dress code is all black
When I'm makin' the moves
Similar to the new PlayStation 2
I can't help it if the club
Only packin' a G
And the fire marshal want to
Shut it down in 3
And you ballin' as* niggaz
Whose dressed to kill
For the h*es showin' the toes
With extra heels (man)
I gotta get in, I drove here
With a carload of bitches
Charged on Belvedere
My niggaz hit the cells
If the line is thick
So I drive the 500, through
The door of the bitch

Blazin' like Biggie passed us
A semi in here
Don't sleep, stay wide awoke
You dialed Doc, not dial-a-joke
Crawl or you'll die in smoke
I keep it heated when the hawk is out
Seated low Tahoe, beat it
When the dark is out
I'm outside of the line
And I'm actin' a fool
Like a three o'clock bully
Waitin' after school

This line for hours
I even killed the time by helpin'
My man pass out fliers
Now all I want to do is
Get in where I fit in
Shake my as* with the
Baddest pidgeon with her wig in
Jump, move, crash
Smoke, drink
Shake that as* stank
The fuck you think?
Poppa Bear at the table, and
The porridge is pourin'

I'm walkin' half-dead, actin' senile
With bigga niggaz from jail

From fuckin' round with the Midack
Eleven, twenty-four, act 47

Fuck who's standin' around them get close up and down an'
I done came here to get brains
Shoot you twice in your stomach
Then leave your boxin' shorts full of shit stains

You're, bitch maid, you ain't a gangsta, you a sucker ass
These niggaz, scared of your bark, but bitch I touch ass
And bust back, what's that, it's face mob in effect
With Icarus, Reggie, Jamal and Treach

I told you that talkin' wasn't shit to me
So bitch be more specific when you spit for me
It ain't shit to me, you a hoe in fifth degree, a discharge from a dick
Disease, you lil' maggot, part time thug for a faggot
Plastic ass chump, you don't want no static

Yo, yo, yo, it's Funk Doc, I thought you knew
P P P in the back an' they parkin' to, jump

I fuck chicks off Elmo Flicks

My tape is off safety, tongue the gun
Mouth to barrel, I spit, it numbs the front
So what cha, what cha wanna, yo, my boys is beastie
We grew up untamed, unemployed an' eatin'

You sharks in the water, avoid the deep end
We only fuck chicks that enjoys the beatings
Young Ike Turners, disco inferners
Concentration camp, nobody turn up

I roll up a X that came with kits
Leave you with nightmares, Dana Dane was with
I can train yo' bitch, with a chain an' whip
It blow the block down while I change the clip

Yo, don't approach me wrong, little kids call me 'Smokey-mon'
'Cause the blunts that I light set off smoke alarms
And I stand on the corner 'til my coke is gone
Niggaz, wanna get they ice picks, poke the don

But they know I got a gun big as Oprah's arm
And I know a old lady, that'll choke their moms
A attitude, that's what I don't walk without
Nigga, I'ma time for it, you just talk about

Ic is the man, and I never been to Japan
Got a Japanese bitch, with my dick in her hand
This is the plan, I'm about to get in the van
Go and get rid of the man, I done did it again

Skunk I blow, then off to the trunk I go
Pull the pump out slow, dump out foe

I look a nigga, eye to eye when I speak
I'm transparent, I can see if you a killer or a freak
Or a bitch that'll do anythin' to get rich
Or a snitch that'll drop dime on the click

Or a fake, that'll rather see me at my wake
Or a Jake tryin' to infilitrate, give me a case

[Verse Two]
Nigga, we go - oops, upside your head
+Simon Says+ leave you hogtied instead
On the floor with ya shirt like I dyed it red
Wild wild Bricks, eighty foot spider legs
Doc in, double-oh, learned to drive it
I'm, on the roof, guns under the armpit
Yellin out, ""Yo sawed off, hand on the pump
and I'll pump a cannon first man that jump"" {*clik-clik, BLAM!*}
I got a punch that'll cut your beard up
Doc is like warm when you touch my earmuffs
I wild out, throw blows
_Somethin about Mary_ rode me in a Ford Explorer
The pressure at time five remind me
that why'all can't eat like it's Ramadan week
My mascot was built for kamikaze
If it fails, L.O.D. right behind me

Redman,"This is WKYA, We Kickin Yo' Ass radio
All you motherfuckers out there that want to get down with the pound
put your motherfuckin' pounds up, and start bustin' the motherfuckers
Am I too loud for this motherfucker? Turn me down a little bit
Yeah yeah yeah

Yo, first of all I'm a grown-ass man, pay my own bills
Stated own real, haters gon' feel
Direct Syndrome, mouth with cold tongue
You bounty hunters be on the chase for Joe Young
I won't slip, keep pink slips to my car
I'm raw like sushi bars on bougie broads
I retrieve the money, dawg labrador
Ray Charles can see it, and Stacy Lattisaw
You get mashed out, cause your bird is peckin'
Don't be the next vinyl cut to Urban Legend
I can feel where you at, when I pound you up
You out of town coke rhymes, oh you clowns is up
My crew stay in the truck, can't fit in the Porsche
If you bitches ain't happy, then get a divorce
I'ma do what I want, cause my time is now
Grab the whole rap game, and divide it down

If I want to roll a Jeep with a seat out the back
Bitch feet out the back, system beat out the track
Am I wrong for dat? (If that's what you like)
Dawg, am I wrong for dat? (Hey, I guess not)
Yo yo, if I walk into the club with my hand on my snub
Beatin down security cause I don't give a fuck
Am I wrong for dat? (Mmm mmm)
Dawg, am I wrong for dat? (Say what)

I copped the whole box, went half with Reginald
Hollow tips infrareds and clips came free
And you ain't gotta believe me, fuck bein' nervous
Far as I'm concerned they're at your funeral service
What do we have here? Snitch in despair, shoot off his ear
Have his whole body shakin' in fear
Stormtrooper fires throwin' lashin' out flames
A few ashes, when they analyze your remains
I live in the streets, reside with the toolie
I kill you like it's part of my religious duty
Street sweeper thug keeper sweepin' thugs under the rug
Even females who think they thugs
Trigger the release of adrenaline
When I'm gangsta-trippin' like the Bloods'n'Crips'n'them
Unleash the matter of energy, killin' 'em
Why'd you do it? Because I wasn't feelin' them!

If I ride through the hood, smokin' a ounce of haze (uh-huh)
with a shabby haircut, pants I wore for days
Am I wrong for dat? (I don't think so)
C'mon bitch, am I wrong for dat? (Say what)
Yo, if I want a fat chick that keep her toes done (uh-huh)
When they playin' my song ass spill out the thong
Am I wrong for dat? (Got that big ass)
Am I wrong for dat? (Tchk, no)

I gotta, bang the boogie to that bang bang pussy
To that bang to the pussy the beat, beat
And if yo', bitch ain't sippin' that Cristal shit
Then she might be leavin' with D, D

Na, na, na chill, chill, chill, na, na chill , where the weed at
It's da bullshit, bullshit, yo where the weed at fellas, what you lightin'

Yo, yo, you motherfuckers gon' learn
When it come to this shit, I ain't about takin' turns
'Cause Doc's in the place, the cold nigga, I'm too late to thaw
Doc unfold niggas 'til they ribs is raw

Whether you up the ball or ride the bitch
My pens write with a vengeance and Viagra in
Stay hard like the biceps when it's stacked
I'm gritty, I wouldn't love in a tennis match

I don't like to sign autographs half the time
I scribble my name and draw a jackass design
Calvin Kleins spilled on the floor, you just got
Dogged on the tour, so, send some new whores, H O

I got a food table to warm, a new neighbor to warn
And people at the label I'm on
Crunch time, what you think the forty-four is for
When I grub, I want the whole smorgas board

Gotta clean my act up and, get my thoughts straight
Stop smashin' the five and appear in the court dates
I won't ride the bike unless it's see be are
With no tricks but a bitch it'll be on next

I'm still wheel handlin, you die in a ambulance
Block prime scramblin', glock nine handlin'
Duckin' the flows of mind travelin'
You heard it before, you ain't Sunshine Anderson

Got a bomb plantin' and I'm ready for more
Bitches gettin' in my party givin' head at the do
All my niggas and my shorty's and get high in the audience
I carry a gaudy gun, you'll die in the audience

We walk up in the club we on the bullshit
That's the bullshit, the bullshit
Fondling your bitch ass off the bullshit

That's the bullshit, that's the bullshit
That's the- nah, nah, nah, nah, chill nigga
That's the bullshit

Yo, I put the pressure on a man without a gun in my hand
His limpin' lenny turn around and then I pump from the pants
One nine in each arm, I get hot as I squeeze from it
Now he's a cheap ornament, died in a street tournament

Peep the clues, not deep with dudes
My Benz don't carry shoes 'cause I'm cheap as Jews
But I let off this cannon bet your fleet would move
After that I tell you and what the beat to do

Fuck the Visine, duck when I lean out the window
With a shottie with me and myself and Irene and my team
Fuck your mainstream dry off feet
I'm explosive as Simon in Die Hard 3

Now you wavin' six flags like you at GA
'Cause my gun on standby like a flight delay
Sprayin' water on all those whoever's hot
Take they mic, take they jewels, then them Bezell, Doc

Stop IC-Don, get gone, nigga I'm here
Sippin' a beer, 5th with the clip in the rear
That'll lift him off his feet, make him flip in the air
I pull big guns out, like I'm hittin' a deer

You don't really know when trouble come
When you open your door and somebody
In yo, house chewin' bubble gum
With double guns, cocked in each hand
Nigga, you about to be buried in beach sand

I don't care if you broke or not
I don't care if you sell weed, dope, coke or not
Nigga, I still smoke the glock
Give your face polka dots, y'all better hope I stop

Man doom, I kidnap a classroom
Hide 'em in the left wing of my bathroom
Do you think you could survive all that we bring, ya
Bullets, comin' at ya just as long as your finger

And every, morning I linger on the corner just drinkin'
Borin' and thinkin', how I'm 'bout to score with this ink pen
You better hope we blow on this rappin' shit
You don't want us to go under the mattresses

Shorty lookin' at me funny like I don't get bank
My house is hot bitch, I swim in my fish tank
Every car got a bar, the whole clique drink
I'm a dirty nigga, nuts sweaty, dick stink

After we fuck, I'm takin' you to S and D's

How you feeling, and we gon' hooo-oooh-ooh
Tell me what you doin'
C'mon, yo yo-yo yo, yo yo

I had to put the mash down, throw the cash around
Stay focused, on the case put the hash down
Jetted through the air about five miles per hour
My mojo gone I can't fly like I wanna

But this case is easy, find that motherf***er that
Couldn't wait to be me, put his face on TV
From the tec blow, I asked my ex-hoes
Pa** off some info for a pair of X.O.'s

Write the check low, I don't do that
I told you that s*** before when I boned your back
Now I'm back to square one, and everybody hatin'
So I popped the flare gun, now they all escapin'

Ran into Gator, for Jungle Fever
He's my people and my neighbor, I said I need a favor
He said for ten dollars, and for ten Whoppers
From Burger King, I'll tell you the n**** who gotcha

Gave him what he wanted plus the extra large fry
He said blue eyes, blonde hair, a white guy
I said what the f*** goin' on?
A white guy interruptin' my f*** flowin' on?

So I copped some new ammo, reloaded my flare gun
Stalkin' like Rambo, mixed with Commando
Gator pushed the ten-speed bike, I'm on the handle
Crashed into somethin' 'cause he high off my man blow

I jumped up and backtracked myself
Who's the last hoe I f***ed or throat I cut?
I said wait a minute, yo, that b**** Jane on the prowl again
I bet she up to no good, actin' foul again

Yeah, yeah, it ain't nuttin', I get her if I want her
Matter of fact I'm gonna 'cause she live around the corner
I walked up scared with my hands on my flares and my armor
'Cause she bring drama like Jeffrey Dahmer

But I heard f***in' all the way from the bottom
I'm like, damn she yellin' kinda made me jealous
Knocked on the door enraged
Like a broke-a** rapper, at a label that ain't toured in days

Do it clown, before I count to four now
'Cause if I hit five them flares'll blow your door down
I heard the zipper zip up, and they was tryin' to run
So I re-clipped the clip up, and blew it before one

Freeze motherf***ers, I jumped on Jane back
I want the cheese motherf***ers and my name back
We tusslin', fightin', bitin' skin and rustlin'
Slaps in the face, chokes with the belt buckle

And her knees bucklin', I thought to myself
Where's that motherf***in' white guy she was f***in', then
Right out of the blue

But still, with my eyes closed, they both blend
I'm not a follower, I start the trend
Y'all can follow that dummy
I'mma follow this money
Now I'm at the age, where I need to get paid
If a nickel bag gets sold in the park - heyyyyyyy!
Did I stu-stutter?
I got the guns and butter
My craftwork be movin' the numbers
I keep a (Roscoe) like Kurupt, brother
Hang out my window - BLAOW!
What up, fucker?
Violence sells, but I ain't a violent male
But if you violate, I'll play the violin well
From Bricks to Park Hill
Don't be like Zoolander, waitin' for that Blue Steel
To be shown on your grill

[Chorus: Ready Roc]
This is Brick City! [gun shots]
Hear the gunshots, where they hate cops [sirens]
On every block, there's a weed spot
This is Brick City! [gun jams]
Hear the gun jam, if you don't run fam-I-ly with a suntan
This is Brick City! [rapid-fire gunshots]
Hear the gun spit, niggas jump ship
Where we spit, 'cause we run shit
Play pussy wit' us
And get fucked quick
Who got the duchess?

Yo, right here! Yeah!

Okay? Big Ben and all that fuckin bullshit

(Gilla House, ya heard?)

You fuckin Muppets, you fuckin cunts!

(Gilla.. Gilla.. Gilla.. let's go!)


[Redman]

Yo, yo

Muscle my way in, old fathers mine

Tattooed Gilla, feelin in my prime

Pull up a Coupe a color niggaz can't find

Plasma TV on the mirror outside

I overdo it strong, got chicks that buck ya down

from Vietnam that look like Nia Long

I'm hot, my collar stand up like The Fonz

To hold my guns you need wet and karma bombs

You got chubby? I got chubby too

Me starve in the park, nigga you on ComicView

You funny, I flood the area tsunami

Wash out the weak niggaz, then I tag 'em _Dry Me_

I'm married to the game, the brass my music

When Brick's in the house, there's a problem Houston!

I guzzle Crunk Juice to the neck

So when I walk in the party ain't nobody gon' do shurrr

Redman is shurrr, it's the principality

Oven like wurrrm for the lyrics I burrrn

Nigga wait your turrrn, we can battle in a second

So I can bankrupt ya like, Chapter 11

I'm the shit like Janet Jackson undressin

Believe it, when I quarterback you receive it

Same crib on MTV Cribs mine

I ain't lyin cause my eyes redder than iodine

I'm back muh'fucker, so up your chain

I'ma leave the same way I came, that's thorough

I run up in your hood like 80 deep

Have it sound like _Drumlines_ at A&T, muh'fucker


[Chorus: Redman]

Gilla House - check, Def Squad - check

White tee - check, Goretex - check

When we said we number one - we lied

We number one two three four AND five

Gilla House - check, Brick City - check

89 - check, cash yo - check

""They don't give a fuck about what y'all niggaz doin""

{*scratch: ""Holla at your be-boy-boy!*}


[Redman]

If you find a bag of weed on the floor, pick it up

And if you find it I got 10 on the dub

I'm hard to find like pickin weed out a rug

I'm worldwide fool, I don't care about a buzz

Dawn of the Red, goin for the bread

I got pitbulls hooked on to a sled

My block'll riot like they shot Cornbread

The Pres'll find a missile with a foreign head

KABOOM! Guess who stepped in the room?

Streetsweeper out, ready to vacumn

Then all of a sudden, you get it in the end

Like Kane from Marlena cousin, I'm a menace

I was broke as hell, first time I made it

Now e'rything I own is voice activated

Boy I'm lyin, I'm just tryin to make cheddar

Cause my doorbell is rubbin two wires together


[Chorus: Redman]

Gilla House - check, Wu-Tang - check

White tee - check, Nike Air - check

When we said we number one - we lied

We number one two three four AND five

Yo, Redman 'Back in Business' like E-P-M
D whips I drive, I gotta TV'em
I tour New York down, so B.B. King 'em
Found my way back home like E.T. finger
I rock the arena, you know the drill
Get high, get drunk, grab a hoe and chill
Eat a meal, then back to the hood for more action
Promotin' Red Gone Wild with no backin
Doc get five on the mic like Joe Jackson
Foreign bitches feelin' me for my accent
Talk like a boss, I can't complain
When I do it, it's big like Fulton in St. James
I got Brick City, even D.C. bitches
They all steal for me outta P.C. Riches
I move like a pimp, but I'm far from one
Like Lil Weez, I got army guns
Gimmie one, nigga

And here comes the 3 to the 2 and 1 (Gimmie one, nigga)

And here comes the 2 to the 3 and 4

Yo, If you don't like me, fuck you, I flex one muscle
Doc got more effects than kung fu hustle
I'm uptown, buyin' the perk
Lookin' cut clean, jeans, ? designer shirt
Redman fell off, what the talks about?
I wasn't lettin' y'all swim when the shark was out
Rollin red carpet out, it's Jersey
Me and them together is like Lil' Seymour and Big Percy
I knew women from high school that picked on me
Now I see them, they all wanna lick on me
I hood down homie, rock like Bon Jovi
I can work the night shift like he Brian Mobley
Brick City, boy, my flow is on fire
Disagree, I go in your mouth like botox
Pick up Pete Rock, nigga, we all cool
Hit the highway and ask, ""Is the CL smooth?"" nigga

[Chorus]

Your style might be parkay, but mine butter
That bitch can't break no bread, then why fuck her
I'm kinda cocky, homeboy, did I stutter?
I pop the umbilical cord on my mother
I jumped out the womb, I became a whale
That's hard to harpoon, I need more room
The hood love me, so I keep it real gully
I got handsome, but my flow is still ugly
Turn the treble out the track and I'll jet
I lines in my rhyme are longer than Ikea
I stay on my grind, but when I come up with an Idea
The year, is party over here
It's 5 years I disappeared, but I'm back
And tell Nino Brown and them that I'm crack
Grab my bozack, middle finger is up
I got your grandma givin' it up

You know the loud ones, they do a whole lot of duckin'

End up in Jersey now, a whole lot of blood
So when you get here show a whole lot of love
Or leave shot up, robbed and thrown out a truck

I'm a East Coast legend, you should know 'bout me
This is for my 'hood bitches and real OG's

[Chorus]

Look in my eyes nigga
You see a great ball of fire nigga
My trail is blazin', that's right, I'm high nigga
A hard hip hop hitman for hire nigga
My rims are so big, I fucked my alignment up
Grown as hell, I don't throw signs nigga
I continue to Flipmode's like Rah Digga
Barbershop talk, come get you a line nigga
It's permanent press steam on the iron nigga
(Put it down, put it down, put it down girl)
Wherever you pop shit you get found there
Bitch you hot, little tacky with the horse hair
Gillahouse, it's your year and it's on baby

Do ""The Freak"" on the floor, two steps to the side
Talk greasy like Popeye's breast and a thigh

One hit of this bitch, your whole staff is (out of control) {""Ohh!""}
I'm programmed for winnin, Sean John to denim
Fly guy got shoes with fish in water swimmin
You pointed me out, bad guy with the mouth
I'm Oscar, no wonder muh'fucker I'm a (Grouch)

You tried to hide before your NexTel chirp!

Holiday Inn 'em, then back in the shuttle van
Bitch give me head on the first date, what a fan

With a mean street team outside posted up
Toasted up, ready to roast a duck (uh-huh)
When I say street team, I don't mean niggaz that put posters up (word)
Let's be blatant, you achin and ancient
We capered in your hood with dirty machetes and bloody aprons
I'll acquire a tec, quiet your rep
Stay quiet as deaf, or Kanye's choir rep (uh-huh)
As I make another left, quiet I crept, quiet you slept
I'm back with the tec, like I never left (surprise niggaz!)
See frivolous beef'll get you curiously shot (uh-huh)
You fuckin with Keith, I think seriously not (hell no)
I ATTACK like a blue-nose pit off gunpowder (yeah)
And love to soup the beef up just like clam chowder
With my Squad in the house, we misbehave
Get drunk and tongue-kiss bitches like Flavor Flav

Yo, Brick City, when it comes to grabbin' steel
You could post me down low like Shaq O'Neil
You'll be spittin' what I spit when the day is over
Tryin' to be me in the mirror, sayin' it over

Yeah, he's all right, but you not real
I'm a dog, s*** I eat the food I steal
Floors ain't dirty enough
My game is like carryin' shotguns and 21 rough

Doctor, I'm like the war on drugs
I don't stop, I'm all night vampire blood
Underground chud, since a kid
I finger painted in the mud, with dirty work gloves

I'm in yo' college campus corridor
You should call me Uno, the way I draw four
Brick City law, strip to your drawers
Boy now I can pick up two pair from the mall

It's time for Doc to check yo' a*** n***
It ain't hard, it's an easy pass n***
For the paper, I'm offendin' neighbors
Runnin' my label out an old Winnebago n***

Ooh, shoulda knew that we gon' bring that funk to you
(Yeah, the Brick City dawgs, yeah, holla at your frogs)
Gilla House, is comin' through and Wutchoogonnado
(Uptown Jersey, Brooklyn)

Shh, Gilla, Gilla, Gilla, Gilla
Yo, uh, oh, Redman back in your town
You'll get drug n*** like wedding gowns
After 12, whattup to Dogg Pound

I roll out, like my earrings got ball bearings
Give me a Grammy to show my mammy
How I smash these Raggedy Ann and Andy's
I prove that I never left the street

I just knew I had to come back, with extra heat for y'all
Be-More are ya ready? Colorado are ya ready?
I'm at your neck like a Doberman mouth
With like 40 m*** out the covenant house, ya heard?

Gilla house in the circuit
And how we do it on purpose, only way to surface
Def Squad is the foundation
Three dawgs attached to 98 Dalmatians

Yeah, where them gilla niggaz out at night
You better run 'til you see the light, light
Yo, I know I had you waitin'
But death was chasin' me and my eight friends for Final Destination

Ooh, shoulda knew that we gon' bring that funk to you
(Yeah, yeah, yo E-Dub, this is hot nigga)
Gilla house, is comin' through and Wutchoogonnado

Okay now, take off your shirt and relax
Let all your tensions out, just relax, just relax, just relax
(Gilla, gilla, gilla, gilla, gilla, gilla, gilla, gilla)

Yo, I keep my ears to the street 'cause that's my job
But even the streets can steer you wrong
I'm walkin' with one man above me
Nuttin' on my waist, but if it's on you hearin' the palm

You forgot I'm ten years deep and out them ten years
I got two weeks of sleep and caffeine free
Amazin' right? I got a street team
That'll get paid to snipe

Yeah, by any means, I'm behind the curtain
My Betty Shabazz, hope I make it home, I invade alone
Catch you in the truck, babblin' on the phone
I miss you, I stick up your chaperone's

It's a dirty dog world, say it louder
Every Friday I'm bein' chased by Craig's father
That's why I'm on the low like pro
And my file is too hi tech to call next

I got a heart the size of John Q's son
And on the mic, I'm him times two of 'em
Y'all n*** get your s*** together
'Cause gilla house n***, prepare for whatever

You, you shoulda knew that we gon' bring
Got to bring that funk to you, to you
That gilla house is comin' through
And what you b*** a*** n*** gonna do, do, do, do, do, ohh, ohh

You and you and you, you shoulda knew
That we got to bring that funk to you, you, you

Yeah I laugh when I'm yakkin to children
But it's hard when ya boy lackin a million

Makin' my episode of life another sequel
I like flyin' on Delta and Continental
First class, playin' them elevator instrumentals
I'm in the window, got on my headphones
Listenin' to Big Pun and Wyclef Jean
It's like Exxon, I get gassed up
I shuffle 'round the board like Cassius
That's us when the plane land, hey man
It ain't hard cause I can do it like a caveman
Fix my Ray-Bans, I hit the hotel
Do my show, get my money, hit the hotel
Sittin' at the hotel like ""Oh well!""
I call shorty that I met today at Modell's
Go girl, it's like we in The Matrix

If it's a high life you seekin' then you say it
Cause how the hell you gonna win the game if you ain't playin'?
I'm in Monaco, swimmin' in the deep end with 3 dimes, this ain't dominos
Well maybe it was, I set 'em up to knock 'em down and go
The skeletons in the closet, I'm makin a new deposit
She was never so erotic 'til we got to the ex-o-tic-tic, now I'm thinkin'
that this time bomb is about to explode
Got me wishin' that it was different than money, contradiction is funny
I just told y'all to play the game if y'all wan' eat
The truth is it's what you make it
That's why I got my baby girl naked
Long before I bought them tickets to Turks and Caicos
We love each other, beyond under covers
That's why I'm feelin' so high like them Wright brothers
Fly, I hope it never take material

made bein President one tough act to follow

to bring back originality, style and concept
Show you how to write 16's with context
Mix it with a little Lil Wayne and KRS
That's fresh! Dummy, study the art
Study how it all began and see the part
Study how Kool Herc became King of Bronx
Learn, how to rock Wallabees and Clarks
I think I found hip-hop dawg, she right here

Rednex,"- The McKenzie brothers just reached their limits. It's now mid-August and two months have passed since the new marshall Mike Monroe came to town. He'd already put Joe and Jeramiha six feet under. 
They were drunk as the skunks, they were on their way back from the saloon. They passed Steve Harlow's range to wrestle some cattle. The marshall and his deputies showed up and shot 'em in the neck. The most bloody fireworks Dog Head City had ever seen. Jim, the oldest brother and head of the clan since father Judas got his head blown of in a gunfight, saddled up his horse and went in to town, just to set things straight with the marshall. On his way to town he rode past his uncle Jock's to fill him in about Joe and Jeramiha. 
""Looks like the marshall wants a war and he's gonna get one"", Jock said. ""I'll send a message out for brother James, your uncle. Remember him? You met at the wedding when he stole your cousin Julia from the groom."" Meanwhile, in town, marshall Monroe and his deputies were drinking their heads off and shootin' run away chickens to celebrate the passing of the McKenzies. 
Next morning, the McKenzie clan were ready to set things straight with the marshall and his men. They sent little John into town to lure 'em out and into a trap, so they can shoot 'em dead. 
John came to town, walked into the saloon, saw the marshall eatin' lunch. Baked beans, sollie belly and a tun of brew. He saw his chance to be a man, he'd always been a little boy in the clan. He wiped his sweat of his hands and said: ""Hey scumbag, this town ain't big enough for the two of us. You killed my two brothers and now, it's your time to kiss the dust. Get ready to slap leather."" 
But before John even cleared his holster, the marshall had filled him with so much lead, it took six strong men to carry him out. Mike Monroe finished his meal, reloaded his gun, gathered his men and said: ""It's time to finish the McKenzies, once and for all."" 

The McKenzie brothers 
May Hell be your home 
The McKenzie brothers 
The end of your terrordome 

The McKenzie brothers 
May Hell be your home

After the final battle, 
two miles north of Dog Head City, 
just where the river breaks up 
in to thoose beautiful cascades 
before it melts in to Rickies Lake, 
the McKenzie Brothers just 
captured the town. 

They went to a saloon near the court, 
several pigs and chickens 
where occupeing the floor, 
and what some dirty men did....
well, I'll leave that for others to tell. 

Gouvernant Brunte and his wife Labradora-Beth
placed on stools hanging on the bar 
trying to avoid the brothers 
by looking in another direction. 

Among the other places they took care of 
- to say the least, were the bank, 
the library which was burned down, 
and the jailhouse was left in ruins. 

The very next day 
a telegram reaches the lokal post office. 
It said: the U.S Cavalery is moving south 
to solve the problem with the McKenzie klan.
Bountyhunters where now seen all over the town.
After having read the telegram 
Jack gathered the McKenzie klan. 

Next destination: The cathouse in El Paso, 
we better split town immediately. 
They got to cross the Mexican border. 
That is their only chance to survive.

Rednex,"The devil went down to Georgia
He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind 'cause he was way behind
And willing to make a deal

When he came across one young man
Sawing on a fiddle and playing it hot
And the devil jumped up on a hickory stump
And said, ""Boy, let me tell you what""

""I bet you didn't know it
But I'm a fiddle player too
And if you'd care to take a dare
I'll make a bet with you""

""Now you play pretty good fiddle, boy
But I'll give the devil his due
I bet a fiddle of gold against your soul
I think I'm better than you""

The boy said, ""My name's Johnny
And it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet, you're gonna regret
I'm the best that's ever been""

Johnny you rosin up your bow
And play your fiddle hard
'Cause Hell's broke loose in Georgia
And the devil deals the cards

And if you win
You get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose
The devil gets your soul

The devil opened up his case
And he said, ""I'll start this show""
And fire flew from his fingertips
As he rosined up his bow

And he pulled the bow across the strings
It made an evil hiss
Then a band of demons joined in
And it sounded something like this

When the devil finished, Johnny said
""You're pretty good, old son
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done""

Fire on the mountain, run, boys, run
Devil's in the house of the rising sun
Chicken in the bread pan, pickin' out dough
Granny does your dog bite, no, child, no

The best that's ever been
I'm the best that's ever been

The devil bowed his head
Because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle
On the ground at Johnny's feet

Johnny said, ""Devil, come on back
If you ever want to try again
I told you once, you son of a bitch
I'm the best that's ever been""

Fire on the mountain, run, boys, run
Devil's in the house of the rising sun
Chicken in the bread pan, pickin' out dough
Granny does your dog bite, no, child, no

Else take a closer look you'll see she's in a world of
Loneliness and in the club everybody knows her well'
But deep inside she knows she can't call them friends
She wanna get her party on but she's broke again
Surround herself with older men, they know what she's
Offering she bring them home, next morning she's alone
Again she swear to the mirror never to do coke again
Trying to fight the tears, she can't hold them in
Trying to fight the fear, but she knows she won't win

Dreamt about dancing when she was young had a passion
For acting when she was young she made plans about
Traveling around the globe only place she dance now is
Round a pole and as the night's getting colder now

Redshell,"""Her blackness is fine, the blackness of her skin the blackness of her mind"" 
Her beauty cannot be measured with standards of a colonized mind
Darker than blue darker than her blackness 
Unblemished her features broad and striking 
She cradles his body with her large hands 
Her fingers stretch endlessly into his world of pain 
Her caresses warm and penetrating she loves the black boy 
His existence predestined to be one of no remorse compassion 
Or the delusion of equality 
But the love he gives (a doxology for her) 
He praises and cares for what he can never be
There's such purity in a love that is essential to the loving of one's self",[Untitled Track]

Lookin' in windows at things I couldn't want 
There's johnson's hardware and morgans jewelry
And the ol' Lee king's apothecary
They ware the little man

I go back now and the stores are all empty
Except for an old coke sign from 1950
Boarded up like they never existed
Or renovated and called historic districts
There goes the little man

Now the court square's just a set of streets
That the people go round but they seldom think
Bout the little man that built this town
Before the big money shut em down
And killed the little man
Oh the little man

He pumped your gas and he cleaned your glass
And one cold rainy night he fixed your flat
The new stores came where you do it yourself
You buy a lotto ticket and food off the shelf
Forget about the little man
Forget about that little man

He hung on there for a few more years
But he couldn't sell slurpees
And he wouldn't sell beer
Now the bank rents the station
To a down the road
And sell velvet Elvis and
Second-hand clothes
There goes little man
There goes another little man

Now the are lined up in a concrete strip
You can buy the world with just one trip
And save a penny cause it's jumbo size
They don't even realize
They'er killin' the little man

An airline ticket to romantic places

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings

The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

Fly away with me on a jet plane

I don't want to close my eyes
Even though I'm tired I do not want to sleep
I'm going on a trip when I've saved money
I'm so excited

up to you how far see how brave you are
End up in baja on the peninsula
You could take a chance
In the south of france
Maybe hosseger on a ferry

I don't want to close my eyes
Even though I'm tired I do not want to sleep
I'm going on a trip when I've saved money
I'm so excited

Easter for ?00
Holidays all of the 'round
Sweet kernow I am coming down

don't you want to go don't you want to go
Come away with me because I'm leaving

I see my future that way

I end up chasing a whole year at a time
I found a new rhythm I brought me near
And made that feeling disappear

Bring it on bring it on bring it on
Because it's not that far away
Won't you bring it on for me

I tore my mind on a jagged sky
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in

Yeah, yeah, oh yeah, what condition my condition was in?

I pushed my soul into a deep dark hole and then I followed it in
I watched myself crawlin' out as I was a-crawlin' in
I got up so tight I couldn't unwind
I smoked so much I broke my mind

High school seemed like such a blur,
I didn't have much interest in sports or school elections.
And in class I dreamed all day,
Of a rock 'n' roll weekend

And the girl in the front of the room,
So close yet so far ya know she never seemed to notice
That this silly schoolboy crush
Wasn't just pretend.

Life goes by so fast
You only want to do what you think is right.
Close your eyes and then it's past
Story of my life

And I went down my old neighborhood
The faces have all changed there's no one left to talk to
And the pool hall I loved as a kid
Is now a Seven Eleven

I went downtown to look for a job
I had no training, no experience to speak of.
I looked at the holes in my jeans
And turned and headed back.

Good times come and good times go,
I only wish the good times would last a little longer.
I think about the good times we had
And why they had to end.

I strum my guitar and I sing an outlaw love song.

And when you're comin' back.

When that river stops flowin', she's burning up the telephone
By the time that I find you, my money's all down the drain

Somewhere, somehow there's a bigger scar

Who the fuck are we to separate and support their actions of hate?
Knowledge is the key to unlock the mind, the imperialistic system
That invented prejudice and misbelief, they still benefit from it
They still do as they please, inject us with reasons of contemplation
And dissatisfaction to assure that

We remain sedated to their segregative actions
In our years of existence, has our modern society
Gotten any closer to equality where people openly are being oppressed
Because of color, religion, gender, class, sexual preference?

ReGenesis,"Play me old King Cole 
That I may join with you 
All your hearts now seem so far from me 
It hardly seems to matter now

And the nurse will tell you lies 
Of a kingdom beyond the skies
But I am lost within this half-world
It hardly seems to matter now

Old King Cole was a merry old soul
And a merry old soul was he 
So he called for his pipe 
And he called for his bowl
And he called for his fiddlers three

And I want, and I feel, and I know, and I touch

ReGenesis,"Turn and run! 
Nothing can stop them, 
Around every river and canal their power is growing. 
Stamp them out! 
We must destroy them, 
They infiltrate each city with their thick dark warning odour. 

They are invincible, 
They seem immune to all our herbicidal battering. 

Long ago in the russian hills, 
A victorian explorer found the regal hogweed by a marsh, 
He captured it and brought it home. 
Botanical creature stirs, seeking revenge. 
Royal beast did not forget. 
He came home to london, 
And made a present of the hogweed to the royal gardens at kew. 

Waste no time! 
They are approaching. 
Hurry now, we must protect ourselves and find some shelter 
Strike by night! 
They are defenceless. 
They all need the sun to photosensitize their venom. 

Still they're invincible, 
Still they're immune to all our herbicidal battering. 

Fashionable country gentlemen had some cultivated wild gardens, 
In which they innocently planted the giant hogweed throughout the land. 
Botanical creature stirs, seeking revenge. 
Royal beast did not forget. 
Soon they escaped, spreading their seed, 
Preparing for an onslaught, threatening the human race. 

Mighty hogweed is avenged. 
Human bodies soon will know our anger. 
Kill them with your hogweed hairs

ReGenesis,"The path is clear
Though no eyes can see
The course laid down long before.
And so with gods and men
The sheep remain inside their pen,
Though many times they've seen the way to leave.

He rides majestic
Past homes of men
Who care not or gaze with joy,
To see reflected there
The trees, the sky, the lily fair,
The scene of death is lying just below.

The mountain cuts off the town from view,
Like a cancer growth is removed by skill.
Let it be revealed.
A waterfall, his madrigal.
An inland sea, his symphony.

Undinal songs
Urge the sailors on
Till lured by sirens cry.

Now as the river dissolves in sea,
So Neptune has claimed another soul.
And so with gods and men
The sheep remain inside their pen,
Until the shepherd leads his flock away.

The sands of time were eroded by
The river of constant change.",Firth of Fifth
ReGenesis,"Walking across the sitting-room, I turn the television off. 
Sitting beside you, I look into your eyes. 
As the sound of motor cars fades in the night time, 
I swear I saw your face change, it didn't seem quite right. 
...And it's hello babe with your guardian eyes so blue 
Hey my baby don't you know our love is true. 

Coming closer with our eyes, a distance falls around our bodies. 
Out in the garden, the moon seems very bright, 
Six saintly shrouded men move across the lawn slowly. 
The seventh walks in front with a cross held high in hand. 
...And it's hey babe your supper's waiting for you. 
Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true. 

I've been so far from here, 
Far from your warm arms. 
It's good to feel you again, 
It's been a long long time. Hasn't it? 

I know a farmer who looks after the farm. 
With water clear, he cares for all his harvest. 
I know a fireman who looks after the fire. 

You, can't you see he's fooled you all. 
Yes, he's here again, can't you see he's fooled you all. 
Share his peace, 
Sign the lease. 
He's a supersonic scientist, 
He's the guaranteed eternal sanctuary man. 
Look, look into my mouth he cries, 
And all the children lost down many paths, 
I bet my life you'll walk inside 
Hand in hand, 
gland in gland 
With a spoonful of miracle, 
He's the guaranteed eternal sanctuary man. 
We will rock you, rock you little snake, 
We will keep you snug and warm. 

Wearing feelings on our faces while our faces took a rest, 
We walked across the fields to see the children of the West, 
But we saw a host of dark skinned warriors 
standing still below the ground, 
Waiting for battle. 

The fight's begun, they've been released. 
Killing foe for peace...bang, bang, bang. Bang, bang, bang... 
And they're giving me a wonderful potion, 
'cause I cannot contain my emotion. 
And even though I'm feeling good, 
Something tells me I'd better activate my prayer capsule. 

Today's a day to celebrate, the foe have met their fate. 
The order for rejoicing and dancing has come from our warlord. 

Wandering through the chaos the battle has left, 
We climb up a mountain of human flesh, 
To a plateau of green grass, and green trees full of life. 
A young figure sits still by a pool, 
He's been stamped ""Human Bacon"" by some butchery tool. 
(He is you) 
Social Security took care of this lad. 
We watch in reverence, as Narcissus is turned to a flower. 

A flower? 

If you go down to Willow Farm, 
to look for butterflies, flutterbyes, gutterflies 
Open your eyes, it's full of surprise, everyone lies, 
like the focks on the rocks, 
and the musical box. 
Oh, there's Mum & Dad, and good and bad, 
and everyone's happy to be here. 

There's Winston Churchill dressed in drag, 
he used to be a British flag, plastic bag, what a drag. 
The frog was a prince, the prince was a brick, the brick was an egg, 
the egg was a bird. 
(Fly away you sweet little thing, they're hard on your tail) 
Hadn't you heard? 
(They're going to change you into a human being!) 
Yes, we're happy as fish and gorgeous as geese, 
and wonderfully clean in the morning. 

We've got everything, we're growing everything, 
We've got some in 
We've got some out 
We've got some wild things floating about 
Everyone, we're changing everyone, 
you name them all, 
We've had them here, 
And the real stars are still to appear. 

ALL CHANGE! 

Feel your body melt; 
Mum to mud to mad to dad 
Dad diddley office, Dad diddley office, 
You're all full of ball. 

Dad to dam to dumb to mum 
Mum diddley washing, Mum diddley washing, 
You're all full of ball. 

Let me hear you lies, we're living this up to the eyes. 
Ooee-ooee-ooee-oowaa 
Momma I want you now. 

And as you listen to my voice 
To look for hidden doors, tidy floors, more applause. 
You've been here all the time, 
Like it or not, like what you got, 
You're under the soil (the soil, the soil), 
Yes, deep in the soil (the soil, the soil, the soil!). 
So we'll end with a whistle and end with a bang 
and all of us fit in our places. 

With the guards of Magog, swarming around, 
The Pied Piper takes his children underground. 
Dragons coming out of the sea, 
Shimmering silver head of wisdom looking at me. 
He brings down the fire from the skies, 
You can tell he's doing well by the look in human eyes. 
Better not compromise. 
It won't be easy. 

666 is no longer alone, 
He's getting out the marrow in your back bone, 
And the seven trumpets blowing sweet rock and roll, 
Gonna blow right down inside your soul. 
Pythagoras with the looking glass reflects the full moon, 
In blood, he's writing the lyrics of a brand new tune. 

And it's hey babe, with your guardian eyes so blue, 
Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true, 
I've been so far from here, 
Far from your loving arms, 
Now I'm back again, and babe it's gonna work out fine. 

Can't you feel our souls ignite 
Shedding ever changing colours, 
in the darkness of the fading night, 
Like the river joins the ocean, 
as the germ in a seed grows 
We have finally been freed to get back home. 

There's an angel standing in the sun, 
and he's crying with a loud voice,

Has life again destroyed life, 
Do they play elsewhere, do they know 
More than their childhood games? 
Maybe the lizard's shed its tail, 
This is the end of man's long union with Earth. 

Judge not this race by empty remains 
Do you judge God by his creatures when they are dead? 
For now, the lizard's shed it's tail 
This is the end of man's long union with Earth.

I was jammin'
Jammin' for the first time

Jammin', jammin'
Jammin' for the first time
Jammin', jammin'
Jammin' for the first time

I was a girl from the streets
Dancin' to the beat
Of a different kind of drummer
Little Ms. Know-it-all, you don't know it all

Caught up in the rhythm of sound
Living to get down
As the song became my lover
Attitude keeps your head up to the sky

Then you kissed my lips and, ooh
I lost my cool

Look at me I'm jammin'
And everything's happenin'
I'm feeling the bliss and the reason for this
Is the love in your kiss, baby
Jammin'

Jammin', jammin'
Jammin' for the first time
Jammin', jammin'
Jammin' for the first time

I was like a moving violation
Give me a ticket, baby
Thought I was the queen of syncopation
You know you can't give the queen no bad advice

Thought I knew it all, baby
But I didn't know it all, baby
Thought I knew it all, baby
But I didn't know it all, baby

?Cause when you kissed my lips
And my backbone slipped
I was jammin'
Jammin' for the first time

The square root of a positive groove
Times a happening melody equals a jam
Give some to the back

No
Ooh, baby
No
You got me movin' and I'm jammin' for the first time

No
Ooh, baby
No
You got me movin' and I'm jammin' for the first time

I was like a moving violation
Give me a ticket, baby
Thought I was the queen of syncopation
You know you can't give the queen no bad advice

Reggie Paul,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

Oh my heart 
Changing the way I kill 
By changing the way I feel 
Step forward 

Everybody , around the world understands 
What makes a child of man ( yes come ) 

[Chorus]

Feel like I want to be you more than I 
Get around come around 
See you everynight hear the crowd the sound of violence 
Shake it out 

Ready now 
Going to let it all out 
Ready now 
When the sun goes down 
We'll be coming out ready or not 

Feel like a want to be inside of you 
When the sun goes down 
As long as I'm gonna be around you

Regi,"I am sitting
In the morning
At the diner
On the corner

I am waiting
At the counter
For the man
To pour the coffee

And he fills it
Only halfway
And before
I even argue

He is looking
Out the window
At somebody
Coming in

""It is always
Nice to see you""
Says the man
Behind the counter

To the woman
Who has come in
She is shaking
Her umbrella

And I look
The other way
As they are kissing
Their hellos

I'm pretending
Not to see them
And Instead
I pour the milk

I open
Up the paper
There's a story
Of an actor

Who had died
While he was drinking
He was no one
I had heard of

And I'm turning
To the horoscope
And looking
For the funnies

When I'm feeling
Someone watching me
And so
I raise my head

There's a woman
On the outside
Looking inside
Does she see me?

No she does not
Really see me
Cause she sees
Her own reflection

And I'm trying
Not to notice
That she's hitching
Up her skirt

And while she's
Straightening her stockings
Her hair
Is getting wet

Oh, this rain
It will continue
Through the morning
As I'm listening

To the bells
Of the cathedral
I am thinking
Of your voice...

And of the midnight picnic
Once upon a time
Before the rain began...

I finish up my coffee
It's time to catch the train",Tom's Diner

I will endure, all the time
Hold together in the worst conditions
For at birth, we knew it to be, one of a kind

And as it grew into this love of a legend
We both made sure this piece of heaven
Would withstand any test
For the strength was made of love, faith and trust

And until all the glitter's gone
We'll be adding on to make it even stronger
True love will never die
Long after the love has lost it's shine

After it's all tired and worn
And the newness all wears off
We'll still be lovers

'Cause every time a weak spot
Would appear in this affair
We'd be mending it back together
With tender loving care
A promise to each other
That's lasted through the years
Is it solid as the first time
'Cause it's still alive and well

And until all the glitter's gone
We'll be adding on to make it even stronger
True love will never die
Long after the love has lost it's shine

Painting pictures on the window pane
Feelings my heart cannot explain
Oh the silence sounds like music

Seems like I can hear a melody
Baby that's what you do to me
One thing I'm sure of whether it's wrong or it's right
I only want to be with you tonight
And if you want me to baby ask me to stay
Heaven's just a whisper away

Feel the magic taking over
Please don't stop before we lose control
Baby just let your feeling go let it go now
Soft and tender like the morning
We get closer than we've ever been
We're almost to the rainbow's end

One thing I'm sure of whether it's wrong or it's right
I only want to be with you tonight
And if you want me to baby ask me to stay
Heaven's just a whisper away Heaven's just a whisper away

And I heard the winds of forever
Calling out my name
And it's paradise when I'm with you
I'll never be the same

Please don't wake me if I'm dreaming
'Cause this time this one is coming true
So nice to share my dreams with you

One thing I'm sure of whether it's wrong or it's right
I only want to be with you tonight

Regina Belle,"It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say 
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For what ever my man is 
I am his forever more",My Man
Regina Belle,"Since I met you I've begun to feel so strange
Every time I speak your name (that's funny)
You say that you are so helpless too
That you don't know what to do
 
Each night I pray there will never come a day
When you up and take your love away
Say you feel the same way too and I wonder what
It is I feel for you
 
Could it be I'm falling in love (witcha baby)
Could it be I'm falling in love (ooh)
Could it be I'm falling in love
With you, with you  with you, with you
 
I don't need all those things that used to bring me joy
You made me such a happy boy
And honey you'll always be the only one for me
Meeting you was my destiny
You can be sure I will never let you down
When you need me I will be around
And darling you'll always be the only one for me
Heaven made you specially

Regina Belle,"It's knowin' that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up
And stashed behind your couch

And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or somethin' that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'

It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
And the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup
Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughenin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're wavin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind",Someday We'll All Be Free/Save the Children

If I dim a light
Since the fire's bright
What are you afraid of?

Who's to know you let yourself go
A kiss or so astray
High, oh the merrier
Blame it on the stereo all the way

Baby, take your shoes off
We're not going dancing
Kiss me like before, let the fire roar
Throw another pillow on the floor
Learn what love is made of
What are you afraid of?

High, oh the merrier
Blame it on the stereo all the way

Baby, take your shoes off
We're not going dancing
Kiss me like before, let the fire roar
Throw another pillow on the floor
Learn what love is made of
What are you afraid of?

Now the gang is gone

Regina Belle,"Now turn your back on things of the world 
Let's have our victory through Jesus 
Trust in the Lord with all your heart 
In all your ways acknowledge Him 
And He shall make your paths straight 
If any man be in Christ he is new 

[Chorus]
We, we have the victory through Jesus 
We, we have the victory through Jesus 
Let's stand and proclaim His name 
Throughout the earth 
Throughout the earth 

There is a way that seems right unto a man 
But it will end in death I say 
The way I walk is chosen by the Lord 
And He shall give His angels charge 
To watch over you 
If any man he take in Christ he is new 

[Chorus]",Victory
Regina Carter,"Captured effortlessly
That's the way it was
Happened so naturally
I did not know it was love
The next thing I felt was
You holding me close
What was I gonna do?
I let myself go

And now we're flyin' through the star
I hope this night will last forever

I've been waitin' for you
It's been so long
I knew just what I would do
When I heard your song
Filled my heart with your bliss
Gave me freedom
You knew I could not resist
I needed someone

And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever
Oh oh oh oh

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you

I wait for night time to come
And bring you to me
Can't believe I'm the one
I was so lonely
I feel like no one could feel
I must be dreamin'
I want this dream to be real
I need this feelin'

I make my wish upon a star
And hope this night will last forever

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you

And first you put your arms around me
Then you put your charms around me
I can't resist this sweet surrender
Oh my nights are warm and tender
We stare into each other's eyes
And what we see is no surprise
Got a feeling most with treasure
And a love so deep we cannot measure

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you",Ain't Nobody
Regina Carter,"I thirst but never quench
I know the consequence, feeling as I do
We're in a spinning top
where, tell me, will it stop
and what am I to say
Open our music book, that only few can look
and I'll write a song for you

Love is a symphony, hearts in one melody
'Cause I write a song for you
Sounds never dissipate, they only recreate
in another place
There in your silent night
joy of a song's delight
I write a song for you
You write a song for me
We write a song for love

My magical mystique, finding it all complete
in a lovely face, feeling we try to chase
memories that won't erase, stay forever new
We have a magic box in which is never locked",I'll Write a Song for You
Regina Carter,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 

Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 
Oh lady be good to me.","Oh, Lady Be Good"
Regina Carter,"It was the third of September; that day I'll always remember, 
'Cause that was the day that my daddy died.
I never got a chance to see him; never heard nothin' but bad things about him.
Mama I'm depending on you to tell me the truth.

Mama just looked at him and said, ""Son, 
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.""
 
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.""
 
Hey, Mama, is it true what the say, that Papa never worked a day in his life?
And Mama, they talk all around town say that 
Papa had three outside children and another wife 
And that ain't right.
Heard them talkin' about Papa doing some storefront preachin'
Talkin' about saving your souls and all the time weak, dealin' in death
And stealin' in the name of the Lord
Mama just hung her head and said,
 
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.""
 
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.""
 
Hey, Mama, I heard Papa call himself a jack of all trades.
Tell me, is that what sent Papa to an early grave?
Folks say Papa would beg; borrow or steal to pay his bills.
Hey, Mama, folks say Papa was never much on thinkin';
Spend most of his time chasin' women and drinkin'!
Mama, I'm depending on you to tell me the truth.

Mama just hung her head and said, ""Son,
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.""
 
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.

Regina Carter,"Pardon me boy, is that the Chattanooga Choo Choo?
Track twenty nine, boy you can gimme a shine
I can afford to board a Chattanooga Choo Choo
I've got my fare and just a trifle to spare
 
You leave the Pennsylvania station 'bout a quarter to four
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore
Dinner in the diner, nothing could be finer
Than to have your ham 'n' eggs in Carolina
 
When you hear the whistle blowin' eight to the bar
Then you know that Tennessee is not very far
Shovel all the coal in, gotta keep it rollin'
Woo, woo, Chattanooga, there you are
 
There's gonna be a certain party at the station
Satin and lace, I used to call funny face
She's gonna cry until I tell her that I'll never roam",Chattanooga Choo Choo
Regina Carter,"Of all the boys I've known, and I've known some
Until I first met you, I was lonesome
And when you came in sight, dear, my heart grew light
And this old world seemed new to me

You're really swell, I have to admit you
Deserve expressions that really fit you
And so I've racked my brain, hoping to explain
All the things that you do to me

Bei mir bist do schon, please let me explain
Bei mir bist do schon means you're grand
Bei mir bist do schon, again I'll explain
It means you're the fairest in the land

I could say ""Bella, bella"", even ""sehr wunderbar""
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are

I've tried to explain, bei mir bist do schon
So kiss me and say you understand

Bei mir bist do schon, you've heard it all before
 but let me try to explain
Bei mir bist do schon means that you're grand
Bei mir bist do schon, it's such an old refrain
 and yet I should explain
It means I am begging for your hand

I could say ""Bella, bella"", even ""sehr wunderbar""
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are

Regina Carter,"I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, 
The chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning' sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you
I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you",I'll Be Seeing You
Regina Carter,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues
Regina Carter,"I'd like to get away, Junior
Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior
You need a laugh
Or two

A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""
We'll thank the small hotel
Together

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel
Regina Carter,"This can't be love
Because I feel so well
No sobs, no sorrows, no sighs
This can't be love

I get no dizzy spells
My head is not in the skies
My heart does not stand still
Just hear it beat

This is too sweet to be love

Regina Carter,"When a girl has the heart of a mother
It must go to someone of course
It can't be sister or brother
And so I love my horse
But horses are frequently silly
Mine ran from the beach of Okhala
And left me alone for a filly
So I have picked you up

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will, you've made your kill
Cause you took advantage of me
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me.
