Sponge,"If you see Mary please will you help her
She seems to be looking for answers
If you see Mary please will you help her
with questions that go unanswered

Like why does she feel all dead on the inside
But as a child she remembers feeling alive
who was that man that made 
my mother cry all night
was that my father who was my father

If you see Mary please will you help her
She seems to be looking for answers
If you see Mary please will you help her
with questions that go unanswered

The men that walked into her life
are no different than all the others
that promise the world and then they leave her
She says I should have known better,
I should have known better

Will she always feel so all alone
Why was there never a man in her home
and will I end up like my mother
by myself with no other
with no other

If you see Mary please will you help her
She seems to be looking for answers
If you see Mary please will you help her
with questions that go unanswered
",Have You Seen Mary
Sponge,"I found your name in a book and in
That book a letter, were the words of
A girl who said that she was lead away and
Left for dead but somehow she survived it

How was it no one would believe that
You were part of their world a different world
One they denied you
If I could help you I would
Help you now you can speak through me
I am Anastasia

I'm haunted by a girl whose
Life's locked in these pages 
But through these works she will be free through
Me I know we won't forget her
She can speak through me
I am Anastasia",I Am Anastasia
Sponge,"She was a waitress but convinced
She had been a dead movie star
Reincarnated to live the live of a queen
But the real scars she was nursing
Were not from her man but from 
Her beast of burden because in real life
She could not live her dreams

All day long he drove a cab
For 30 years he was the man 
Take you anywhere that you pleased
And for 30 years he was amazed 
He took care of his wife and her bad legs,

He thought he lived a life like a machine
And he hoped he could have been the 
Drummer man in some great big band
That would drive the world wild with his beat

(And oh yeah)
Baby said that
She always been a dreamer
She ain't scared with her hands up in the air
She shows the world she's a super star
Can't you see

Are stars made or are they born
She's glamorous but so unknown 
And she's always so well received
And easy to love and easy to please
Baby said that
She always been a dreamer.",My Baby Said
Sponge,"If I was dirt
That filled up your life
If I was dirt
So pure and so refined
I'd be the dirt that
Blackened all that shined

[Chorus:]
Which one would show a purity
Which ane would show how curious
This purity has been
My purity, My purity
My thoroughness, My purity

If I was dirt
That would make you lie
Could I be the dirt
In your irreverent smile
Please pass the dirt 
I'll have some on mine

[Chorus]

Drag me down and plough me
Under nothing stays the same
Drag me down and plough me
Under nothing will ever change?

If I was the dirt you brought
Through your doorstep
And did that dirt Leave you
Feeling molested
How was that dirt that you've
Ingested

[Chorus]",My Purity
Sponge,"We, we can do anything
Why do they beat us down with their lies.
They object us they reject us
Time after time then we ask ourselves

Why are we alive
I can't hear anything
They make silence their drug

We, we are everything 
Why do they beat us down to their size
The better we fit, the bigger
They get and we justify their
Lousy existance.

Why are we alive
I can't hear anything
They make silence their drug",Silence Is Their Drug

Like a problem hair you pluck or shave?
But shaving got to be such a bore
And you deserve so much more
And happiness is just a purchase away

[Chorus:]
Angelina it'll fix your hunchback
Angelina it'll help your time pass
Angelina here's a forcast
Angelina it's science we never laugh
Here's something that is automatic
It's wax ecstatic
When life is nothing less than tragic
It's wax ecstatic
When life has lost all it's magic
It's wax ecstatic
When life can't promise the fantastic
It's wax ecstatic

Throw all your troubles away
You'll nothing left that you want to save
With this circus you'll need nothing more
And all your troubles walk out the door
And it's all just a phone call away

Sponge,"Hey okay it's just another day
24 useless hours
What difference does it make
If your heart ain't changed
Things will be okay
If you'll be mine
Hey okay on a different day
Just the two of us stranded
In our own spaces
If this love is fate
True love always waits
And I know
Hope you'll be
I hope you'll be
I hope you'll be mine
1,000 times that's my lover's promise
1,000 times that love is here to stay
True love always waits
And I know
Hope you'll be
I hope you'll be
I hope you'll be mine
In my dreams that's where I'll meet you
Reaching out to stars above you
Call my name I will come to you
I can send my message to you
Eternally soul-to-soul
Hey okay nothing takes your place
But the world gets colder
Feelings don't fade
But you're so far away
And I'm feelings don't fade
But you're so far away
And I'm praying for the day
1,000 times that's my lover's promise
1,000 times that love is here to stay
True love always waits
And I know I hope you'll be
I hope you'll be
I hope you'll be
I hope you'll be mine

When it seems
That you're a fish

Looking for
The All American world
Lots of us are looking
Some die trying
If life's so beautiful
Why do I feel like crying

What you're compromising
When you feel your blood
Pressure rising
All American noise
Looking for the All American world

You've used up your last chance
You'd sell your soul
In this pulp romance
But you can't sell a thing
You already gave away

There ain't no denying
Things are looking good
As long as we keep buying

Is there enough for me?

I really found out I was my one and only killer
My one and only killer

Sponge,"Take my lips and sew them shut
Without words I'll dry up and blow away
She said that we were both so out of touch
And when we talked we'd say things
That don't mean anything
I hear your voice but you're so far away

I can do without these things
But what I can't do
Is live here without you
Live here without you
Live here without you

I can't kiss you anymore
I can't miss you anymore
Love's not easy to ignore
When your heart likes bleeding on the floor
I'll just sit and count the days
The days until you'll be mine

I'll take in air and I'll fill it up
Never breathing out I'll burst in flames
Without you I can never get enough
Of the thing that makes me feel like
Life's worth anything
I feel your touch at the thought of your name

I can do without these things
But what I can't do
Is live here without you
Live here without you
Live here without you

I can't kiss you anymore
I can't miss you anymore
Love's not easy to ignore
When your heart likes bleeding on the floor
I'll just sit and count the days
The days until you'll be mine

I don't want anything 
Like a Jesus or a Superman
I don't want for anything
If you could be here with me again

I can do without these things
But what I can't do
Is live here without you
Live here without you
Live here without you

I can't kiss you anymore
I can't miss you anymore
Love's not easy to ignore
When your heart likes bleeding on the floor
I'll just sit and count the days
The days until you'll be mine

I just can't live here anymore

Sponge,"This little penny is to dream on
To make all your wishes come true
Hip hip hooray
I'm in my big black holiday
No bulls died today
To a very unappreciative earth and sky
The land is recoiled
Asking as if it had said why
My ship leaves today
And I'm safely lowered away
Guess who I walked into
Guess who walked right up to say
A bloody nose and a bloody knife
Now I've disposed of my routine life
All seemed to implore seconds more
Give me more of this sublime night

Sponge,"Hey my lackluster love
You are my one and only drug
I'll give you anything at all
Even though it might be pain
Relax killer you're a god
Everything fits so damn hard
Let's sit and enjoy the pain
They say we should feel so ashamed
But we know better
But we know better
Let's sing together
La la la
A demolition's going on
You complete me my A-bomb
You're like a needle in the arm
Every minute every day
You're my unit, you're the one
You're so space age when you come
Let's sit and enjoy the pain
They say we should feel so ashamed
But we know better
But we know better
Let's sleep together

You are my one and only drug

Sponge,"Well she was
Clearly nervous
She asked me if I would drive
And I noticed
Then I knew
She had been drinking
And I always could
Read between the lines
There she was
Clearly nervous
Because there was something
That I had neglected
I was obvious
She could see right through me
Then we made love, ya we made love
So unprotected
Now here we are

It? a New Pop Sunday
We went too far
And now you?e gone
The brightest star
On my darkest Monday
Now here we are
It? a New Pop Sunday

Well she was
Clearly nervous
And I noticed she had
Something on her mind
But I was cool
Yeah I was cool
I knew what was coming
But doctors ain? really
Hard to find
Now here we are

It? a New Pop Sunday
We went too far
And now you?e gone
The brightest star
On my darkest Monday
Now here we are
Forever gone

You make my satellites whirl
You shake up my world

In a trap set long ago so life freely spills
You seem to feel you know where they are
You think you see them on your radar

For friendly old times
To see me
How long can you stay
Did you bring your disease
That makes me breathe

Is I keep your picture around me

Send light to Polyanna
Find God for Polyanna in me
I'll find God for Polyanna
New life for Polyanna
So Polyanna don't feel my misery
She don't feel my misery
Here I am again
Left for dead again
Oh how sweet
Come back any day
Anytime is okay to see me
What's left of me
What you don't know
Is I keep your vision around me
Your addiction surrounds me
It lets you know the power you have over me
Over me
I'll find God for Polyanna
Send light to Polyanna
Find God for Polyanna in me
I'll find God for Polyanna
A new life for Polyanna
So Polyanna don't feel my misery
She don't feel my misery
It goes to show the power you have over me

I'll find God for Polyanna
Send Light to Polyanna
Find God for Polyanna to me
I'll find God for Polyanna

Sponge,"Driving home late one night
Under lazy moon and green dashboard light
Turned on the radio
Heard a voice I heard before say
""That I ran away from home
When I was 13 years old
And why is the world so cold""
And you hope that the life
That you're carrying inside
Doesn't do what you do
Doesn't know the pain
You've been through
That your mother left your father
She fell in love with another
And he took it out on you

He don't stay out all night

And could someone there

He will many you someday

A plastic flag, with gum on the back fell out on the floor
Well, I picked it up and I ran outside, slapped it on my window shield
And if I could see old Betsy Ross I'd tell her how good I feel

But your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore
They're already overcrowded from your dirty little war
Now Jesus don't like killin', no matter what the reason's for
And your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore

Well, I went to the bank this morning and the cashier he said to me
""If you join the Christmas club we'll give you ten of them flags for free""
Well, I didn't mess around a bit, I took him up on what he said
And I stuck them stickers all over my car and one on my wife's forehead

But your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore
They're already overcrowded from your dirty little war
Now Jesus don't like killin', no matter what the reason's for
And your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore

Well, I got my window shield so filled with flags I couldn't see
So, I ran the car upside a curb and right into a tree
By the time they got a doctor down I was already dead
And I'll never understand why the man standing in the pearly gates said

""But your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore
We're already overcrowded from your dirty little war""
""Now Jesus don't like killin', no matter what the reason's for
And your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore""

Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast you know they never last no, no
What you need is a big strong hand to
Lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

He needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own

So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees to express himself
You've got to make him express himself, hey hey

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Spooks,"You won't believe the things I've seen
Far beyond your wildest dreams
I've seen chaos and order reign supreme
I've seen the beauty of the universe so peaceful and serene
In seconds turn to violence and screams

I've seen true genius
Too often elude the meaningless
Appreciation of this mediocre nation
I've heard the mindless repetition
Of empty words without tradition
Turn original verbs into submission
I smelled this malignerance addiction
But I guess I wouldn't be right
If I said the blunt was like a baby pipe
There ain't gonna be no revolution tonight
Half my warriors as high as a kite
Lost and they lost all they fight
And I've tasted, the bitter tragedy of lives wasted
And men who glimpsed the darkness inside, but never faced it
And it's a shame that most of y'all are followin' sheep
Wallowin' deeper than the darkness, you're fallin' asleep

You won't believe the things I've seen
Far beyond your wildest dreams
I've seen chaos and order reign supreme

I've seen and experienced things
That'll push the average to the edge and swan dive to death
I'm two guys, multiplied by ninety-three guys
Evenly balanced seein' evil equally in each eye now
Maybe I'm the most thorough worker on the job to you
Or maybe I'm the one, who was plottin' to rob you
The fear of this beatdown, no women or no cash to floss
Makes most of y'all hustle ya ass off
From nothin to two mill', in five years I'll live to see it
Vanish in six months, with no tears believe it, I'll rock
Twenty-eight years before the Feds can lay a trace
See they plan is to erase me, just to replace me

Hmm like, your heart is warring with your brain
Emotional or reason, now which one do you obey?
Hmm like, somebody callin' you insane
When overwhelmed and blessed
Bursting tears of happiness

Yo, yo, I've seen relationships that's so sick
Life long friendships so cha-o-tic
Thug cat bangin his chick but won't kiss
Drinkin her spit, when coppin a fix for dope bliss
I got a knife and a bat, to bust your brain
Put the knife in your back once in the life, I was trifling like that
Like my man Troy, who lost his days
Shootin' dice on worldly ways and ended up in a early grave
Because once in a lifetime is rough
Twice in a lifetime you combat the ghosts of mistrust
Mentally cuffed, thrust by a cop thinkin he tough
You bust, Amadou Diallo is us, and what
Now I'm on my knees, beggin GOD PLEASE
Save me from the fires of hell
Let water water soul prevail, 'cause I can't take no more
Who's that knockin', at, my door?
Is that you, Pete from Cobb's Creek, who died in his sleep?
We was playin' for fun, now it's keeps
Like my man Mark I beat to death wrapped in a carpet
And left in the garbage, damn now that's cold-hearted
Ask Book he saw it, ""Yo black I ain't seen shit!
Kids in the 6, they flip for nonsense""
Poke an icepick, smokin' that sniff, coke to preschool fool
And packin' a tool, fuck you Mom Dukes it's cool

With your leave Van Bushell said
He had further heard the cock crow
As he stumbled out the shed

Then blind Joseph came towards him
With a shotgun in his arms
He said you'll pay me twenty dollars
Before you leave my farm

Van Bushell saw the hook
Which replaced Joseph's hand
He said now calm you down my brother
Let's discuss this man to man

It's no good you getting angry
We must try to act our age
You're pursuing your convictions
Like some hermit in a cage

You're the son of your father
Try a little bit harder
Do for me as he would do for you
With blood and water bricks and mortar
He built for you a home
You're the son of your father
So treat me as your own

Well slowly Joseph well he lowered the rifle
And he emptied out the shells
Van Bushell he came towards him
He shook his arm and wished him well

He said now hey blind man that is fine
But I sure can't waste my time
So move aside and let me go my way
I've got a train to ride

Well Joseph turned around
His grin was now a frown
He said let me just refresh your mind
Your manners boy seem hard to find

Well there's two men lying dead as nails
On an East Virginia farm
For charity's an argument
That only leads to harm

So be careful when they're kind to you
Don't you end up in the dirt
Just remember what I'm saying to you
And you likely won't get hurt",Son of Your Father

His horse and his cattle are his only companions
He works in the saddle and sleeps in the canyons
Waiting for summer, his pastures to change
And as the moon rises he sits by his fire
Thinking about women and glasses of beer
And closing his eyes as the doggies retire
He sings out a song which is soft but it's clear
As if maybe someone could hear

Goodnight you moonlight ladies
Rockabye sweet baby James
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
Won't you let me go down in my dreams
And rockabye sweet baby James

Now the first of December was covered with snow
So was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston
The Berkshires seemed dream-like on account of that frosting
With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go

There's a song that they sing when they take to the highway
A song that they sing when they take to the sea
A song that they sing of their home in the sky
Maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep
But singing works just fine for me

So goodnight you moonlight ladies
Rockabye sweet baby James
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
Won't you let me go down in my dreams
And rockabye sweet baby James",Sweet Baby James

Why, did I steal your crowd?
I never knew you could be so vain

Don't run my life
Don't tell me what to play

Don't tell me what to say
It was hell living on the outside

So, its over now, here's your big surprise

Don't tell me what to play

Don't tell me what to say
At ""Soldiers and Sailors,"" we all knew
Busted fingers meant for you
A broken hand
I've got a broken heart
It wasn't the pressure
That tore me apart
it was you
Only you
Only you
Only you
No, you'll never shoot me down again
Looks like the table's turned

I'm not sure of what's in store for me
Hope, I'll dream, ! guess

Hold me close in your arms tonight.

Out there in the distance, in this world tonight.
Yesterday can't find us with your arms around me tight.

Just dream of me, however far away.
And hold me in your heart whenever you're afraid.

Painful to me
Pierce right through me
Can't you understand?
Oh my little girl
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
Vows are spoken
To be broken
Feelings are intense
Words are trivial
Pleasures remain
So does the pain
Words are meaningless
And forgettable
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

And coyotes are makin' a wail

When over yonder hill the moon is climbin'

Distract me from my wine
Across Tibetan mountains
Are memories of mine
I've stood some ghostly moments
With natives in the hills
Recorded here on paper
My chills and thrills and spills

Because dreams are made of this
Forever there'll be
A heaven in your kiss

A grape to tempt your leisure
Romantic gestures strange
My eagle flies tomorrow

She had a peculiar bonnet, 
But a youngish damsel figure 
With her tongue tied to a trigger, 
She seemed a total killer 
Her face all filled with filler, 
Her face a painting palette 
I stomached all her habits, 
Sipped her snow balls poshly like a judge 
But left her lipstick traces on her mug.

She looks like Bela Lugosi, 
She asked me for a ride home

And in the bar room mirror 
I combed right through her figure, 
She wiggled through the car park 
Into the pit of my heart, 
Sat herself beside me in my van 
A ring on every finger of her hand. 

She lived down by the river 
A flat the council give her, 
Wallpaper very scenic 
Her outlook very beatnik, 
We watched the close and weather 
Then through the door he entered, 
Short sleeves and arms of iron 
And me with just my tie on, 
She said the lodger's used to this by now 
I'd handled all the bull but not the cow. 

Behind her velvet sofa 
I found myself back sober, 
She kept an old acoustic 
She never ever used it,

The neon club lights of adult films and Trini Lopez, 
My arm around love but my acting was hopeless.

We kissed to the sound of the silence that we'd hired, 
Now captured, your love in my arms.

He took her in his Zephyr
They sat like salt and pepper

He told her how he loved her
Next night he called for her
But Dad protected daughter
And told him she was poorly
A lie was told there surely
So Michael felt rejected
This wasn't quite expected
He drove off to his local
Where he felt anti-social

She cried all night at missing
The boy she could be kissing
While he was falling over
He drunk himself back sober
And went home in a taxi
And crashed out in the back seat
He slept just like a baby
Which he hadn't done just lately
He saw her in the morning
Out with his sister Pauline
She felt all shy and soppy
He acted cool and cocky
He said tonight at Charlie's
There's going to be a party
I'll meet you at half seven

He tried again much later
It seemed to aggravate her
He drove home in silence

And very nearly missed him

Out on the windy common
That night I ain't forgotten

With some or other passions

With thoughts of our engagement
We stayed in by the telly

We spent our time just kissing
The Railway Arms we're missing

And all our time it took up

I got a job with Stanley
He said I'd come in handy
And started me on Monday
So I had a bath on Sunday
I worked eleven hours
And bought the girl some flowers
She said she'd seen a doctor
And nothing now could stop her

I worked all through the winter
The weather brass and bitter
I put away a tenner
Each week to make her better
And when the time was ready
We had to sell the telly
Late evenings by the fire
With little kicks inside her

This morning at four fifty
I took her rather nifty
Down to an incubator
Where thirty minutes later
She gave birth to a daughter
Within a year a walker
She looked just like her mother
If there could be another

And now she's two years older
Her mother's with a soldier
She left me when my drinking
Became a proper stinging

From bar to street to bookie
No more nights by the telly
No more nights nappies smelling

Alone here in the kitchen

Removing all her clothes

For ideals I had built 
And there we were in each other's arms

Our feet beneath us moved 
Professional her dance

The door opened wide and the light went on
He was drunk as a lord with a tyre mark hat
Falling in the hall on top of the cat
Singing Viva Espana to a crying wife
He took a swing at the shade on the light
They were knocking on the doors dressed like refugees
In the pouring rain on King George Street

Down on the corner the kids at his feet
As daddy comes home on King George Street

Sneezing into hankies hands all blue

With a bunch of flowers they locked him out

I'm in tune and I'm in love
I'm a piano that's made out of fruit
I'm the frog she chose to keep
Perhaps not a handsome prince
There is nothing I feel I've got to prove
CHORUS
If I fall in love again it could be the last time
If I fall in love again will I repeat
The mistakes that I made
And then make them again like a creep
This could be the last time
This could be the last time for me
If it's happiness you crave
Won't you look at me today
I'm smiling like the cat with all the cream
There's a swagger in my walk
A grade ""A"" in my report
I'm the salmon who made it back upstream
CHORUS
I'm a slightly chipped antique
In a market going cheap
That someday will be worth a thousand pounds
I've shed the walls of my coccoon
Normal service has resumed
There's no need to paint a face on this clown

Squeeze,"She was married and then divorced 
Things seemed to happen that way 
The children were confused, sometimes they'd fight 
Sitting in their toys and games 
To them she's mother and I am their friend 
Who sits with them on his lap 
And sleeps on the sofa on alternate weekends 
No substitute for their dad 
She's a very good mum 
As she tries to explain 
Everything that she can 
But a child's mind is sharp 
They imagine the worst 
Sometimes can't understand 
That there's so much to learn 
When you open a can of worms 

So to the park to play on the swings 
To give their mother a break 
When I saw their father walking down the path 
Heading down towards the gate 
I froze on the spot, heart in my throat 
I hoped he'd not see us there 
He soon disappeared and the kids on the slide 
Were happy and unaware 

I read the papers and made scrambled eggs 
The kids got ready to leave 
Their father was taking them for the weekend 
With pocket money and sweets 
They were excited as they waved goodbye 
And I went straight back to bed 
Their mother stood and watched as they drove away 
Standing on the front door step",Can of Worms

I want to ball the wall here

Till Highway 49 takes me to your gate

Happy in a Dixie world

I then fell in love

In his town and country car 
He watched the working women 
With the field hands from the farm 
He walked into the lobby 
With his pleased to see you smile 
Scribbled on to the register 
His fictitious name and smiled 
The footsteps of a young girl 
Came tapping along the hall 
The outline of his features 
Were shadowed on the wall 
She stood a little nervous 
Half lit by the neon light 
That flashed in many colours 
Through the darkness of the night

Like a well worn saddle 
Smiled as he said goodnight 
At the melody motel

As the girls wiped the tears from their eyes

His jeans down by his feet

The picture flickering slow

As they sat there all alone

In his town and country car 
His wife was cooking chicken 
With a baby in her arms 
The smell of home cooked dinner 
Filled the air at home that night

I could hear temptation call 
From a fly in her ointment 
To the big feather in her cap 
It's a small world we discover

I was in gear making up stories 
And we laughed at each other's tales

A suitcase tipped sideways at the end of the room 
I swallowed my sandwich and picked up her boots 
She turned just like an actress, a glare came my way 
I said what's the matter, what have I done today 
She spat out the name of the girl across the road 
I'll never forget the way she flared her nose 

Rose was the girl who some days I'd drive to work 
She worked in the office as an articled clerk 
Sometimes we had lunch in the pub along the street 
There was nothing between us, just good company 
I admit that I liked her but that's all it was 
I stood at the bedside in a state of shock 
She heard it different from a friend she met today 
Who says she saw us kissing down an alleyway 
I felt like two people a Jekyll and a Hyde

My nerves are ripped to shreds, the phone rings on the floor
But I can't pick it up, I can't take any more

There are planes flying in and there are planes flying out
I look up to the sky and I'm left in no doubt

Squeeze,"I bought a toothbrush, some toothpaste
A flannel for my face
Pyjamas, a hairbrush
New shoes and a case

I said to my reflection
Let's get out of this place
Past the church and the steeple
The laundry on the hill

Billboards and the buildings
Memories of it still
Keep calling and calling
But forget it all
I know i will

Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered
What's been going on
Now that you have gone

There's no other
Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered

I'm at the car park, the airport
The baggage carousel
The people keep on crowding
I'm wishing i was well
I said it's no occasion
It's no story i could tell

At my bedside empty pocket
A foot without a sock
Your body gets much closer
I fumble for the clock
Alarmed by the seduction
I wish that it would stop

I bought a novel, some perfume
A fortune all for you
But it's not my conscience
That hates to be untrue
I asked of my reflection
Tell me what is there to do",Tempted [Virgin Radio Session]
Squeeze,"My head was stuck in the cat flap on the door 
Where I could see her walking on the kitchen floor 
Down on my knees 
Just like a dog 
Begging for scraps that she said she hadn't got 
She took her pen she poked me in the eye 
As through the lock I looked to see my world inside 
I kicked and swore 
Void of all brain 
I couldn't see that I was the one to blame 

Cold shoulder 
Like a slaughtered cow in a butcher's fridge 
Cold shoulder 
She had laid the plans where we built our bridge 
To a better life 
Cold shoulder 

I had been chased by a hairbrush that she threw 
Life was blurred when the hand of fate came into view 
It smacked my face 
I was released 
I came back home where life became a feast 

Cold shoulder 
Like a slaughtered cow in a butcher's fridge 
Cold shoulder 
She had laid the plans where we built our bridge 
To a better life 
Cold shoulder 
Then I fell over 
Into a bush",Cold Shoulder
Squeeze,"There are planes coming in
And there's planes going out
One piece of luggage
Goes around and round
A lady cleans the floors
A night guard checks his watch
There's two lonely faces
And one of them's the clock
What crumbs of joy can I steal from this day
She didn't have the time to call me and say
If the things I'd heard were valid and true
I've got everything in the world but you
Everything in the world but you

I drive against traffic
People race in to work
I've got this expression
That I know I deserve

Squeeze,"Your initials on the singles 
That you chose to leave behind 
Sit in my collection 
They get played from time to time 
Left to remind me of something I'd forgot 
The images of loving before I lost the plot 
What was love to us 
Just sensation 
What was love to us 
The invitation 
To sit on my bed stand by a tree 
What were we feeling 
What was love to us 
 
The stagecoach would get held up 
On a Sunday afternoon 
We're dozing by the TV 
On a sofa with no room 
No room to lay out flat with her there by my side 
One eye on her movements one eye on Rawhide 

I just wasn't made for these times 
Spun around my record deck 
How green was my valley 
How blue the eyes that wept 
Looking back I don't think that I really cared 
This was my first lesson with nothing to compare",Images of Loving

That's not right 
I didn't want this to cause a fight

Throw out those thoughts of jealousy 
So don't you cry and hold your head 
It's over 
So wait a minute 
Let me explain 
Out of the blue she called again 
To offer me 
A peaceful meal 
So we can talk see how we feel 
It's nothing more than face to face 
So trust in me I know my place 
I know it's hard to let me go 
It's over 
All over 

Have confidence 
Have faith 
There is no attraction there 
And believe me 
This way 
I can wash her from my hair 

Hey wait a minute 
What's going on 
I'm coming home where I belong 
It's nothing more than face to face 
Give me the time to pack my case 
I know it's hard to let me go

Squeeze,"She's screaming into his collar 
Beating him on the chest 
He's showing her no emotion 
Their love's put to the test 
He thinks that he makes her happy 
By simply being there 
As the silences get longer 
The more she pulls her hair 
Love can be damaged by silence 
Tied to a ball and chain 
Love can be driven to violence 
From what once seemed so tame 
Wearing his dinner this evening 
Jolly comes home again 

The mule's sitting by the fire 
The house at his control 
He hops around the channels 
His eyes on film patrol 
She's driven from her senses 
Her mundane life erupts 
She leaps out of the sofa 
And jumps upon her lump 

The room was all dark and quiet 
In bed there side by side 
There in the small of her back 
An olive branch tonight 
He wants to say that he's sorry 
She wants to make him beg 
For all the pain that she's suffered 
In her heart and in her head",Jolly Comes Home
Squeeze,"The full moon's glowing
Blood red in the sky
It hangs like fire
On this winter's night
I sit on feelings
That hang in suspense
Nothing in my life makes sense
A question mark hangs with the stars up above
As I'm driving home to the one that I love
Sometimes I can't see the trees for the wood
Loving you tonight feels good
Loving you tonight feels good
Loving you tonight
Loving you tonight
The moonlight changes
From red into white
It sits on treetops
Asleep for the night
I see the signpost
The road slowly bends
Nothing in my life makes sense
A flashing tail light speeds across the sky
My head's cooking trouble as thoughts seem to fry
The last temptation was misunderstood
Loving you tonight feels good
Loving you tonight feels good
Loving you tonight
Loving you tonight
I'm faced with the ultimate truth
What if I see that things don't improve
I know they could
Loving you tonight feels good
Loving you tonight feels good
Loving you tonight feels good
The sun is rising
There's mist all around

Take me to your nest of china dolls 
Call me up your closest friend 
Join me in my neighbourhood patrol 
Happy me say happy me 
Chinese whispers bounce from ear to ear 
The night is young I feel so old 
See the stars above the night's so clear 
I used to come home late and lie, lie, lie 
She used to see through that but still I tried 
I couldn't cover up the tracks I'd made 
That's how it used to be but not today 

Race around I race around 
Focused on the here and now with you 
Every smile's a valentine 
What harm can a little loving do 
Fall about then fall about 
Drunk on love I can't stand on my feet 
Before I try please take my hand 
I've so many words left I should eat 

Tickle me please tickle me 
Laughter climbs the walls above our bed 
This night we have is built on love 
Help me so I do not lose the thread

Squeeze,"She gave to me her tenderness
Her friendship and her love
I see her face from time to time
There in the sky above
We grew up learning as we went
What a voyage our life could be
It took us through a wilderness
Into the calmest sea
Her smile could lift me from the pain
I often found within
She said some things I won't forget
She made a few bells ring
So simple her humility
Her beauty found in grace
Today she lives another life
In some fantastic place
She showed me how to raise a smile
Out of a bed of gloom
And in her garden sanctuary
A life began to bloom
She visualized a world ahead
And planned how it would be
She left behind the strongest love
That lives eternally
I have the hope that when it's time
For me to come her way
That she'll be there to show me around
Whenever comes that day
Her love was life and happiness
And in her steps I trace
The way to live a better life
In some fantastic place, some fantastic place.",Some Fantastic Place

Give me a page and I'd turn it

As much as I care 
I just can't pretend that 
The problem's not there 
We know all the boundaries 
From where we both stand 
Our life has been happy 
Without any plan 
But now I feel sorrow 
As friendship turns stale 
Our love's still on track but 
Without a third rail 
The moon has come up now 
The sun has gone down 
A million or more times 
Since you've been around 
Our life still goes on but 
It won't be the same 
As when we're together 
Love only knows pain 
With words that are tender 
Our love will prevail 
But can our love go on 
Without a third rail 

White clouds appear like cotton wool 
The wind bends trees to bow 
As we farewell this love of ours 
Like some old sacred cow 
As sure as heaven's above us 
And hell is down below 
Without a third rail to drive us 
We'll have no place to go 

There's a lump in my throat 
I'm choked as I say 
Our love has reached twilight 
Let's call it a day

Now is that love?
You cleaned me out you could say broke,

Now is that, is that
A teasing glance has pushed me out,
Now is that, is that
The tougher tougher tougher it gets
The more my lips frequent
Now that is love.

Beat me up with your letters, your walk out notes,
Funny how you still find me right here at home.
Legs up with a book and a drink,
Now is that love that's making you think.

You've called my bluff I'm not so hot,
Now is that love
My assets froze while yours have dropped,
Now is that, is that
It's the cupid cupid cupid disguise
That more or less survived
Now that is love.

Beat me up with your letters, your walk out notes,
Funny how you still find me right here at home.
Legs up with a book and a drink,
Now is that love that's making you think.

The easier love is found

Squeeze,"When I was crowned a mummy's boy by friends I didn't like 
I made a meal of trips to school upon my father's bike 
I used to sit between his legs, perched on a piece of wood 
If it ever rained on us, I'd slip beneath his hood 
And at home the radio was on 
From Julie Andrews to Jerry Garcia 
Life was all fun and games 
I was out of my head and underneath my bed 
Playing with electric trains 

At home the stereo was on 
My head was filled with rock 
I played a willow cricket bat guitar 
And soloed round the clock 
My records stacked up in a pile 
Collected from the charts 
And Top of the Pops 

Kneeling with torchlight shining 
Before me in my bed 
My eyeballs stuck in readers wives 
Pubic hairs proudly counted everyday 
Manhood took me slowly 
Out into the milky way 

I chased the girls and made them cry 
My hair grew down my back 
The passing of my teenage years 
Were spent down in the sack 
I played guitar and formed a band 
I puked up all night long 

As people came to sit and stare 
While I raced through my songs 
The sound of music passed by me 
Just like the Grateful Dead",Electric Trains

Its fruit falls

Spending all my wages on this peach 
When we could sit so very pretty

Our hearts, an interest

Expanding with the funk

She sticks close to her friends
And when the music ends
She is the Indian

From eyes that meet the love they seek
Interested to get close to you

The girl that looks at me
I will be trying
Her color unlike mine
Her hair the plaited vine
I will be climbing

My leg is always pulled
By friends who really would
But say they wouldn't
The joke's against my heart
Immediately she's barred
Their hearts are wooden

I feel we know each other so well
From eyes that meet the love they seek
Interested to get close to you

She walks towards the light
I walk towards the lines

By five she's gone again

Courage for the love look

It was all right then, love was there in a friend

Cold nights on sofas, the birds sing all night
Their song my story which sums up my life
The life I'm losing, the love I'll regret
No sheets, no pillows to make up by bed

Upon the toilet I think very hard
Love's in the tune of my Spanish guitar
And we're together now, harmony's been found

And the Spanish guitar can play

See how the zipper broke off of her dress 
Strangling her neck with his hands in her gloves

The frosted morning lawn 
The cloak of daylight has finally been drawn

And locked it tight inside his belt 
But she preferred his belt undone 
She bathed in his fortune but never his fun 
He cracked on a mixture of opera and drink

When I was a lad  I was a little bit shy. 
Something came along and caught my eye. 
When I heard the jazz band strike up  
I swear  I had my mind made up. 
Now I'm getting older 
Everything is in full swing. 
Now I'm getting bolder 
Man  I've got to do that thing. 
I used to walk along with the rest 
Now I've got something all my own 
Now you've got a little something new. 
Broke away  somehow. 
That's why I'm swinging it 
I've got my own thing now! 

Children put away your toys 
All your little children's games. 
Let the jazz band make some noise 
Step up ladies and watch out boys. 
""Mirror on the wall, 
who's the hot band in the hall?"" 
Let everybody sing 
Get on out there and do your thing.

Squirrel Nut Zippers,"In the afterlife 
You could be headed for the serious strife 
Now you make the scene all day 
But tomorrow there'll be Hell to pay 

People listen attentively 
I mean about future calamity 
I used to think the idea was obsolete 
Until I heard the old man stamping his feet. 

This is a place where eternally 
Fire is applied to the body 
Teeth are extruded and bones are ground 
Then baked into cakes which are passed around. 

Beauty, talent, fame, money, refinement 
Top skill and brain 
But all the things you try to hide 
Will be revealed on the other side.

And the N and the A 
And the T and the I-O-N

Then get fitted for a suit of flame",Hell

Then gets his mind on something new?
You've got to let me know
I'm all alone

Is it you, baby?

Seem to understand my point of view

I'm finding ways to make things fall in line
I know how tricky things can be

And all the stars are there before us
Listen here  some things are meant to be
Tried to take it slow tried to lose control  
But I'll tell you what the trick is
What you get is what you had to give away

When I learned  
I found my eyes were opened
Long ago I had a dream that quickly faded
Goes to show how tricky dreams can be
But wouldn't you agree that
Those who know 
Will whisper when they see us walking, ""There's a love that's always meant to be""",Meant to Be

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

St. Germain,"Here, at this final hour, in this quiet place
Harlem has come to bid farewell
To one of its brightest hopes
Extinguished now and gone from us, forever

For Harlem is where he worked
And where he struggled and fought
His home of homes, where his heart was
And where his people are

And it is therefore, most fitting
That we meet once again in Harlem
To share these last moments with him
The black man, black

For Harlem has ever been gracious
To those who have loved her, have fought for her
And have contended her honor
Even to the death

It is not in the memory of man that this [Incomprehensible], unfortunate
But nonetheless, proud community has found a braver
More gallant, young champion
Than this Afro-American, who lies before us
Black, black, black

Did you ever talk to brother Malcolm?
Did he ever touch you?
Did you have him smile at you?
Did you ever really listen to him?

Did he ever do a mean thing?
We must honor him
For what he was, and is
A prince, our black shinning prince

Don't even have drive, I can sit on the couch

You skurred to face me, you don't wanna race me

I'm a do it for me and let you do it for her

I got a real bad habit when I wanna grab it
So many karats in the ring I'm half man, half rabbit
Bitches be like, ""Ahh man"" when they see me with Cardin
Puffin on the green, discussin' a war plan

I used to have rock, now it's stocked with a laptop
Fat pot, a six-four with the ass dropped
With a dime daughter, dabbed in Estee Lauder
I want the new Tims so from the crib I made an order

Get ya Xed out, leave ya stretched out in the room, my doom

Hopin' I could give you some love in the right way
But I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I keep it mellow, sayin' hello, you still thinkin' I'm a thug fellow

You a cutie with thighs and you live for dinero
But, me and my team drop, shit overseas
Then bounce wit' the ounce that's thick and Japanese

Got 'em winin' like spoiled babies in play pens
Put that ass up baby and I hit it from here
Now lick your tongue out lady and I put it in here

Full of smiles, we can't help it, but why?

Fantasizing what's under that Vokal and you between my thighs
See, you want studio time, in and outta town doin shows

And becoming intellectually wealthy

Same cat shoppin with rats, throwin the mice out
I like 'em clumsy mo', just let everything hit the flo'
Not once, not twice, three times, but fo'
Each time, makin her knees touchin her elbows
I said, each time, lookin at me, yellin she want mo'
I'm like, ohh!

(Chorus)

(Nelly - talking)
Baby girl like to shake a lot, huh, baby girl like to shake a lot
Huh, baby girl like to, uh, uh, uh, uh
Do your thizzle Moet, hah, hah, and do your thizzle Moet
Hah, hah, shake it like that for, hah, yeah
Three-one-four fo' sho', S-T-L and I connect the do'",Let Me in Now
St. Lunatics,"[Chorus: ]
Ooh, I loved you so
But why I loved you, I'll never know
Ooh, the pain you put me through
You know you've killed, my love for you

You know I loved you right
I never, I never knew girl, you see
You know the pain right, you can feel my pain right?
Uh, to the gateway, now check it out, yo

Now since I've came in the game, money and fame, I love it
But whoever thought I'd wake up one mornin' with no budget
It's Cardi the golden kid with that older shit
I live, learn, learn to live, the older I get
And I remember Thursdays, hungry Thursdays
'Bout sixteen, seventee, um, Murphy age
But this rap game I love it, it's like I'm married to it
I proposed on Clue?, she said I'd be happy to do it
Gave her a kiss, mmmwwhha, she gave me fifty G's
Silly Cardi I spent it, now Cardi on his knees
Now I'm livin' reality, a Biggie Smalls theme
Askin' for one more chance to show her what I really mean

She said, you done seen a lotta things baby bro'
Even best friends turned and take out videos
I got with the 'tics, EI, still no deal
'Til Sugar said ""chill baby, everything is fo' Reel""
See'mon

[Chorus: ]
(Ali - talking through chorus)
Yeah, loved why'all punk ass nigga, showed why'all love
Never know that shit
How the fuck you gon' drop a group, and the got the number one shit on the radio?
Dumb ass nigga, look at us now, fo' Reel nigga, fo' Reel

Nineteen-ninety-six! (hurry up, sign right here), let's sign these papers
So we can get these papers and give these hoes the vapors
Double-dumb entertainment dropped ""Gimme What You Got""
Off top, 'tics hot, even sent you a shot (Double-dumb nine sevennnnnnnn!)
Didn't want Nelly on it, said his verse didn't fit
Some ol' separatin shit, ten percent ass bitch
Whole town love us, no one is above us
Treated you, no talent, knowin' niggas like brothas
No street team, no promotion
Just woof tickets, raw fuckin', no lotion
One year later you decide to drop an Ep
At the same time drop us, that confuse me

So like a bastard child, we on our own
Put out and left alone, why'all won't answer the phone
It took a little time, but we got it ourself
Five million records later, now why'all askin' for wealth
(One, two, three, four, five), nigga please

[Chorus: ]
(Murphy Lee - talking during chorus)
You know what I'm sayin', life is crazy, you know what I'm sayin'
You got choices in life
But bro' when you make 'em, you gotta make 'em and make 'em right
And if you ain't makin' 'em right it's just crazy
You ain't got nobody else to blame, nobody but yourself
You know what I'm sayin', mad truth to that

Let me pretend that I'm a lawyer and explain the situation
Facin' three-to-one five across state, humiliation
St. Louis set it off, phone calls was long distance
(Ay yo, it's four birdies in Houston), c'mon, send some one to get 'em

Who would do it for a grand?
Eighteen, only thing on our mind was that killer money
From Missouri to the T-e-x-a-s
Two cats strapped it tight, right up under her chest
One-way trip on Southwest but she didn't make it that far
Metal detectors went bizarre, one-way trip to the car
Your honor, she got a baby that'll drive my granny crazy
A long distance lawyer that keep on tellin' us ""maybe""
And we all raise her baby, takin' care of her daily
This law shit is crazy, never cease to amaze me
It's different from the eighties, ninety-five to lately
They givin' out time like dogs givin' out rabies

It's a Midwest thang, y'all - and they ain't got a clue

It's a Midwest swang, y'all - and they ain't gotta trip

Cause we do big thangs on the muh'fuckin hip
It's a Midwest thang

Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
What you think we live on a farm?  Nigga be for real
We got Benz's Rovers' and Jag's, Hummer's and Deville's
Got a green S Class, ain't broke the door seal
Shit ain't been the same since I signed Fo' Reel
This shit got ill, when I hit 4 mill
Five and countin', dirty six at will
Did seven on the slide, 8 worldwide
I'll be on my third Bentley by the time I'm at 9
I hear 'em cryin, ""You gon' sell out"" ya damn right
I done sold out before and re-comped the same night
Straight hopped the next flight, too *Icey* for sunlight
Dunkin without Sprite, yea you heard me dirty
I'm from the Show-Me State, show me seven I'll show you eight
Karats in one bling, heavily starched jeans
Representin St. Louis everytime I breathe
In the city I touch down and I bob and weave, ay

[Murphy Lee]
I sport my beeper on my boots, that's why I be a buzz when I kick
Maybe it's on my lips, it's chaos when I spit
Quarter man, quarter schoolboy, half Lunatic
Quarter rubber, quarter dick, other half in yo' chick
Keep a quarter of some sheeeiit, I'm the Pooky of the backyard
All colors and all types like a junkyard
Hot young boy with hot young ways
Cause I connect three blunts and be high for three days
You can tell by the way I walk I ain't from 'round hurr (here)
Probably couldn't tell 'cause I ain't walkin nowhurr (nowhere)
I got a old-school Cutlass, with a hole in the urr (air)
TV's urrwhurr (everywhere) wood grain to sturr (stare)
I don't curr (care), hell naw I ain't cuttin my hurr (hair)
Ten and a half in them Airforce 1's, gimme two purr (pair) ugh
I'm from the Lou' and what I do is a Lou' thang
One rapper, two rings and three chains

[Kyjuan]
Nothing but some ole country boys that ride V-12 horses
Saddle up and put spurs on my Airforce's
Back porches made for hide and go seek
We got space out hurr, we can ride and chief
Ain't gotta worry 'bout nobody approachin' us
By the time they catchin' up, we smoked it up
And my eyes be red, my lips a lil' dark
The Lou is more than the Rams, Cards and lil' Arch
My dirty's love to spark, and love to sparkle
Love homies *Vokal* coats with matchin' car do's (doors)
We racin down Skinker, see how fast our car go
Granny be like ""Ay-yi-yi"" like Ricky Ricardo
I know you want to know why we do what we do
You cats ain't got a clue why the Cutlass blue
Brand new twenty-two's on new UP's
With one, two, three, four, five TV's

I'm sittin' on the front porch, writin a hood rhyme
Waitin on my connect to deliver that good line
Wish I would find, one seed in my weed
Sticks and shit, if I do somebody bleed
Pull right here, eight pounds of Chinamen
Two stay hittin some blunts and Heineken
Hidin in the back with the po' po'
kicked in my do'do', man they some ho' hooo's
They put the gun to my earr, you know the Lord don't fear
Nann nigga, nann hoe, let's keep that bullshit clearr
They had me face down in the skreet
Errbody watchin, thinkin I'ma pull the heat
And leave the D-tects with a leak in the skreet

Swallowin Cris' 'til we spit up, put your shit up cause now

God over satan, no debatin, so I'm celebratin
This new life, off the block buyin stock
Divin off the dock in Bangkok, I used to slang rock
And it was so hard, but now the wallet sport a gold card
Bitches goin nuts when the rims hit the boulevard
Hustle hard, the whole inside glowin
From the T.V.s, diamonds went from hard to see to 3-d
Double VD, bubble Lex with the CD
Puffin seaweed, I'm free, hit the slope and ski
DC to France, finance is too advanced
Wit' plans to cause a trance, money stands yellin ""romance!""
I never stop comin, gunnin, runnin and sunnin
With Cuda spinnin them hun'neds on hun'neds spinnin and blunted

I'm like okay, niggas brought they cars out
Thick broads out, all the stars out
We ain't been here two minutes, mami already yellin
""What a nigga gon' do with it, can we hop in the Infinite?""

I'm like okay, niggas brought they cars out
Thick broads out, all the stars out
We ain't been here two minutes, mami already yellin
""What a nigga gon' do with it, can we hop in the Infinite?""

Five deep in a Yuko', we struggle by toes, we still ghetto
Float St. Louis, fake insurance, with no petro
Nuts are heavy, Teddy Peddy tell 'em to let go
'Tics are ready, Kevin Law tell 'em I said so
I let go, sixteen out of sixty-four
And the forty-eight bars left'll have you keekin for mo'
Women be like ""who do y'all think y'all are?""
I'm Mr. pull up in big trucks, I'm far from a star
Cause I'm the sun, the reason why the day gon' come
One out of five reasons why they hatin on us
Tracks is like a gas tank, I fill 'em on up
And my shows is robbery style, they givin it up
I'm like a Michael Jackson concert, a milli' and up
And these haters are like a comedy, be buggin me up
They women treat me like cows, they be pullin my stuff
And to get that up outta me more, they be suckin me off

I'm like okay, niggas brought they cars out
Thick broads out, all the stars out

Now you know Mo, I stay equipped with a zip
And the soles of my Air Force One's on e'ry trip
And on e'ry whip I choose those D's to roll
(What them niggas 'round the corner gon' start shit for?)
When they know, oh, he keep a stash in the Nav'
Pop a half and take out your Ave. on my behalf
My whole staff love to laugh and count the money
On the couch, hands in our pants like Al Bundy
I love smoke ganjä, Monday to Monday
And e'ry other day a nigga fuckin with gun play
It's ok, since all the dogs out
All my broads out, doin they bought the bar out
And we rollin, Henny holdin and blunt rollin
Money foldin, been in more rings than Hulk Hogan
It's official, Nelly Hummer clean as a whistle
You boys signed to Fo' Reel, you doin your thug thizzle

I'm like okay, niggas brought they cars out
Thick broads out, all the stars out
We ain't been here two minutes, mami already yellin

Kyjuan's a preppy hippy, cross the bridgy of Mississippi
I slang thangs, make bread, easy like Jiffy
Call me a cool nigga or a Mr. refriger'
Kids ask me (""Mr. can you get crunk and jiggy?"")
I reply quickly, bottle of Andres or Crissy
Smoke backyard or sticky, my man, watch me get busy
I wake up with two dimes, both named Nikki
I'm a playa dirty, no passion marks, no hickies
Cats make me sick when I roll through why'all city
Lookin like angry mad, face mad, teeth gritty
You gon' make me go back into my days of you-City
Cornrows, penny bros and new Dickies
Ah shit, when situation looks shitty
I got that thang with me, plus I Puff like Diddy
You niggas can't hang with me, or pop the pain with me
So wrap somethin' mo' and hop in the Range with me

Check, check
No picture me rollin, Optimo, glocka four-four
Four-do' Range Rov', mink with matchin Kangol
Whole hood like ""oh"", freakin 'em out they mind
D's with diamonds on 'em, jackers, I know they want 'em
Not, you see the watch, Rollie or G-shot
You hear me four, five blocks before you see me, that's the knock
I need not speak on that, I speak on Zack
And how he better fix my shit or give my eight G's back
Salute the rugged, flip screen, you gotta love it
Navigational system behind the ten, duckin the public
Take my chain off to thaw out, battle four out
We fill, the fattest wad a hun'neds you ever saw out
Son break the jar out, twist the muskie
Only real niggas ride and smoke, patna trust me
If I'm lyin, bad mouth, slap then crush me
Cuss me, suplex lamb, grab the nine and bust me
'Cause only

Fuck that Cris', let it spill, I hit the gas, and make it peel
I'm smokin' twenty inches of Parelli, wha, up off the wheel
I hit the jewelry store at noon, slight case of the chills
I got the face too damn chunky 'cause it's still read ""twelve""
Well hell, not a shit starter but I be startin' some shit
Half the time I'm in the club, half the niggas gettin' pissed
Me, got they miss, I done, caught they wrist
And they be thinkin' you cockblockin 'cause you gave her a kiss
I walks over to your bitch and asks her ""who's is this?""

Tell 'em one more time just in case he forgets
I be the sleepy eyed, kinky guy, the chinky eye
Comin' be like I, ay, EI, ready the guy
Nigga hella high, country grammar, yellin ""EI!""
Fuckin' your cutie pie, forty-nine, not gettin' none

You shoulda' seen this ladie's face when I walked in the bank
I'm the school boy, I'm Hollywood, smellin' like dank
Lookin' like I don't know left from right
Holdin' a check, got the whole front desk like ""Murphy's set for life!""
I agree wit' em, I exchange sacks with seeds in 'em
Drivin' eighty in the rainiest Rov', TV's in 'em
I'm St. Lou, plus true to the arch equals I'm real
I'm Hollywood, plus true to the heart equals a mil'
I'm killin' y'all, matter fact I'm killin' myself
In a category with T-Boz, I'm feelin' myself
It gets no better, Slo says it gotta get better
Gotta get wood, gotta get dubs, we gotta get leather
I'm like, what, real playas roll on dubs (Lunatics like)
And haters can't kick it wit' us (and our blunts tight)

We the Lunatics, no doubt
They wildin, they don't know

Ay yo
St. Louis is small but we still do it all
We hit the mall, we drink it all, we always gon' smoke it all
Get hit, we shake it off, at the club yellin ""take it off""
My success is takin off, I'm always workin, never takin off
I done that, did that, who her? I done hit that
Cats be trippin off them rats, I ain't really with that
Makes me wanna sit back, I relax and think back
To when I used to click-clack, makes me angry when I flash back
Mo, you should get back, I mean this, hang with the meanest
Remain the cleanest, always smoke the seedless greenest
You've seen this like reruns, pop-a-lock like reruns
St. Louis where we from, you ain't never heard a weak one

You got to stand up and get it together, roll with the punches, whatever
Get in our way, destroy ya, make you wish you had never, ever
Fucked with the real crazy, pyscho sick move the lady
Sunnin so nut and shady, kid pass me the three-eighty
By my sack, cock and load it, your world I'm a rock and roll it
My business, you shouldn't a told it, to end I'm a forty-four
They switch guns and they go for show it, your pupils is dilating
This rap is so beautiful watch The Source give it higher ratings
The 'tics just can't be faded, to nothin that's star related
More than just duplicated, Kenjuana's to celebrated
Got damnit we finally made it, haters they gotta hate it
Bought my house off and finally paid it, often intoxicated
Just call me the Don-dotta, original rider, rider
Your mama just gotta, gotta, take her home and here ""splatter, splatter""
Splatter, splatter, I'm from St. Louie

Get them things out and cock 'em, anything bubble I'm poppin
Anything stumble, I'm droppin, whatever you rollin, I'm toppin

No more slanging rocks, I rock rocks, you duck cops, I cop drops
You buy cock, I buy stock, touch mine, you are not
I'm Rocafella with hard knocks, dome shots 'til I get popped
Used to ball on the blacktop now I balls on hardwood
With enough finance stability to finance a small hood
Call it Nellyville nigga, and guess who the mayor
My whole towns chronic'd out so we drug aware
I'm playin truth or dare with dime pieces, and they nieces

I'm like a New Edition y'all not Ronnie Bobby and Mike
Not even Ricky Ralph or Johnny, instead it rain tonight
Is this the end? Damn right I, turn out like Ike
Until Vanessa Del Rio like over Bryan McKnight
Said oh no, baby doll kissin me as she goin down low
Peepin that demo oh I can tell that you a pro
Swore up and down you never did this before
Whatever just go slow
Hated by all types, baby fathers and dykes
The type they ready to fight cause I'm the one they women like
He think he tight, he think he got more game then spike lee
Running through his veins like an IV, high speed
Tightest nigga for five G's of Al D.
Better catch me now while my price is low
Demandin five digits when the Lunatics blow
Another zero for a show, just to let you niggas know, now what?

[Chorus]

You see me and my niggaz only come out on the weekends
Cause the weekdays too busy creepin
Freakin, wit yo' rat, now picture that
When she with you she not speakin, but she weaken
Lettin me know, that she really been thinkin
About a nigga oh, even when I'm not wit her
I'm frosty all year while you only in the winter
My pockets gettin fatter, your pockets gettin thinner
I ain't baptized so you callin me a sinner
Overpaid, twenty nine, callin me a young tenor
Nelly stop don't leave, don't stop when I'm in her
Ready for whatever and I ain't even bought her dinner
I, started the game on the bench with splinters
Beggin your coach let you play for a minute
The last seconds of the game you still waitin to enter
I ain't gotta hear the buzzer boy I know who the winner, come on

I said you don't wanna roll where I could go
Hard times, Hennessey an' Optimos
Twenty inches on the car, gotta lock the doors

Ay yo, I'm Chachee the Navihater
Fuck shoes, I want the whole fuckin' alligator
Murphy rather put the shoes on a Navigator
Size twenties that could kick it like a soccer player

Been a player since Freeze Pops, nigga, 'Now 'N Laters'
I used to be well connected like an operator
I used to rub on some of the teachers an' administrators
Woulda' hit it, but yo, I'm not a good cooperator

That's why the, that's why
The people wanna get me for pollutin' the sky
Factory full a bud, got the whole city high
St. Louis peoples can't cooperate without

True smooth figga, coochie licker, relationshipper
Damn right, I'm wit' her 20, 4, 5, she gettin' thicker

By the daily, as a child they couldn't fade me
Brotha, my league's speakin' the truth, I'm only eighteen
Do the math, killed a pig, chicken an' cow
My third eye's so versatile, it make me smile

At myself, damnit, I'm in the backfield like Emmit
My life is a movie, goddamnit
Give me a Grammy or a meal ticket
I ain't picky until I get it, we can still kick it
Gimme a minute to handle business 'cause I'm real wit it

Soon as I'm finished, yo, we can deal wit' it
Bill wit it, Lunatic skills to make a mil' wit' it
We ain't black, we original
The deal is y'all don't see it's all Biblical

St. Lunatics did it all
From high school ball to feelin' booties in the hall
Skip school, buyin' Nikes, twenty deep up in the mall
Me an' my dogs, found a road to make it flow

Got money to go, fuck somethin', we want it all
Done worked too hard to see it fall
Seven years to get our name on the wall, Cuda called
That did it all 'cause we cool now, pockets grab for now
I'm like Jordan in ninety-five, no Bull now

Promotional tours now, funky like sewers now
Six hundred with duals now, like tractors got pull now
We in a good situation like Phil an' Shaq
On our way up the hill like Jill an' Jack

Now my name starts your sentence, you'z a hater by law
I'm by far tighter than training bras on Dolly Parton

You think your girl don't like us? You'z a joke like Steve Martin
I've been pardoned for sayin' Lunatics no competition
I lay tracks like a beautician while your gal's on a mission
While you trippin', pink-slippin', it's your gal I be pimpin' 'cause
I'm the boss and this is how it's gone be

Now tell me why everybody want to watch me now?
And the, fly honeys want to rock me now
And them playin' hatin' fellas tryin' to hunt me down
But they always on my jock when I come around

I hit the spot and keeps it hot when I lays it down
I see a lot of ladies, tell Mary-Go-Round
Droppin' hits like this, so you can pay me now
And uh

Are you lost without your lamb?

In the garden-grey pallor of lines across your face

Stabbing Westward,"She's been here so many times before she can't remember 
When she last felt anything at all but this pain and anger 
She stares intently at the door  listens for his footsteps 
She knows exactly what's in store  and the knowing makes it worse 
When he calls her daddy's little girl  she doesn't hear him 
When he crushes her  she can't feel her screams are silent 
Hides in the corners of her mind where she plays contently 
She leaves this nightmare far behind, she escapes inside her dreams 

Floating high above her bed 
Staring at her father's head 
Wishing one of them were dead 
So this hell could finally end",Sleep

We would be if we'd have tried
A little harder?
It seems like yesterday
That we were making plans
For the future

But it's been so long
Since I have known the truth
Those dreams we've left abandoned
And I'm haunted by your face
And the memory of your kisses
Sweet kisses

Do you remember?
I still remember so much
I remember never feeling so alive
Do you remember?
I still can't forget your touch
We swore that we would never end
We knew our love transcended space and time

These memories slip away
The ghost of what we were
Is fading
But there is no more pain
Which is funny 'cause that night
I was dying
I was dying

Now I don't even recognize
The girl I swore that someday
I would marry
But I can't forget her face
And I can't forget her kisses

I still remember so much
I remember always feeling so alive
Do you remember?

Do you remember?
I still can't forget your touch

All I need is the air I breathe
All I need is the air we breathe

There's so many things we need so desperately
And the TV preaches, we can't live without them
You tell me what is need, I'll tell you what I believe
If I owned the world without you it would all be worthless

'Cause you are everythin', the only thing that matters
You are everythin', the only thing I need
You are everythin', the only thing that matters
Yes you are everythin', you are the air I breathe

What if someday we took all their toys away
You think they'd find the strength to go on living
'Cause deep inside I know if I lost everything I owned
I'd be a king as long as you're beside me

'Cause you are everythin', the only thing that matters
'Cause you are everythin', the only thing I need
Our love is everythin', the only thing that matters
Yes you are everythin', you are the air I breathe

The air I breathe
The air I breathe
The air I breathe
The air I breathe

I hope someday they find a place to bid online
Where all lost souls can buy their life some meanin'
All I know we'll survive, all we need is more time
As long as we've got love and only ocean

'Cause we are everythin', the only thing that matters
We are everythin', there's nothin' else I need
Our love is everythin', the only thing that matters
Yes, you are everythin', you are the air I breathe

The air I breathe
The air I breathe
The air I breathe
The air I breathe
The air I breathe
The air I breathe

You are like a Saint, the only Saint that matters
You are everythin', there's nothin' else I need
'Cause you are everythin', the only thing that matters
Our love is everythin', you are the air I breathe
You are everythin', you are the air I breathe

How much you've changed

Why can't it be
Perfect like it used to be?
Why can't we be

Open up as lonely as the space between the stars

But every time that I touch you
You feel so far away
And every time that you need me
I feel so far away

As you lie silently beside me choking back your tears
I wonder if you recognize
That silence now defines us
Desperately I try to fight this overwhelming sense
That I may never find
The strength to change
How hopeless we've become

But every time that I touch you
You feel so far away
And every time that you need me
I feel so far away

I desperately try to remember

I see numb empty faces
The world is wating to die
And this apathy is so suffocating
The slow decay of my mind

For someone with answers
To questions that are plaguing me
I scream in vain to anyone who'll listen

Stacey Earle,"I almost hate to go back home
Somebody's died every time I've been gone
I ain't saying I don't want to know
Just that it brings me down so low

I was needing more out of life
I forgot how to be your wife
Everybody's settlin' for settlin' down
Hear the jingle of the chains rattling around

I never really gave much thought
I'm sure it's my own fault
I just figured after years gone by
All them tears would have run dry

I go out night after night
And I wonder if I'm treating myself right
And I think about the ones I left behind
When I cry night after night

Here's to the ones who worked all along
Living in fear of being alone
Well I started out early in life
I made mine and I knew I

Could never really go back home
That's the same as being alone
Sure, I could always turn it around
That'd be the same as shooting me down

Would be to capture me

I fell and it was swell

Here and there and yonder
Wasting precious time

Fishing for salmon
Losing at backgammon

What joys un-tasted
My nights were sour
Spent with Schopenhauer

Stacey Kent,"A country dance was being held in a garden?
I felt a bump and then an ""Oh, beg your pardon"" 
""Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams""
Wrapped around a pug-nosed dream 
The music started and was I a perplexed one 
I held my breath and said 
""May I have the next one""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams 
""Wrapped around a pug-nosed dream""
There were questions in the eyes of other dancers?
As we floated over the floor?
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more 

Now in a cottage full of lilacs and laughter
I learned the meaning of the words ""ever after""
And I'll only see polka dots and moonbeams

The colors of a rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are there on the faces, of people going by
I see friends shaking hands, sayin, how do you do
They're really sayin' (I, love, you).

I hear babies cry, I watch them grow

A whole lot more than I'll never know)
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
Yes I think to myself, what a wonderful world.",What a Wonderful World
Stacey Kent,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You
Stacey Kent,"A fine romance, with no kisses
 A fine romance, my friend this is
 We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes
 But you're as cold as yesterday's mashed potatoes
 A fine romance, you won't nestle
 A fine romance, you won't wrestle
 I might as well play bridge
 With my old maid aunt
 I haven't got a chance
 This is a fine romance

 A fine romance, with no kisses
 A fine romance, my friend this is
 We two should be like clams in a dish of chowder
 But we just fizz like parts of a Seidlitz powder (*)
 Yes, a fine romance, with no glitches
 A fine romance, with no bitches
 You're just as hard to land as the 'Isle de France'
 I haven't got a chance
 This is a fine romance

 A fine romance, my good fellow
 You take romance, and I'll take jello
 You're calmer than the seals
 In the Arctic Ocean
 At least they flap their fins
 To express emotion
 A fine romance with no quarrels
 With no insults and all morals
 I've never mussed the crease
 In your blue serge pants
 I never get the chance
 This is a fine romance

 Yes, a fine romance, my dear, duchess
 Two old fogeys, who need crutches
 True love should have the thrills that a healthy crime has
 But we don't have the thrills that the march of time has, ba-ba-da-day
 A fine romance, my good woman
 My strong, age in the wood, woman
 You never give the orchids I sent a glance
 No, you like cactus plants, ha ha
 This is a fine romance

 A fine romance, my dear duchess
 Two old fogeys, who need crutches

 True love should have the thrills that a healthy crime has
 You know Louis, we don't have half the thrills that the march of time has,

 My strong, aged in the wood, woman
 You never give the orchids I sent a glance

 No I prefer Cactus plants

Stacey Kent,"Quiet nights 'n quiet stars, quiet chords from my guitar
Floating on the silence that surrounds us
Quiet thoughts 'n quiet dreams, quiet walks by quiet streams
Climbing hills where lovers go to watch the world below together

We will live eternally in this mood of reverie away 
from all the earthly cares around us
My world was dull each minute until I found you in it
And all at once the happiness I knew,
Became these quiet nights of loving you!

Stacey Kent,"This is just a little samba
Built upon a single note
Other notes are bound to follow
But the root is still that note

Now this new note is the consequence
Of the one we've just been through
As I'm bound to be
The unavoidable consequence of you

There's so many people
Who can talk and talk, and talk
And just say nothing
Or nearly nothing

I have used up all the scale
I know and at the end
I've come to nothing
I mean nothing

So I come back to my first note

As I come back to you
I will pour into that one note
All the love I feel for you

Any one who wants the whole show
Re mi fa so la ci do

Stacie Orrico,"O holy night! The stars are brightly shining,
It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth.
Long lay the world in sin and error pining.
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!
O night divine, the night when Christ was born;
O night divine, O night divine!

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming,
Now come the wisemen from out of the Orient land.
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friends.
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!
O night divine, the night when Christ was born;
O night divine, O night divine!
O holy night
Christ is born",O Holy Night
Stacie Orrico,"What child is this, who, laid to rest
On Mary's lap, is sleeping
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,
While shepherds watch are keeping

This, this is Christ the King,
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
Haste, haste to bring him laud,
The Babe, the Son of Mary!

So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh,
Come peasant king to own Him,
The King of kings, salvation brings,
Let loving hearts enthrone Him.

This, this is Christ the King,
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
Haste, haste to bring him laud,
The Babe, the Son of Mary!

What child is this child
What child is this child",What Child Is This?
Stacie Orrico,"I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten
and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow.

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white.

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white.

Stacie Orrico,"I've got it all, but I feel so deprived
I go up, I come down and I'm emptier inside
Tell me what is this thing that I feel like I'm missing
And why can't I let it go

There's gotta be more to life...
Than chasing down every temporary high to satisfy me
Cause the more that I'm...
Trippin' out thinkin' there must be more to life
Well it's life, but I'm sure... There's gotta be more

(Than wanting more)

I've got the time and I'm wasting it slowly
Here in this moment I'm half-way out the door
Onto the next thing, I'm searching for something that's missing

There's gotta be more to life...
Than chasing down every temporary high to satisfy me
Cause the more that I'm...
Trippin' out thinkin' there must be more to life
Well it's life, but I'm sure... There's gotta be more

I'm wanting more

I'm always waiting on something other than this
Why am I feelin' like there's something I missed....
Always... Always...

There's gotta be more to life...
Than chasing down every temporary high to satisfy me
Cause the more that I'm...
Trippin' out thinkin' there must be more to life
Well it's life, but I'm sure... There's gotta be more

There's gotta be more to life...
Than chasing down every temporary high to satisfy me
Cause the more that I'm...
Trippin' out thinkin' there must be more to life
Well it's life, but I'm sure... There's gotta be more

More to life
There's gotta be more to life (more to life)
There's gotta be more to life (more)
More to my life
